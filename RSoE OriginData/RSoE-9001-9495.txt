AB Mapping requires a meaningful generalization of information. For vegetation maps, classification is frequently used to generalize the species composition of (semi-)natural plant assemblages. As an alternative to classification, ordination methods aim to extract major floristic gradients describing the prevailing compositional variation in a floristic data set as metric variables. This ability has been used previously to derive gradient maps of homogeneous landscapes that show plant species composition in continuous fields. In the present study, gradient mapping was used in a more heterogeneous landscape with intricate environmental gradients and higher variation in vegetation physiognomy. Since established ordination methods may have difficulties to cope with the highly variable plant species composition, we tested the novel method Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap) against conventional methods (Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling). The resulting floristic gradients were related to hyperspectral imagery (HyMap) using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and subsequently mapped. Prediction uncertainties are provided as additional map. Isomap was able to preserve 74% of the original variation inherent to the floristic data set in a three-dimensional solution. This was considerably more than the established techniques achieved. The PLSR models for the floristic gradients extracted with Isomap showed model fits ranging from R-2 = 0.59 to R-2 = 0.73 in calibration and from R-2 = 0.55 to R-2 = 0.69 in tenfold cross-validation. The resulting gradient map provides detailed information on compositional vegetation patterns. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Landslide inventory mapping is an indispensable prerequisite for reliable hazard and risk analysis, and with the increasing availability of very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery the creation and updating of such inventories on regular bases and directly after major events is becoming possible. The diversity of landslide processes and spectral similarities of affected areas with other landscape elements pose major challenges for automated image processing, and time-consuming manual image interpretation and field surveys are still the most commonly applied mapping techniques. Taking advantage of recent advances in object-oriented image analysis (OOA) and machine learning algorithms, a supervised workflow is proposed in this study to reduce manual labor and objectify the choice of significant object features and classification thresholds. A sequence of image segmentation, feature selection, object classification and error balancing was developed and tested on a variety of sample datasets (Quickbird, IKONOS, Geoeye-1 aerial photographs) of four sites in the northern hemisphere recently affected by landslides (Haiti, Italy, China, France). Besides object metrics, such as band ratios and slope, newly introduced topographically-guided texture measures were found to enhance significantly the classification, and also feature selection revealed positive influence on the overall performance. With an iterative procedure to examine the class-imbalance within the training sample it was furthermore possible to compensate spurious effects of class-imbalance and class-overlap on the balance of the error rates. Employing approximately 20% of the data for training, the proposed workflow resulted in accuracies between 73% and 87% for the affected areas, and approximately balanced commission and omission errors.

AB Urban areas concentrate people, economic activity, and the built environment. As such, urbanization is simultaneously a demographic, economic, and land-use change phenomenon. Historically, the remote sensing community has used optical remote sensing data to map urban areas and the expansion of urban land-cover for individual cities, with little research focused on regional and global scale patterns of urban change. However, recent research indicates that urbanization at regional scales is growing in importance for economics, policy, land use planning, and conservation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand and monitor urbanization dynamics at regional and global scales. Here, we illustrate the use of multi-temporal nighttime light (NTL) data from the U.S Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellites Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) to monitor urban change at regional and global scales. We use independently derived data on population, land use and land cover to test the ability of multi-temporal NTL data to measure regional and global urban growth over time. We apply an iterative unsupervised classification method on multi-temporal NTL data from 1992 to 2008 to map urbanization dynamics in India, China, Japan, and the United States. For two-year intervals between 1992 and 2000, India consistently experienced higher rates of urban growth than China, and both countries exceeded the urban growth rates of the United States and Japan. This is not surprising given that the populations of India and China were growing faster than those of the U.S. and Japan during those periods. For two-year intervals between 2000 and 2008, China experienced higher rates of urban growth than India. Results show that the multi-temporal NTL provides a regional and potentially global measure of the spatial and temporal changes in urbanization dynamics for countries at certain levels of GDP and population-driven growth.

AB The use of satellites to monitor the color of the ocean requires effective removal of the atmospheric signal. This can be performed by extrapolating the aerosol optical properties in the visible from the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region assuming that the seawater is totally absorbant in this latter part of the spectrum. However, the non-negligible water-leaving radiance in the NIR which is characteristic of turbid waters may lead to an overestimate of the atmospheric radiance in the whole visible spectrum with increasing severity at shorter wavelengths. This may result in significant errors, if not complete failure, of various algorithms for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration, inherent optical properties and biogeochemical parameters of surface waters.
   This paper presents results of an inter-comparison study of three methods that compensate for NIR water-leaving radiances and that are based on very different hypothesis: 1) the standard Sea WiFS algorithm (Stumpfet al., 2003; Bailey et al., 2010) based on a bio-optical model and an iterative process; 2) the algorithm developed by Ruddick et al. (2000) based on the spatial homogeneity of the NIR ratios of the aerosol and water-leaving radiances; and 3) the algorithm of Kuchinke et al. (2009) based on a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean spectral optimization inversion. They are compared using normalized water-leaving radiance nL(w) in the visible. The reference source for comparison is ground-based measurements from three AERONET-Ocean Color sites, one in the Adriatic Sea and two in the East Coast of USA.
   Based on the matchup exercise, the best overall estimates of the nL(w) are obtained with the latest SeaWiFS standard algorithm version with relative error varying from 14.97% to 35.27% for lambda = 490 nm and lambda = 670 nm respectively. The least accurate estimates are given by the algorithm of Ruddick, the relative errors being between 16.36% and 42.92% for lambda = 490 nm and lambda = 412 nm, respectively. The algorithm of Kuchinke appears to be the most accurate algorithm at 412 nm (30.02%), 510 (15.54%) and 670 nm (32.32%) using its default optimization and bio-optical model coefficient settings.
   Similar conclusions are obtained for the aerosol optical properties (aerosol optical thickness tau(865) and the Angstrom exponent, alpha(510, 865)). Those parameters are retrieved more accurately with the SeaWiFS standard algorithm (relative error of 33% and 54.15% for tau(865) and alpha(510, 865)).
   A detailed analysis of the hypotheses of the methods is given for explaining the differences between the algorithms. The determination of the aerosol parameters is critical for the algorithm of Ruddick et al. (2000) while the bio-optical model is critical for the algorithm of Stumpf et al. (2003) utilized in the standard SeaWiFS atmospheric correction and both aerosol and bio-optical model for the coupled atmospheric-ocean algorithm of Kuchinke. The Kuchinke algorithm presents model aerosol-size distributions that differ from real aerosol-size distribution pertaining to the measurements. In conclusion, the results show that for the given atmospheric and oceanic conditions of this study, the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction algorithm is most appropriate for estimating the marine and aerosol parameters in the given turbid waters regions.

AB One of the most important atmospheric composition products derived from the first EUMETSAT Meteorological Operational satellite (MetOp-A) is the total ozone column (TOC). For this purpose, MetOp-A has two instruments on board: the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) that retrieves the TOC data from the backscattered solar ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) radiance, and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) that uses the thermal infrared radiance to derive TOC data. This paper focuses on the simultaneous validation of the TOC data provided by these two MetOp-A instruments using the measurements recorded by five well-calibrated Brewer UV spectrophotometers located at the Iberian Peninsula during the complete 2009. The results show an excellent correlation between the ground-based data and the GOME-2 and IASI satellite observations (R-2 higher than 0.91). Differences between the ground-based and satellite TOC data show that the IASI instrument significantly overestimates the Brewer measurements (about 4.4% when all five ground-based stations are jointly used). In contrast, the GOME-2 instrument shows a slight underestimation (similar to 1.6%). In addition, the absolute relative differences between the Brewer and GOME-2 data are quite smaller (about a factor higher than 2) than the Brewer-IASI absolute differences. The satellite viewing geometry (solar zenith angle and the view zenith angle) has no significant influence on the Brewer-satellite relative differences. Moreover, the analysis of these relative differences with respect to the ground-based TOC data indicates that GOME-2 instrument presents a slight underestimation for high TOC values. Finally, the IASI-GOME-2 correlation is high (R-2 similar to 0.92), but with a mean relative difference of about +/- 6% which could be associated with the bias between UV-Vis and infrared spectroscopy used in the retrieval processes.

AB We can use soil mapping to gain a better understanding of the soil and how it varies in the landscape. Good quality data sets that represent the survey area are important to develop quantitative spatial models for soil mapping and to evaluate their outputs. Over the past three decades, scientists have become interested in rapid, non-destructive measurements of the soil using visible-near infrared (vis-NIR) (400-2500 nm) and mid infrared (mid-IR) (2500-25,000 nm) diffuse reflectance spectra. These spectra provide an integrative technique that measures the fundamental characteristics and composition of the soil, including colour, iron oxide, clay and carbonate mineralogy, organic matter content and composition, the amount of water present and particle size. If adequately summarised and exhaustively available over large areas, this information might be useful in situations where reliable, quantitative soil information is needed, such as agricultural, environmental and ecological modelling, or for digital soil mapping. The aims of this paper are to summarise the information content of vis-NIR spectra of Australian soils and to use a predictive spatial modelling approach to digitally map this information across Australia on a 3-arc second grid (around 90 m). We measured the spectra of 4606 surface soil samples from across Australia using a vis-NIR spectrometer. The soil information content of the spectra was summarised using a principal component analysis (PCA). We used model trees to derive statistical relationships between the scores of the PCA and 31 predictors that were readily available and we thought might best represent the factors of soil formation (climate, organisms, relief, parent material, time and the soil itself). The models were validated and subsequently used to produce digital maps of the information content of the spectra, as summarised by the PCA, with estimates of prediction error at 3-arc seconds pixel resolution. The most frequently used predictors at the continental scale were factors related to climate, parent material (and time), while at landscape and more local scales, they were factors related to relief, organisms and the soil. Finally, we use our maps for pedologic interpretations of the distribution of soils in Australia. Our results might be useful in situations requiring high-resolution, quantitative soil information e.g. in agricultural, environmental and ecologic modelling and for soil mapping and classification.

AB Canopy foliar biomass, defined as the product of leaf dry matter content and leaf area index, is an important measurement for global biogeochemical cycles. This study explores the potential for retrieving foliar biomass in green canopies using a spectral index, the Normalized Dry Matter Index (NDMI). This narrow-band index is based on absorption at the C-H bond stretch overtone and is correlated with leaf dry matter content in fresh green leaves. PROSPECT and SAIL model simulations suggest that the NDMI at the canopy scale is able to minimize the effects of leaf thickness and leaf water content and to maximize sensitivity to variation in canopy foliar biomass. The simulation outputs were analyzed with an ANOVA, and 87% of the variation in the NDMI is explained by leaf dry matter content. The NDMI was linearly related to foliar biomass (g cm(-2)) from model simulations (R-2=0.97). The NDMI calculated from spectral reflectances for one to four stacked leaves was also correlated with total leaf biomass (R-2=0.59). These results suggest that it may be possible to determine foliar biomass from airborne and satellite-borne imaging spectrometers, such as NASA's HyspIRI mission. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB The aim of this study was to estimate soil moisture from RADARSAT-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired over agricultural fields. The adopted approach is based on the combination of semi-empirical backscattering models, four RADARSAT-2 images and coincident ground measurements (soil moisture, soil surface roughness and vegetation characteristics) obtained near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada during the summer of 2008. The depolarization ratio (chi(v)), the co-polarized correlation coefficient (rho(vvhh)) and the ratio of the absolute value of cross polarization to crop height (Lambda(vh)) derived from RADARSAT-2 data were analyzed with respect to changes in soil surface roughness, crop height, soil moisture and vegetation water content. This sensitivity analysis allowed us to develop empirical relationships for soil surface roughness, crop height and crop water content estimation regardless of crop type. The latter were then used to correct the semi-empirical Water-Cloud model for soil surface roughness and vegetation effects in order to retrieve soil moisture data. The soil moisture retrieved algorithm is evaluated over mature crop fields (wheat, pea, lentil, and canola) using ground measurements. Results show average relative errors of 19%, 10%, 25.5% and 32% respectively for the retrieval of crop height, soil surface roughness, crop water content and soil moisture. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Air temperature can be estimated from remote sensing by combining information in thermal infrared and optical wavelengths. The empirical TVX algorithm is based on an estimated linear relationship between observed Land Surface Temperature (LST) and a Spectral Vegetation Index (NDVI). Air temperature is assumed to be equal to the LST corresponding to the effective full vegetation cover, and is found by extrapolating the line to a maximum value of NDVImax. The algorithm has been tested and reported in the literature previously. However, the effect of vegetation types and climates and the potential variation in NDVI of the effective full cover has not been subject for investigation. The present study proposes a novel methodology to estimate NDVImax that uses observed air temperature to calibrate the NDVImax for each vegetation type. To assess the validity of this methodology, we have compared the accuracy of estimates using the new NDVImax and the previous NDVImax that have been proposed in literature with MSG-SEVIRI images in Spain during the year 2005. In addition, a spatio-temporal assessment of residuals has been performed to evaluate the accuracy of retrievals in terms of daily and seasonal variation, land cover, landscape heterogeneity and topography. Results showed that the new calibrated NDVImax perform well, with a Mean Absolute Error ranging between 2.8 degrees C and 4 degrees C. In addition, vegetation-specific NDVImax improve the accuracy compared with a unique NDVImax. (C)2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using MODIS data and the AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (ASRVN), this work studies errors of MODIS atmospheric correction caused by the Lambertian approximation. On one hand, this approximation greatly simplifies the radiative transfer model, reduces the size of the look-up tables, and makes operational algorithm faster. On the other hand, uncompensated atmospheric scattering caused by Lambertian model systematically biases the results. For example, for a typical bowl-shaped bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), the derived reflectance is underestimated at high solar or view zenith angles, where BRDF is high, and is overestimated at low zenith angles where BRDF is low. The magnitude of biases grows with the amount of scattering in the atmosphere, i.e., at shorter wavelengths and at higher aerosol concentration. The slope of regression of lambertian surface reflectance vs. ASRVN bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) is about 0.85 in the red and 0.6 in the green bands. This error propagates into the MODIS BRDF/albedo algorithm, slightly reducing the magnitude of overall reflectance and anisotropy of BRDF. This results in a small negative bias of spectral surface albedo. An assessment for the GSFC (Greenbelt, USA) validation site shows the albedo reduction by 0.004 in the near infrared, 0.005 in the red, and 0.008 in the green MODIS bands. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB A prototype method was developed to update the US. Geological Survey (USGS) National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 to a nominal date of 2006. NLCD 2001 is widely used as a baseline for national land cover and impervious cover conditions. To enable the updating of this database in an optimal manner, methods are designed to be accomplished by individual Landsat scene. Using conservative change thresholds based on land cover classes, areas of change and no-change were segregated from change vectors calculated from normalized Landsat scenes from 2001 and 2006. By sampling from NLCD 2001 impervious surface in unchanged areas, impervious surface predictions were estimated for changed areas within an urban extent defined by a companion land cover classification. Methods were developed and tested for national application across six study sites containing a variety of urban impervious surface. Results show the vast majority of impervious surface change associated with urban development was captured, with overall RMSE from 6.86 to 13.12% for these areas. Changes of urban development density were also evaluated by characterizing the categories of change by percentile for impervious surface. This prototype method provides a relatively low cost, flexible approach to generate updated impervious surface using NLCD 2001 as the baseline. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Greenhouse gas inventories and emissions reduction programs require robust methods to quantify carbon sequestration in forests. We compare forest carbon estimates from Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) data and QuickBird high-resolution satellite images, calibrated and validated by field measurements of individual trees. We conducted the tests at two sites in California: (1) 59 km(2) of secondary and old-growth coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) forest (Garcia-Mailliard area) and (2) 58 km(2) of old-growth Sierra Nevada forest (North Yuba area). Regression of aboveground live tree carbon density, calculated from field measurements, against Lidar height metrics and against QuickBird-derived tree crown diameter generated equations of carbon density as a function of the remote sensing parameters. Employing Monte Carlo methods, we quantified uncertainties of forest carbon estimates from uncertainties in field measurements, remote sensing accuracy, biomass regression equations, and spatial autocorrelation. Validation of QuickBird crown diameters against field measurements of the same trees showed significant correlation (r=0.82, P<0.05). Comparison of stand-level Lidar height metrics with field-derived Lorey's mean height showed significant correlation (Garcia-Mailliard r=0.94, P<0.0001: North Yuba R=0.89, P<0.0001). Field measurements of five aboveground carbon pools (live trees, dead trees, shrubs, coarse woody debris, and litter) yielded aboveground carbon densities (mean +/- standard error without Monte Carlo) as high as 320 +/- 35 Mg ha(-1) (old-growth coast redwood) and 510 +/- 120 Mg ha(-1) (red fir [Abies magnifica] forest), as great or greater than tropical rainforest. Lidar and QuickBird detected aboveground carbon in live trees, 70-97% of the total. Large sample sizes in the Monte Carlo analyses of remote sensing data generated low estimates of uncertainty. Lidar showed lower uncertainty and higher accuracy than QuickBird, due to high correlation of biomass to height and undercounting of trees by the crown detection algorithm. Lidar achieved uncertainties of <1%, providing estimates of aboveground live tree carbon density (mean +/- 95% confidence interval with Monte Carlo) of 82 +/- 0.7 Mg ha(-1) in Garda-Mailliard and 140 +/- 0.9 Mg ha(-1) in North Yuba. The method that we tested, combining field measurements, Lidar, and Monte Carlo, can produce robust wall-to-wall spatial data on forest carbon. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Estimates of forest area are among the most common and useful information provided by national forest inventories. The estimates are used for local and national purposes and for reporting to international agreements such as the Montreal Process, the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, and the Kyoto Protocol. The estimates are usually based on sample plot data and are calculated using probability-based estimators. These estimators are familiar, generally unbiased, and entail only limited computational complexity, but they do not produce the maps that users are increasingly requesting, and they generally do not produce sufficiently precise estimates for small areas. Model-based estimators overcome these disadvantages, but they may be biased and estimation of variances may be computationally intensive. The study objective was to compare probability- and model-based estimators of mean proportion forest using maps based on a logistic regression model, forest inventory data, and Landsat imagery. For model-based estimators, methods for evaluating bias and reducing the computational intensity were also investigated. Four conclusions were drawn: the logistic regression model exhibited no serious lack of fit to the data; all the estimators produced comparable estimates for mean proportion forest, except for small areas; probability-based inferences enhanced using maps produced increased precision: and the computational intensity associated with estimating variances for model-based estimators can be greatly reduced with no detrimental effects.

AB Biomass fractions (total aboveground, branches and foliage) were estimated from a small footprint discrete-return LiDAR system in an unmanaged Mediterranean forest in central Spain. Several biomass estimation models based on LiDAR height, intensity or height combined with intensity data were explored. Raw intensity data were normalized to a standard range in order to remove the range dependence of the intensity signal. In general terms, intensity-based models provided more accurate predictions of the biomass fractions. Height models selected were mainly based on a percentile of the height distribution. Intensity models selected included variables that consider the percentage of the intensity accumulated at different height percentiles, which implicitly take into account the height distribution. The general models derived considering all species together were based on height combined with intensity data. These models yielded R-2 values greater than 0.58 for the different biomass fractions considered and RMSE values of 28.89, 18.28 and 1.51 Mg ha(-1) for aboveground, branch and foliage biomass, respectively. Results greatly improved for species-specific models using the main species present in each plot, with R-2 values greater than 0.85, 0.70 and 0.90 for black pine, Spanish juniper and Holm oak, respectively, and with lower RMSE for the biomass fractions. Reductions in WAR point density had only a small effect on the results obtained, except for those models based on a variation of the Canopy Reflection Sum, which was weighted by the mean point density. Based on the species-specific equations derived, Holm oak dominated plots showed the highest average carbon contained by aboveground biomass and branch biomass 44.66 and 31.42 Mg ha(-1) respectively, while for foliage biomass carbon, Spanish juniper showed the highest average value (3.04 Mg ha(-1)).

AB In this effort, the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Collection V005) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/Albedo algorithm is used to retrieve instantaneous surface albedo at a point in time and under specific atmospheric conditions. These retrievals are then used to study the role that the fraction of diffuse skylight plays under realistic scenarios of anisotropic diffuse illumination and multiple scattering between the surface and atmosphere. Simulations of the sky radiance using the MODTRAN (R) 5.1 radiative transfer model were performed under different aerosol optical properties, illumination conditions, and surface characteristics to describe these effects on surface albedo retrievals from MODIS. This technique was examined using a validation scheme over four measurement sites with varied aerosol levels and landscapes, ranging from croplands to tundra ecosystems, and over extended time periods. Furthermore, a series of geostatistical analyses were performed to examine the types of spatial patterns observed at each measurement site. In particular, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) retrievals of surface albedo were acquired to analyze the change in variogram model parameters as a function of increased window-size. Results were then used to assess the degree to which a given point measurement is able to capture the intrinsic variability at the scale of MODIS observations. Assessments of MODIS instantaneous albedos that account for anisotropic multiple scattering, over snow-free and snow-covered lands and at all diurnal solar zenith angles, show a slight improvement over the albedo formulations that treat the downwelling diffuse radiation as isotropic. Comparisons with field measurements show biases improving by 0.004-0.013 absolute units (root-mean-squared error) or 0.1%-2.0% relative error. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A semi-empirical model is developed to predict the hourly concentration of ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) coincident to satellite overpass, at a regional scale. The model corrects the aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) by the assimilated parameters characterizing the boundary layer and further adjusts the corrected value according to meteorological conditions near the ground. The model was built and validated using the data collected for southern Ontario, Canada for 2004. Overall, the model is able to explain 65% of the variability in ground-level PM2.5 concentration. The model-predicted values of PM2.5 mass concentration are highly correlated with the actual observations. The root-mean-square error of the model is 6.1 mu g/m(3). The incorporation of ground-level temperature and relative humidity is found to be significant in improving the model predictability. The coarse resolution of the assimilated meteorological fields limits their value in the AOD correction. Although MODIS AOD data is acquired on a daily basis and the valid data coverage can sometimes be very limited due to unfavourable weather conditions, the model provides a cost-effective approach for obtaining supplemental PM2.5 concentration information in addition to the ground-based monitoring station measurement (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB This research analyses upward long-wave radiation flux density from urban surfaces using a high-resolution thermal-infrared (TIR) camera and meteorological measurements in the city of Berlin, Germany. We report spatio-temporal patterns of the difference between upward long-wave radiation flux density from courtyard surfaces and the roof. For temporal analysis, the TIR camera recorded one TIR image per minute over a period of two days from 3rd to 5th May 2007. Three-hourly averaged thermal patterns show persistence effects due to shadow, sky-view factor (SVF) distribution in the courtyard, thermal properties of the surface materials, human activities and turbulence characteristics of the surface-atmosphere interface. The history of shadow influences the 24-hourly mean pattern. Shadow caused by temporarily parked cars results in a lower upward long-wave radiation flux density compared to the non-shadowed surface close to it. Immediately after car departure, this difference decreases. We propose a method to derive the thermal admittance of a concrete surface based on TIR data from this attenuation process. This study shows that ground-based high-resolution TIR imagery is highly suitable to investigate surface thermal properties and dynamic processes controlling thermal patterns within a complex three-dimensional (3D) urban structure.

AB Savanna covers about two-thirds of Africa, with forage quantity and quality being important factors determining the distribution and density of wildlife and domestic stock. Testing hypotheses about the distribution of herbivores is hampered by the absence of reliable methods for measuring the variability of vegetation quality (e.g. biochemical composition) across the landscape. It is demonstrated that hyperspectral remote sensing fills this gap by revealing simultaneously the spatial variation of foliar nitrogen (crude protein) as well as the total amount of polyphenols, in grasses and trees. For the first time, the pattern of resources important for feeding preferences in herbivores (polyphenols and nitrogen) is mapped across an extensive landscape and the modeled foliar concentrations are shown to fit with ecological knowledge of the area. We explain how estimates of nitrogen (crude protein) and polyphenols may be scaled up from point-based observations to reveal their spatial pattern, and how the variation in forage quality can influence the management of savannas, including farms, communal grazing areas, and conservation areas. It provides a glimpse of the choices herbivores must face in selecting food resources of different qualities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Driven by a constantly accelerating increase of urban population in recent decades urban sprawl has become one of the most dynamic processes in the context of global land use transformations. The expansion of urban agglomerations is closely associated with a substantial increase of impervious surface. In Europe, methods for an accurate, fast and cost-effective mapping and assessment of impervious surface on a state-wide or national scale have not been established so far. This study presents an approach for estimating the impervious surface based on a combined analysis of single-date Landsat images and road network and railway vector data using Support Vector Machines and functionalities of geographic information processing. The modeling aims at the provision of data on the impervious surface for the total of residential, industrial and transportation-related areas. The derived information is provided for the administrative units of communities. The output of the procedure is a vector data file providing the 'percent impervious surface of built-up areas' (PISB) and the 'percent impervious surface of the total of built-up and transportation-related areas' (PISBT) for the administrative units of communities. The developed method is tested for a study area covering almost one third of the German territory. The results prove the suitability of the approach for a widely automated and area-wide mapping of impervious surfaces. Using reference data sets of three cities (Leipzig, Ludwigshafen, Passau) we realized a mean absolute error of 19.8% and an average error of 6.4% for the percent impervious surface modeled on the basis of the Landsat images. The final product resulting from a combination of the imperviousness raster derived from the satellite images with the transportation-related vector information showed a mean difference of 1% to 4% compared to corresponding reference data and results of previous studies. For the year 2000 our research shows that 45.3% of the area occupied by settlements and transport infrastructure in the German federal state of Bavaria, 44.6% in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg and 42.6% in the state of Saxony was covered by impervious surface.

AB We explore the ability to enhance landscape fire detection and characterization by constructing a 'virtual' fire product from a synthesis of geostationary and polar orbiting satellite data. Active fire pixels detected by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were spatially and temporally collated across Africa between February 2004 and January 2005. Coincident fire pixels detected by SEVIRI and MODIS were used to populate an empirical database of frequency density (f-D) distributions of fire radiative power (FRP). Frequency density distributions of FRP measured by SEVIRI at 5.0 degrees grid cell resolution and 15-minute temporal resolution were then cross referenced in the database to a set of counterpart f-D distributions of FRP measured by MODIS. This procedure resulted in the first generation of a 'virtual' fire product that exhibits the full continental coverage and high temporal resolution of SEVIRI whilst quantifying fire pixel counts and FRP with accuracies approaching those of MODIS. Diurnal cycles extracted from the virtual fire product indicate that SEVIRI measures a greater proportion of the active fire pixels and FRP potentially detectable by MODIS during the day due to the increased prevalence and stronger radiant contribution of highly energetic fire pixels. On a daily basis (sample size n = 365) the peak magnitude in the diurnal cycle of the virtual FRP occurred within the same 15-minute timeslot as in the native SEVIRI fire product. Continental-scale ignition and extinction events, however, were detected on average 44 min earlier (standard deviation s.d. = 40 min) and 137 min later (s.d. = 92 min), respectively. It is anticipated that the methodology developed here can be used to cross-calibrate active fire products between a variety of different satellite platforms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB The successful launch of panchromatic WorldView-1 and the planned launch of WorldView-2 will make a major contribution towards the advancement of the commercial remote sensing industry by providing improved capabilities, more frequent revisits and greater imaging flexibility with respect to the precursor QuickBird satellite. Remote sensing data from panchromatic systems have a potential for more detailed and accurate mapping of the urban environment with details of sub-meter ground resolution, but at the same time, they present additional complexities for information mining.
   In this study, very high-resolution panchromatic images from QuickBird and WorldView-1 have been used to accurately classify the land-use of four different urban environments: Las Vegas (U.S.A.), Rome (Italy), Washington D.C. (U.S.A.) and San Francisco (U.S.A.). The proposed method is based on the analysis of first- and second-order multi-scale textural features extracted from panchromatic data. For this purpose, textural parameters have been systematically investigated by computing the features over five different window sizes, three different directions and two different cell shifts for a total of 191 input features. Neural Network Pruning and saliency measurements made it possible to determine the most important textural features for sub-metric spatial resolution imagery of urban scenes.
   The results show that with a multi-scale approach it is possible to discriminate different asphalt surfaces, such as roads, highways and parking lots due to the different textural information content This approach also makes it possible to differentiate building architectures, sizes and heights, such as residential houses, apartment blocks and towers with classification accuracies above 0.90 in terms of Kappa coefficient computed over more than a million independent validation pixels.

AB MODIS, AVHRR and SPOT VEGETATION satellite images have recently been used to track coarse scale seasonal vegetation dynamics of boreal and temperate forests. However, the understanding of driving factors of reflectance seasonality at forest stand level is still in its infancy, and has only preliminarily been linked to, for example, forest structure or site fertility. We present results from a study on the seasonal reflectance trends of 145 hemiboreal birch stands in Estonia from budburst to initial senescence. A time series comprising 32 high resolution Landsat ETM+, TM and SPOT HRVIR, HRV images from April to September was assembled for analyzing empirical reflectance courses of birch stands. The most noteworthy seasonal reflectance dynamics were observed in the red and NIR channels, changes in the green and SWIR spectral channels were relatively small. The most stable period in stand reflectance in all the spectral channels occurred in midsummer i.e. when stand leaf area index (LAI) reached its highest level and changes in solar angle were the smallest. A twenty-day difference was observed between the reflectance development of birch stands growing on infertile and fertile sites. Next, to provide an explanation for the observed reflectance changes, we simulated the mean seasonal reflectance trajectories of the study stands at 10 day intervals for the same period using a radiative transfer model (FRT). Simulated seasonal reflectance courses for the different site fertility classes followed the general pattern of the measured courses. Simulation results indicated that the main driving factors for reflectance seasonality for all the site fertility classes in the red and green bands were stand LAI and leaf chlorophyll content, in the NIR band stand LAI, and in the SWIR band LAI and general water content. Finally, we discuss current limitations related to applying forest radiative transfer models in investigating the driving factors of seasonal reflectance changes in the boreal zone.

AB Canopy height distributions were created from small-footprint airborne laser scanner (ALS) data collected over 40 field sample plots with size 1000 m(2) located in mature conifer forest. ALS data were collected with two different instruments, i.e., the ALTM 1233 and ALTM 3100 laser scanners (Optech Inc.). The ALTM 1233 data were acquired at a flying altitude of 1200 m and a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 33 kHz. Three different acquisitions were carried out with ALTM 3100, i.e., (1) a flying altitude of 1100 m and a PRF of 50 kHz, (2) a flying altitude of 1100 m and a PRF of 100 kHz, and (3) a flying altitude of 2000 m and a PRF of 50 kHz. Height percentiles, mean and maximum height values, coefficients of variation of the heights, and canopy density at different height intervals above the ground were derived from the four different ALS datasets and for single + first and last echoes of the ALS data separately. The ALS-derived height- and density variables were assessed in pair-wise comparisons to evaluate the effects of (a) instrument, (b) flying altitude, and (c) PRF. A systematic shift in height values of up to 0.3 m between sensors when the first echoes were compared was demonstrated. Also the density-related variables differed significantly between the two instruments. Comparisons of flying altitudes and PRFs revealed upwards shifted canopy height distributions for the highest flying altitude (2000 m) and the lowest PRF (50 kHz). The distribution of echoes on different echo categories, i.e., single and multiple (first and last) echoes, differed significantly between acquisitions. The proportion of multiple echoes decreased with increasing flying altitude and PRF. Different echo categories have different properties since it is likely that single echoes tend to occur in the densest parts of the tree crowns, i.e., near the apex where the concentration of biological matter is highest and distance to the ground is largest. To assess the influence of instrument, flying altitude, and PRF on biophysical properties derived from ALS data, regression analysis was carried out to relate ALS-derived metrics to mean tree height (h(L)) and timber volume (V). Cross validation revealed only minor differences in precision for the different ALS acquisitions, but systematic differences between acquisitions of up to 2.5% for h(L) and 10.7% for V were found when comparing data from different acquisitions.

AB Robust yet simple remote sensing methodologies for mapping instantaneous land-surface fluxes of water, energy and CO2 exchange within a coupled framework add significant value to large-scale monitoring networks like FLUXNET, facilitating upscaling of tower flux observations to address questions of regional carbon cycling and water availability. This study investigates the implementation of an analytical, light-use efficiency (WE) based model of canopy resistance within a Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) scheme driven primarily by thermal remote sensing inputs. The WE model computes coupled canopy-scale carbon assimilation and transpiration fluxes, and replaces a Priestley-Taylor (PT) based transpiration estimate used in the original form of the TSEB model. In turn, the thermal remote sensing data provide valuable diagnostic information about the sub-surface moisture status, obviating the need for precipitation input data and prognostic modeling of the soil water balance. Both the WE and PT forms of the model are compared with eddy covariance tower measurements acquired in rangeland near El Reno, OK. The WE method resulted in improved partitioning of the surface energy budget, capturing effects of midday stomatal closure in response to increased vapor pressure deficit and reducing errors in half-hourly flux predictions from 16 to 12%. The spatial distribution of CO2 flux was mapped over the El Reno study area using data from an airborne thermal imaging system and compared to fluxes measured by an aircraft flying a transect over rangeland, riparian areas, and harvested winter wheat. Soil respiration contributions to the net carbon flux were modeled spatially using remotely sensed estimates of soil surface temperature, soil moisture, and leaf area index. Modeled carbon and water fluxes from this heterogeneous landscape compared well in magnitude and spatial pattern to the aircraft fluxes. The thermal inputs proved to be valuable in modifying the effective WE from a nominal species-dependent value. The model associates cooler canopy temperatures with enhanced transpiration, indicating higher canopy conductance and carbon assimilation rates. The surface energy balance constraint in this modeling approach provides a useful and physically intuitive mechanism for incorporating subtle signatures of soil moisture deficiencies and reduced stomatal aperture, manifest in the thermal band signal, into the coupled carbon and water flux estimates.

AB There is a need to develop operational land degradation indicators for large regions to prevent losses of biological and economic productivity. Disturbance events press ecosystems beyond resilience and modify the associated hydrological and Surface energy balance. Therefore, new indicators for water-limited ecosystems can be based on the partition of the Surface energy into latent (lambda E) and sensible heat flux (H).
   In this Study, a new methodology for monitoring land degradation risk for regional scale application is evaluated in a semiarid area of SE Spain. Input data include ASTER surface temperature and reflectance products, and other ancillary data. The methodology employs two land degradation indicators, one related to ecosystem water use derived from the non-evaporative fraction (NEF=H/(lambda E+H)), and another related to vegetation greenness derived front the NDVI. The surface energy modeling approach used to estimate the NEF showed errors within the range of similar Studies (R-2=0.88; RMSE=0.18 (22%)).
   To create quantitative indicators suitable for regional analysis, the NEF and NDVI were standardized between two possible extremes of ecosystem status: extremely disturbed and undisturbed in each climatic region to define the NEFS (NEF Standardized) and NDVIS (NDVI Standardized). The procedure Was Successful, as it statistically identified ecosystem status extremes for both indicators without supervision. Evaluation of the indicators at disturbed and undisturbed (control) sites, and intermediate Surface variables such as albedo or surface temperature, provided insights on the main Surface energy Status controls following disturbance events. These results suggest that ecosystem functional indicators, such as the NEFS, can provide information related to the surface water deficit, including the role of soil properties.

AB Nabesna Glacier is one of the longest land-terminus Mountain glaciers in North America. However, its now has never been Studied. We derived detailed motion patterns of Nabesna Glacier in winter and spring 19941996 front the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the European Remote Sensing satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2) using interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques. Special effort was made to assess the accuracy of the motion estimates, and remove data points with high uncertainty from the motion profiles, enabling Lis to obtain reliable glacier flow patterns along the highly curved main Course of Nabesna Glacier. The results, covering 80 km of the 87 kin main Course of the glacier, were used to delineate four distinctive sections in terms of spatial and temporal variability of the glacier speed: (1) the upper section where glacier How was apparently random both temporally and spatially presumably due to development of crevasses; (2) the upper-middle section with relatively steady flow around 0.27 to 0.4 m/day; (3) the middle section with a stable pattern of acceleration from 0.27-0.3 m/day to the maximum about 0.67-0.73 m/day, followed by a general deceleration to 0.17-0.33 m/day before reaching (4) the lower section where the glacier motion was generally slow yet highly variable although uncertainty in the estimation is high. Occurrence of the flow maximum, as well as many local maxima and minima at consistent locations over different periods Suggests that the valley geometry affect the overall flow pattern. On top of this general trend, many small-scale temporal/spatial variations in the glacier flow patterns were observed along the glacier, especially in the lower sections. On average, the flow speeds were in the range of 0.3 to 0.7 m/day: however this lacks any measurements of summer flow speeds which are expected to be significantly higher. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB A growing number of investigations have shown that remote sensing of foliar nitrogen (N) concentration in plant canopies can be achieved with imaging spectroscopy, or hyperspectral remote sensing, from satellite or airborne sensors. Development of this approach has been fueled by recognition that foliar N is related to a variety of ecological and biogeochemical processes, ranging from the spread of invasive species to the ecosystem effects of insect defoliation events to patterns of N cycling in forest soils. To date, most studies have focused on building site-specific foliar N detection algorithms applied to individual scenes or small landscapes that have been intensively characterized with local field Measurements. However, tire growing number of well-measured sites, combined with improvements in image data quality and processing methods provide all opportunity to begin seeking more general N detection methods that can be applied to a broader range of sites or to locations that lack intensive field measurements.
   Here, we combine data from several independent efforts in North America, Central America and Australia, to examine whether development of calibration methods to determine canopy nitrogen concentration across a wide range of forest ecosystems is possible. The analysis included data from 137 individual field plots within eight study sites for which imagery has been acquired from NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and/or Hyperion instruments. The combined dataset was used to evaluate site-specific calibration results as well as results obtained with data pooled across all sites. We evaluated the accuracy of results using plot- and site-level cross-validation wherein individual plots or entire sites were withheld and used as air independent validation of the resulting algorithms. In instances where all sites were represented in the calibration, canopy-level foliar N concentration was predicted to within 7-15% of the mean field-measured values indicating a strong potential for broadly applied foliar N detection. When whole sites were iteratively dropped from the calibration and predicted by remaining data, predictions were still significant, but less accurate (7-47% of mean canopy-level N concentration). This suggests that further development to include a wider range of ecosystems will be necessary before cross-site prediction accuracy approaches that seen in site-specific calibrations. Nevertheless, we view these results as promising, particularly given the potential value of foliar N estimates, even at a reduced level of confidence, at sites for which there is no possibility of conducting field data collections.

AB A semi-physical fusion approach that uses the MODIS BRDF/Albedo land surface characterization product and Landsat ETM+ data to predict ETM+ reflectance on the same, an antecedent, or subsequent date is presented. The method may be used for ETM+ cloud/cloud shadow and SLC-off gap filling and for relative radiometric normalization. It is demonstrated over three study sites, one in Africa and two in the U.S. (Oregon and Idaho) that were selected to encompass a range of land cover land use types and temporal variations in solar illumination, land cover, land use, and phenology. Specifically, the 30 m ETM+ spectral reflectance is predicted for a desired date as the product of observed ETM+ reflectance and the ratio of the 500 m surface reflectance modeled using the MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters and the sun-sensor geometry on the predicted and observed Landsat dates. The difference between the predicted and observed ETM+ reflectance (prediction residual) is compared with the difference between the ETM+ reflectance observed on the two dates (temporal residual) and with respect to the MODIS BRDF model parameter quality. For all three scenes, and all but the shortest wavelength band, the mean prediction residual is smaller than the mean temporal residual, by up to a factor of three. The accuracy is typically higher at ETM+ pixel locations where the MODIS BRDF model parameters are derived using the best quality inversions. The method is most accurate for the ETM+ near-infrared (NIR) band; mean NIR prediction residuals are 9%,12% and 14% of the mean NIR scene reflectance of the African, Oregon and Idaho sites respectively. The developed fusion approach may be applied to any high spatial resolution satellite data, does not require any tuning parameters and so may be automated, is applied on a per-pixel basis and is unaffected by the presence of missing or contaminated neighboring Landsat pixels, accommodates for temporal variations due to surface changes (e.g., phenological, land cover/land use variations) observable at the 500 m MODIS BRDF/Albedo product resolution, and allows for future improvements through BRDF model refinement and error assessment.

AB MODIS active fire data offer new information about global fire patterns. However, uncertainties in detection rates can render satellite-derived fire statistics difficult to interpret. We evaluated the MODIS I km daily active fire product to quantify detection rates for both Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors, examined how cloud cover and fire size affected detection rates, and estimated how detection rates varied across the United States. MODIS active fire detections were compared to 361 reference fires (>= 18 ha) that had been delineated using pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery. Reference fires were considered detected. if at least one MODIS active fire pixel occurred within I km of the edge of the fire. When active fire data from both Aqua and Terra were combined, 82% of all reference fires were found, but detection rates were less for Aqua and Terra individually (73% and 66% respectively). Fires not detected generally had more cloudy days, but not when the Aqua data were considered exclusively. MODIS detection rates decreased with fire size, and the size at which 50% of all fires were detected was 105 ha when combining Aqua and Terra (195 ha for Aqua and 334 ha for Terra alone). Across the United States, detection rates were greatest in the West, lower in the Great Plains, and lowest in the East. The MODIS active fire product captures large fires in the U.S. well, but may under-represent fires in areas with frequent cloud cover or rapidly burning, small, and low-intensity fires. We recommend that users of the MODIS active fire data perform individual validations to ensure that all relevant fires are included. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study we implemented a comprehensive analysis to validate the MODIS and GOES satellite active fire detection products (MOD 14 and WFABBA, respectively) and characterize their major sources of omission and commission errors which have important implications for a large community of fire data users. Our analyses were primarily based on the use of 30 m resolution ASTER and ETM+ imagery as our validation data. We found that at the 50% true positive detection probability mark, WFABBA requires four times more active fire area than is necessary for MOD14 to achieve the same probability of detection, despite the 16x factor separating the nominal spatial resolutions of the two products. Approximately 75% and 95% of all fires sampled were omitted by the MOD14 and WFABBA instantaneous products, respectively; whereas an omission error of 38% was obtained for WFABBA when considering the 30-minute interval of the GOES data. Commission errors for MOD] 4 and WFABBA were found to be similar and highly dependent on the vegetation conditions of the areas imaged, with the larger commission errors (approximately 35%) estimated over regions of active deforestation. Nonetheless, the vast majority (>80%) of the commission errors were indeed associated with recent burning activity where scars could be visually confirmed in the higher resolution data. Differences in thermal dynamics of vegetated and non-vegetated areas were found to produce a reduction of approximately 50% in the commission errors estimated towards the hours of maximum fire activity (i.e., early-afternoon hours) which coincided with the MODIS/Aqua overpass. Lastly, we demonstrate the potential use of temporal metrics applied to the mid-infrared bands of MODIS and GOES data to reduce the commission errors found with the validation analyses.

AB Multispectral thermal infrared remote sensing of surface emissivities can detect and monitor long term land vegetation cover changes over arid regions. The technique is based on the link between spectral emissivities within the 8.5-9.5 mu m interval and density of sparsely covered terrains. The link exists regardless of plant color, which means that it is often possible to distinguish bare soils from senescent and non-green vegetation. This capability is typically not feasible with vegetation indices. The method is demonstrated and verified using ASTER remote sensing observations between 2001 and 2003 over the Jornada Experimental Range, a semi-arid site in southern New Mexico, USA. A compilation of 27 nearly cloud-free, multispectral thermal infrared scenes revealed spatially coherent patterns of spectral emissivities decreasing at rates on the order of 3% per year with R-2 values of similar to 0.82. These patterns are interpreted as regions of decreased vegetation densities, a view supported by ground-based leaf area index transect data. The multi-year trend revealed by ASTER's 90-m resolution data are independently confirmed by 1-km data from Terra MODIS. Comparable NDVI images do not detect the long-term spatially coherent changes in vegetation. These results show that multispectral thermal infrared data, used in conjunction with visible and near infrared data, could be particularly valuable for monitoring land cover changes.

AB Data assimilation - the set of techniques whereby information from observing systems and models is combined optimally - is rapidly becoming prominent in endeavours to exploit Earth Observation for Earth sciences, including climate prediction. This paper explains the broad principles of data assimilation, outlining different approaches (optimal interpolation, three-dimensional and four-dimensional variational methods, the Kalman Filter), together with the approximations that are often necessary to make them practicable. After pointing out a variety of benefits of data assimilation, the paper then outlines some practical applications of the exploitation of Earth Observation by data assimilation in the areas of operational oceanography, chemical weather forecasting and carbon cycle modelling. Finally, some challenges for the future are noted. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Arctic vegetation distribution is largely controlled by climate, particularly summer temperatures. Summer temperatures have been increasing in the Arctic and this trend is expected to continue. Arctic vegetation has been shown to change in response to increases in summer temperatures, which in turn affects arctic fauna, human communities and industries. An understanding of the relationship of existing plant communities to temperature is important in order to monitor change effectively. In addition, variation along existing climate gradients can help predict where and how vegetation changes may occur as climate warming continues. In this study we described the spatial relationship between satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST), circumpolar arctic vegetation, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). LST, mapped as summer warmth index (SWI), accurately portrayed temperature gradients due to latitude, elevation and distance from the coast. The SWI maps also reflected NDVI patterns, though NDVI patterns were more complex due to the effects of lakes, different substrates and different-aged glacial surfaces. We found that for the whole Arctic, a 5 degrees C increase in SWI along the climate gradient corresponded to an increase in NDVI of approximately 0.07. This result supports and is of similar magnitude as temporal studies showing increases of arctic NDVI corresponding to increases in growing season temperatures over the length of the satellite record. The strongest positive relationship between NDVI and SWI occurred in partially vegetated and graminoid vegetation types. Recently deglaciated areas, areas with many water bodies, carbonate soil areas, and high mountains had lower NDVI values than predicted by SWI. Plant growth in these areas was limited by substrate factors as well as temperature, and thus is likely to respond less to climate warming than other areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Ensemble Kalman filter is a new sequential data assimilation algorithm which was originally developed for atmospheric and oceanographic data assimilation. It can be applied to calculate error covariance matrix through Monte-Carlo simulation. This approach is able to resolve the nonlinearity and discontinuity existed within model operator and observation operator. When observation data are assimilated at each time step, error covariances are estimated from the phase-space distribution of an ensemble of model states. The error statistics is then used to calculate Kalman gain matrix and analysis increments. In this study, we develop a one-dimensional soil moisture data assimilation system based on ensemble Kalman filter, the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB2) and microwave radiation transfer model (AIEM, advanced integration equation model). We conduct numerical experiments to assimilate in situ soil surface moisture measurements and low-frequency passive microwave remote sensing data into a land surface model, respectively. The results indicate that data assimilation can significantly improve the soil surface moisture estimation. The improvement in root zone is related to the model bias errors at surface layer and root zone. The soil moisture does not vary significantly in deep layer. Additionally, the ensemble Kalman filter is predominant in dealing with the nonlinearity of model operator and observation operator. It is practical and effective for assimilating observations in situ and remotely sensed data into land surface models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) have a significant advantage over previous datasets because of the combination of high spatial resolution (15-90 m) and enhanced multispectral capabilities, particularly in the thermal infrared (TIR) atmospheric window (8-12 mu m) of the Earth where common silicate minerals are more easily identified. However, the 60 kin swath width of ASTER can limit the effectiveness of accurately tracing large-scale features, such as eolian sediment transport pathways, over long distances. The primary goal of this paper is to describe a method for generating a seamless and radiometrically accurate ASTER TIR mosaic of atmospherically corrected radiance and from that, extract surface emissivity for and lands, specifically, sand seas. The Gran Desierto in northern Sonora, Mexico was used as a test location for the radiometric normalization technique because of past remote sensing studies of the region, its compositional diversity, and its size. A linear approach was taken to transform adjacent image swaths into a direct linear relationship between image acquisition dates. Pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) were selected using a threshold of correlation between radiance values, and change-pixels were excluded from the linear regression used to determine correction factors. The degree of spectral correlation between overlapping pixels is directly related to the amount of surface change over time; therefore, the gain and offsets between scenes were based only on regions of high spectral correlation. The result was a series of radiometrically normalized radiance-at-surface images that were combined with a minimum of image edge seams present. These edges were subsequently blended to create the final mosaic. The advantages of this approach for TIR radiance (as opposed to emissivity) data include the ability to: (1) analyze data acquired on different dates (with potentially very different surface temperatures) as one seamless compositional dataset; (2) perform decorrelation stretches (DCS) on the entire dataset in order to identify and discriminate compositional units; and (3) separate brightness temperature from surface emissivity for quantitative compositional analysis of the surface, reducing seam-line error in the emissivity mosaic. The approach presented here is valid for any ASTER-related study of large geographic regions where numerous images spanning different temporal and atmospheric conditions are encountered.

AB Reflectance data in the green, red and near-infrared wavelength region were acquired by the SPOT high resolution visible and geometric imaging instruments for an agricultural area in Denmark (56 degrees N, 9 degrees E) for the purpose of estimating leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab) and green leaf area index (LAI). SPOT reflectance observations were atmospherically corrected using aerosol data from MODIS and profiles of air temperature, humidity and ozone from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and used as input for the inversion of a canopy reflectance model. Computationally efficient inversion schemes were developed for the retrieval of soil and land cover-specific parameters which were used to build multiple species and site dependent formulations relating the two biophysical properties of interest to vegetation indices or single spectral band reflectances. Subsequently, the family of model generated relationships, each a function of soil background and canopy characteristics, was employed for a fast pixel-wise mapping of C-ab and LAI.
   The biophysical parameter retrieval scheme is completely automated and image-based and solves for the soil background reflectance signal, leaf mesophyll structure, specific dry matter content, Markov clumping characteristics, C-ab and LAI without utilizing calibration measurements.
   Despite the high vulnerability of near-infrared reflectances (rho(nir)) to variations in background properties, an efficient correction for background influences and a strong sensitivity of rho(nir) to LAI, caused LAI-rho(nir) relationships to be very useful and preferable over LAI-NDVI relationships for LAI prediction when LAI>2. Reflectances in the green waveband (rho(green)) were chosen for producing maps of C-ab.
   The application of LAI-NDVI, LAI-rho(nir) and C-ab-rho(green) relationships provided reliable quantitative estimates of C-ab and LAI for agricultural crops characterized by contrasting architectures and leaf biochemical constituents with overall root mean square deviations between estimates and in-situ measurements of 0.74 for LAI and 5.0 mu g cm(-2) for C-ab.
   The results of this study illustrate the non-uniqueness of spectral reflectance relationships and the potential of physically-based inverse and forward canopy reflectance modeling techniques for a reasonably fast and accurate retrieval of key biophysical parameters at regional scales.

AB Based on very high resolution satellite images, object-based classification methods can be used to produce large scale maps for forest management. These new products require a method to derive quantitative information about the accuracy and precision of delineated boundaries. This assessment would complement any measure of thematic accuracy derived from the confusion matrix. This study aims to assess the positional quality of the boundaries between different landscape units produced by automated segmentation of IKONOS and SPOT-5 satellite images over temperate forests. A robust method was developed to assess the accuracy and the precision of the forest boundaries, respectively measured by the bias and the standard deviation. The two main sources of positional error, namely residual parallax and automatic segmentation, were independently assessed. Positional errors caused by the residual parallax were quantified using a 3D model. Forest stand boundaries generated by automatic segmentation were compared to corresponding visual delineations. The results showed that residual parallax was the major source of positive bias (area overestimation) along forest/non-forest boundaries and depended on the interactions between forest stand patterns and sensor viewing angles. Due mainly to tree shade, the automatic segmentation also produced a positive bias on forest areas, which remained under I in for both IKONOS-2 and SPOT-5 images. Standard deviation did not increase linearly with pixel size and was influenced by the nature of the boundary. Production of 1:20,000 scale forest maps from very high resolution satellite data clearly requires acquisition of near nadir imagery or knowledge of landscape object height for true orthorectification. In these cases, IKONOS-2 segmentation outputs were found to correspond with 1:20,000 scale map specification, and SPOT-5 imagery with 1:30,000 scale. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To estimate the gross CO2 flux (F-CO2) of deciduous coniferous forest from canopy spectral reflectance, we introduced spectral vegetation indices (VIs) into a light use efficiency (LUE) model of mature Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi) forest. We measured the eddy covariance CO2 flux and spectral reflectance of larch canopy at half-hourly intervals during one growing season, and investigated the relationships between the parameters of the LUE model (FAPAR, epsilon) and 3 types of VIs (NDVI, PRI, EVI) in both clear sky and cloudy conditions.
   FAPAR (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) had a positive linear relationship with both NDVI (non-nalized difference vegetation index) and EVI (enhanced vegetation index), and the sky condition had little effect on the relationships. The relative RMSE (root mean square error) of the APAR (absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) based on the incoming PAR and estimated FAPAR from a linear function of NDVI was less than 10.5%, irrespective of sky condition.
   Half-hourly values of epsilon (conversion efficiency of absorbed energy) showed both seasonal variation related to leaf phenology and short-term variation related to light intensity due to varied sun position and sky condition. Both EVI and PRI (photochemical reflectance index) were significantly correlated with epsilon, EVI showed a positive linear relationship with epsilon as a result of their similar seasonal variation. However, since EVI did not detect short-term variation of epsilon, their relationship differed among sky conditions. On the other hand, although PRI could trace the shortterm variation of epsilon in green needles, the relationship became non-linear due to drastic reduction of PRI in the senescent needles.
   EVI/(PRI/PRImin), a combined index based on a 6-day moving minimum value of PRI (PRImin), showed a linear relationship with half-hourly values of epsilon throughout the seasons irrespective of sky condition. This index allow us to estimate epsilon in all sky conditions with a smaller error (rRMSE = 35.2%) than using EVI or PRI alone (38.7%-48.7%). Consequently, this combined index-derived epsilon and NDVI-based FAPAR gave a low estimation error of F-CO2, (rRMSE = 36.4%, RMSE = 8.3 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Although there are still various issues to resolve, including adaptive limit and combination of vegetation index type, we conclude that the combination of PRI and EVI increased the accuracy of estimation Of CO2 uptake in deciduous forest even though sky conditions varied.

AB Fires caused by natural or technological disasters emit large amounts of smoke which, once formed into plumes, may affect the human health and the environment. Satellite remote sensing data provide an effective tool to achieve detection and monitoring of these plumes over large areas on a routine basis. Discrimination of plumes on satellite images is a prerequisite to study and retrieve physical, chemical and optical properties of emitted smoke. An improved algorithm for the detection of plumes caused by natural or technological hazards using AVHRR imagery is presented in this study. The method is based on a multi-temporal and multi-spectral change detection algorithm. It is performed in two main steps: a) appropriate spectral and spatial filters are applied on the images acquired before and after a fire event in visible and near-infrared ranges in order to extract the core of the plume; b) a criterion on spectral information is defined as an homogeneity measure that enables, through a modified version of the region-growing method, the spatial expansion of the detected core to include the complete area covered by the plume. Through this approach, a pixel is identified as a plume pixel if it is "close" to the core plume pixels in both spatial and spectral spaces. The algorithm was developed and calibrated using AVHRR images acquired over Spain before and during a major forest fire event on July 16, 2005. It was applied using past events of natural and technological hazards in several locations to ensure its global applicability and robustness. The algorithm produced accurate results in all cases of plumes, either in natural or in technological fire events. Three application cases are presented in this study: A major fire in an industrial installation in London (December 11, 2005), a major fire in Baghdad during the recent war in Iraq (April 1, 2003) and a forest fire in California (September 29, 2005).

TI Repetitive interpolation: A robust algorithm for DTM generation from
   Aerial Laser Scanner Data in forested terrain
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article

ID AIRBORNE; FILTER
AB We present a new algorithm for digital terrain model (DTM) generation from an airborne laser scanning point cloud, called repetitive interpolation (REIN). It is especially applicable in steep, forested areas where other filtering algorithms typically have problems distinguishing between ground returns and off-ground points reflected in the vegetation. REIN can produce a DTM either in a vector grid or in a TIN data structure. REIN is applied after an initial filtering, which involves removal of all negative outliers and removal of many, but not necessarily all, off-ground points by some existing filtering algorithm. REIN makes use of the redundancy in the initially filtered point cloud (FPC) in order to mitigate the effect of the residual off-ground points. Multiple independent random samples are taken from the initial FPC. From each sample, ground elevation estimates are interpolated at individual DTM locations. Because the lower bounds of the distributions of the elevation estimates at each DTM location are almost insensitive to positive outliers, the true ground elevations can be approximated by adding the global mean offset to the lower bounds, which is estimated from the data. The random sampling makes REIN unique among the methods of filtering airborne laser data. While other filters behave deterministically, always generating a filter error in special situations, in REIN, because of its random aspects, these errors do not occur in each sample, and typically cancel out in the final computation of DTM elevations. Reduction of processing time by parallelization of REIN is possible. REIN was tested in a test area of 2 hectares, encompassing steep relief covered by mixed forest. An Optech ALTM 1020 lidar was used, with a flying height of 260-300 in above the ground, the beam divergence was 0.3 mrad, and the obtained point cloud density for the last returns was 8.5 m(-2). A DTM grid was generated with I in horizontal resolution. The root mean square elevation error of the DTM ranged between +/- 0.16 in and +/- 0.37 in, depending on REIN sampling rate and number of samples taken, the lowest value achieved with 4 samples and using a 23% sampling rate. The paper also gives a short overview on existing filtering algorithms. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB National and regional obligations to control and maintain water quality have led to an increase in coastal and estuarine monitoring. A potentially valuable tool is high temporal and spatial resolution satellite ocean colour data. NASA's MODIS-Terra and -Aqua can capture data at both 250 in and 500 in spatial resolutions and the existence of two sensors provides the possibility for multiple daily passes over a scene. However, no robust atmospheric correction method currently exists for these data, rendering them unusable for quantitative monitoring applications. Therefore, this paper presents an automatic and dynamic atmospheric correction approach allowing the determination of ocean colour. The algorithm is based around the standard MODIS 1 km atmospheric correction, includes cloud masking and is applicable to all of the visible 500 m bands. Comparison of the 500 m ocean colour data with the standard 1 km data shows good agreement and these results are further supported by in situ data comparisons. In addition, a novel method to produce 500 m chlorophyll-a estimates is presented. Comparisons of the 500 M estimates with the standard MODIS OC3M algorithm and to in situ data from a near-coast validation site are given. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The aim of this study is to evaluate a new neural network classifier using spectrally sampled image data to map mixed halophytic vegetation in tidal environments. The work is based on the concept of vegetation communities, mixtures of several species, characteristic of salt marshes. The study site is the Venice lagoon, and the material available is a spectrally sampled Compact Airborne Spectral Imager (CASI) image, in conjunction with ground truth for precise characterization of vegetation communities. Detailed observations of vegetation species and of their fractional abundance were collected for 36 Regions Of Interest (ROI): such field polygons are used for classification training and accuracy assessment. To select the most significant spectral channels, the Spectral Reconstruction method was applied to the image data: a set of 6 bands was selected as optimal for classification, out of the 15 available. The spatial heterogeneity of salt-marsh vegetation is significant and even at the spatial resolution of the airborne CASI image data, mixed pixels are observed. The Vegetation Community based Neural Network Classifier (VCNNC) is introduced to cope with a situation where no pure pixels exist, and was applied to the set of 6 selected bands. Both quantitative and qualitative comparisons of classification results of VCNNC with those of conventional Neural Network Classifier (NNC), trained and assessed on exactly the same data sets, shows that VCNNC's accuracy is substantially higher (approximate to 91%) than that of NNC (approximate to 84%), while the Kappa coefficient is 0.87 for VCNNC and 0.75 for the NNC method.

AB Using two general linear regression models, we compared the ability of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrieved by the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to predict ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in St. Louis, MO and its surrounding areas. The models included meteorological parameters obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Rapid Update Cycle (RUC20) model as covariates. Both MISR and MODIS AOT values were highly significant predictors Of PM2.5 concentrations. The MISR and MODIS models have overall comparable predictability of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. The MISR model explained a slightly greater percentage (62%) of the variability in PM2.5 concentrations than the MODIS model (51%), and thus was a better fit. Over the entire data range, the MISR model underpredicts PM2.5 concentrations by approximately 12%, whereas the MODIS model underpredicts PM2.5 concentrations by approximately 18%. This underestimation occurred primarily at higher PM2.5 concentrations in both models. The regression coefficients from two models were highly comparable, suggesting that combining MISR and MODIS AOT data might benefit from the higher predicting accuracy of MISR and the better spatial coverage of MODIS. The newly developed particle size/shape indicators in MISR and MODIS aerosol product did not significantly improve our ability to predict PM2.5 concentrations using AOT measurements. Finally, using hourly PM2.5 concentrations did not seem to improve its association with AOT for the current study region. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Surface emissivity estimation is a significant factor for the land surface temperature estimation from remotely sensed data. For fully vegetated surfaces, the emissivity estimation is performed in a simple manner since the emissivity is relatively uniform. However, for and land with sparse vegetation, the estimation is more complicated since the emissivity of the exposed soil and rock is highly variable. In this study, mean and difference emissivity for bands 31 and 32 of MODIS sensor have been derived based on NDVI values. First, the NDVI thresholds have been determined to separate bare soil, partially vegetated soil and fully vegetated land. Then regression relations have been derived to estimate mean and difference emissivity of the bare soil samples and partially vegetated surfaces. A constant emissivity is also used for fully vegetated area. Along with the correlations, standard deviations of the regression relations have been examined for a set of representative soil types. Standard deviations smaller than 0.003 in mean emissivity and smaller than 0.004 in difference emissivity are resulted in regression linear relations. Evaluation of the NDVI derived regression relations has been performed using the results of MODIS Day/Night Land Surface Temperature (LST) algorithm on a pair of MODIS images. Using around 45,500 pixels with different soil and land cover types, emissivity of each pixel in bands 31 and 32 have been estimated. The calculated emissivities have been compared with emissivities calculated by MODIS Day/Night LST algorithm. Biases and standard deviations of NDVI-based relations show relatively high agreement for mean and difference emissivity relations with Day/Night method results. It may be concluded that the proposed algorithm can be used as a rather simple alternative to complex emissivity-estimation algorithms. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of canopy spectral invariants expresses the observation that simple algebraic combinations of leaf and canopy spectral transmittance and reflectance become wavelength independent and determine a small set of canopy structure specific variables. This set includes the canopy interceptance, the recollision and the escape probabilities. These variables specify an accurate relationship between the spectral response of a vegetation canopy to the incident solar radiation at the leaf and the canopy scale and allow for a simple and accurate parameterization for the partitioning of the incoming radiation into canopy transmission, reflection and absorption at any wavelength in the solar spectrum. This paper presents a solid theoretical basis for spectral invariant relationships reported in literature with an emphasis on their accuracies in describing the shortwave radiative properties of the three-dimensional vegetation canopies. The analysis of data on leaf and canopy spectral transmittance and reflectance collected during the international field campaign in Flakaliden, Sweden, June 25-July 4, 2002 supports the proposed theory. The results presented here are essential to both modeling and remote sensing communities because they allow the separation of the structural and radiometric components of the measured/modeled signal. The canopy spectral invariants offer a simple and accurate parameterization for the shortwave radiation block in many global models of climate, hydrology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. In remote sensing applications, the information content of hyperspectral data can be fully exploited if the wavelength-independent variables can be retrieved, for they can be more directly related to structural characteristics of the three-dimensional vegetation canopy.

AB The Along-Track Scanning Radiometer 2 (ATSR2) instrument has a dual view capability that allows for stereo height retrievals. Stereo heights were retrieved for selected scenes over the United Kingdom Chilbolton Facility for Atmospheric and Radio Research and the United States Atmospheric Radiation Measurement program Southern Great Plains site from 1997 to 2000. Stereo cloud-top heights obtained with the 11 mu m and 1.6 mu m channels of ATSR2 were compared with ground-based millimeter-wave cloud radar measurements at both sites. On average ATSR2 11 mu m channel cloud-top height retrievals were 350 m higher than those from radar with a standard deviation of 1 km. This difference increased with decreasing cloud-top height. One major problem found in the 11 mu m channel cloud-top height retrievals was poor delineation between surface (i.e., clear) and low-altitude cloud pixels, though this tends to lower cloud-top heights rather than raise them. The ATSR2 1.6 mu m channel stereo cloud-top heights had large discrepancies compared to radar because of the 1.6 mu m channel sensitivity to a lower layer in the case of multilayer clouds or the terrain in the case of optically thin single-layer clouds. For single-layer clouds, the agreement between the ATSR2 1.6 mu m channel and the radar cloud-top heights was similar to that between ATSR2 11 mu m channel and radar cloud-top heights.

AB The design of the training stage of a supervised classification should account for the properties of the classifier to be used. Consideration of the way the classifier operates may enable the training stage to be designed in a manner which ensures that the aim of the classification is satisfied with the use of a small, inexpensive, training set. It may, therefore, be possible to reduce the training set size requirements from that generally expected with the use of standard heuristics. Substantial reductions in training set size may be possible if interest is focused on a single class. This is illustrated for mapping cotton in north-western India by support vector machine type classifiers. Four approaches to reducing training set size were used: intelligent selection of the most informative training samples, selective class exclusion, acceptance of imprecise descriptions for spectrally distinct classes and the adoption of a one-class classifier. All four approaches were able to reduce the training set size required considerably below that suggested by conventional widely used heuristics without significant impact on the accuracy with which the class of interest was classified. For example, reductions in training set size of similar to 90% from that suggested by a conventional heuristic are reported with the accuracy of cotton classification remaining nearly constant at similar to 95% and similar to 97% from the user's and producer's perspectives respectively.

AB We evaluate the potential of deriving fractional cover (fCover) and leaf area index (LAI) from discrete return, small footprint airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. fCover was computed as the fraction of laser vegetation hits over the number of total laser echoes per unit area. Analogous to the concept of contact frequency, an effective LAI proxy was estimated by a fraction of first and last echo types inside the canopy. Validation was carried out using 83 hemispherical photographs georeferenced to centimeter accuracy by differential GPS, for which the respective gap fractions were computed over a range of zenith angles using the Gap Light Analyzer (GLA). LAI was computed by GLA from gap fraction estimations at zenith angles of 0-60. For ALS data, different data trap sizes were used to compute fCover and LAI proxy, the range of radii was 2-25 m. For fCover, a data trap size of 2 m radius was used, whereas for LAI a radius of 15 m provided best results. fCover was estimated both from first and last echo data, with first echo data overestimating field fCover and last echo data underestimating field fCover. A multiple regression of fCover derived from both echo types with field fCover showed no increase of R-2 compared to the regression of first echo data, and thus, we only used first echo data for Mover estimation. R2 for the Mover regression was 0.73, with an RMSE of 0.18. For the ALS LAI proxy, R-2 was lower, at 0.69, while the RMSE was 0.01. For LAI larger radii (similar to 15 m) provided best results for our canopy types, which is due to the importance of a larger range of zenith angles (0-60) in LAI estimation from hemispherical photographs. Based on the regression results, maps of Mover and LAI were computed for our study area and compared qualitatively to equivalent maps based on imaging spectrometry, revealing similar spatial patterns and ranges of values.

AB The divergence of horizontal radiation in vegetation canopies is generally considered to be of negligible consequence to 1) algorithms designed for the physically-based interpretation of space home observations, and 2) field campaigns aiming at the validation of derived surface products, like FAPAR and albedo. However, non-zero horizontal radiation balances are likely to occur if the internal variability of the vegetation target and the typical distances that photons may travel horizontally within such 3-D media extend to spatial scales that are similar to or larger than those of the measuring sensor. Detailed radiative transfer simulations in 3-D coniferous forest environments are presented to show how the magnitude of local net horizontal fluxes (for spatial resolutions ranging from 1 x 1 m(2) to 500 x 500 m(2) forest areas) can reach multiple times the incident solar radiation at the top-of-canopy level. Furthermore, the PDFs of these local net horizontal fluxes (H) are skewed toward negative values (meaning that most local canopy volumes have more radiation exiting than entering via their lateral sides), in particular when the radiative regime is dominated by single-scattering interactions and geometric shading is prominent. In order to maintain the energy balance of the overall forest domain, however, local canopy volumes with rather large positive net horizontal fluxes must also exist, thus underscoring the importance of properly locating local flux measurement equipment. Irrespective of the sign of H, it is shown that the local canopy absorption (A) falls within the A-H (perfect shadowing of the forest floor) and A=H+1 (perfect illumination of the forest floor) domain in the red spectral band. This correlation between A and H implies that the range of local canopy absorption values is far larger than unity which reduces its potential to serve as a proxy in delivering accurate domain-averaged absorption estimates on the basis of spatially incomplete sampling schemes. Instead, it is shown that, for a spatial sampling of 1% of the forest area of interest, local absorption estimates - derived from vertical fluxes only - are sufficient for delivering 2 domain-averaged canopy estimates that lie, on average, within 0.05 of the truth. For forest domains that are smaller than about 30 x 30 in however, horizontal radiation transport will still affect the domain-averaged canopy absorption values and thus a spatially exhaustive sampling of the true local absorption may be more appropriate.

AB We describe a new remote sensing system called the Short Wave Aerostat-Mounted Imager (SWAMI). The SWAMI is designed to acquire co-located video imagery and hyperspectral data to study basic remote sensing questions and to link landscape level trace gas fluxes with spatially and temporally appropriate spectral observations. The SWAMI can fly at altitudes up to 2km above ground level to bridge the spatial gap between radiometric measurements collected near the surface and those acquired by other aircraft or satellites. The SWAMI platform consists of a dual channel hyperspectral spectroradiometer, video camera, GPS, thermal infrared sensor, and several meteorological and control sensors. All SWAMI functions (e.g. data acquisition and sensor pointing) can be controlled from the ground via wireless transmission. Sample data from the sampling platform are presented, along with several potential scientific applications of SWAMI data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The accuracy of a supervised image classification is a function of the training data used in its generation. It is, therefore, critical that the training stage of a supervised classification is designed to provide the necessary information. Guidance on the design of the training stage of a classification typically calls for the use of a large sample of randomly selected pure pixels in order to characterise the classes. Such guidance is generally made without regard to the specific nature of the application in-hand, including the classifier to be used. The design of the training stage should really be based on the classifier to be used since individual training cases can vary in value as can any one training set to a range of classifiers. It is argued here that the training stage can be designed on the basis of the way the classifier operates and with emphasis on the desire to separate the classes rather than describe them. An approach to the training of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that is the opposite of that generally promoted for training set design is suggested. This approach uses a small sample of mixed spectral responses drawn from purposefully selected locations (geographical boundaries) in training. The approach is based on mixed pixels which are normally masked-out of analyses as undesirable and problematic. A sample of such data should, however, be easier and cheaper to acquire than that suggested by conventional approaches. This new approach to training set design was evaluated against conventional approaches with a set of classifications of agricultural crops from satellite sensor data. The main result was that classifications derived from the use of the mixed spectral responses and the conventional approach did not differ significantly, with the overall accuracy of classifications generally similar to 92%.

AB Forest monitoring requires more automated systems to analyse the large amount of remote sensing data. A new method of change detection is proposed for identifying forest land cover change using high spatial resolution satellite images. Combining the advantages of image segmentation, image differencing and stochastic analysis of the multispectral signal, this OB-Reflectance method is object-based and statistically driven. From a multidate image, a single segmentation using region-merging technique delineates multidate objects characterised by their reflectance differences statistics. Objects considered as outliers from multitemporal point of view are successfully discriminated thanks to a statistical procedure, i.e., the iterative trimining. Based on a chi-square test of hypothesis, abnormal values of reflectance differences statistics are identified and the corresponding objects are labelled as change. The object-based method performances were assessed using two sources of reference data, including one independent forest inventory, and were compared to a pixel-based method using the RGB-NDVI technique. High detection accuracy (> 90%) and overall Kappa (> 0.80) were achieved by OB-Reflectance method in temperate forests using three SPOT-HRV images covering a 10-year period. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Although partial harvests are common in many forest types globally, there has been little assessment of the potential to map the intensity of these harvests using Landsat data. We modeled basal area removal and percent cover change in a study area in central Washington (northwestern USA) using biennial Landsat imagery and reference data from historical aerial photos and a system of inventory plots. First, we assessed the correlation of Landsat spectral bands and associated indices with measured levels of forest removal. The variables most closely associated with forest removal were the shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands (5 and 7) and those strongly influenced by SWIR reflectance (particularly Tasseled Cap Wetness, and the Disturbance Index). The band and indices associated with near-infrared reflectance (band 4, Tasseled Cap Greenness, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were only weakly correlated with degree of forest removal. Two regression-based methods of estimating forest loss were tested. The first, termed "state model differencing" (SMD), involves creating a model representing the relationship between inventory data from any date and corresponding, cross-notinalized spectral data. This "state model" is then applied to imagery from two dates, with the difference between the two estimates taken as estimated change. The second approach, which we called "direct change modeling" (DCM), involves modeling forest structure changes as a single term using re-measured inventory data and spectral differences from corresponding image pairs. In a leave-one-out cross-validation process, DCM-derived estimates of harvest intensity had lower root mean square errors than SMD for both relative basal area change and relative cover change. The higher measured accuracy of DCM in this project must be weighed against several operational advantages of SMD relating to less restrictive reference data requirements and more specific resultant estimates of change.

ID SUSPENDED SEDIMENTS; OCEAN; SEA
AB Six years (1998-2003) of SeaWiFS multispectral satellite data are used to document the seasonal and interannual variability of the Columbia River plume on the North American west coast. A supervised classification scheme using 5 channels of normalized water-leaving radiance (nLw at 412, 443, 490, 510 and 555 nm), with training pixels adjusted temporally to optimize the signature of plume core characteristics, quantifies the climatological seasonal location of 4 spectrally defined classes of surface water and provides estimates of variability in position as a probability. Winter plume orientation was northward and close to the shore, with infrequent adjustments to the south. Summer plume orientation was offshore and to the south, dissociated from the coast, with more frequent (> 20%) occurrences of plume water and peripheral plume water (> 50%) to the north. An effective characterization of interannual variability in plume dynamics is provided by time series of temporally averaged nLw at 555 nm, used as an estimate of suspended particulate material. Monthly means during maxima and minima in annual river discharge show the plume to be weakest both in spatial extent as well as absolute nLw values in 2001, a year of minimum river discharge. Time series of both (a) nLw 555 values at the river mouth and (b) Mode 2 of an empirical orthogonal function decomposition of the 6-year nLw 555 time series variance that isolates winter patterns are strongly correlated with river discharge. Interannual differences in monthly mean wind forcing are evident as changes in plume position during the winter, but at the 8-day and longer time scales examined here, summer interannual differences are dominated by differences in discharge volume.

AB Extensive reflected GPS data was collected using a GPS reflectometer installed on an HC130 aircraft during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02) near Ames, Iowa. At the same time, widespread surface truth data was acquired in the form of point soil moisture profiles, areal sampling of near-surface soil moisture, total green biomass and precipitation history, among others. Previously, there have been no reported efforts to calibrate reflected GPS data sets acquired over land. This paper reports the results of two approaches to calibration of the data that yield consistent results. It is shown that estimating the strength of the reflected signals by either (1) assuming an approximately specular surface reflection or (2) inferring the surface slope probability density and associated normalization constants give essentially the same results for the conditions encountered in SMEX02. The corrected data is converted to surface reflectivity and then to dielectric constant as a test of the calibration approaches. Utilizing the extensive in-situ soil moisture related data this paper also presents the results of comparing the GPS-inferred relative dielectric constant with the Wang-Schmugge model frequently used to relate volume moisture content to dielectric constant. It is shown that the calibrated GPS reflectivity estimates follow the expected dependence of permittivity with volume moisture, but with the following qualification: The soil moisture value governing the reflectivity appears to come from only the top 1-2 cm of soil, a result consistent with results found for other microwave techniques operating at L-band. Nevertheless, the experimentally derived dielectric constant is generally lower than predicted. Possible explanations are presented to explain this result. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the factors that influence the incidence and dispersal patterns of freshwater runoff plumes in southern California is important for management of coastal water quality. Significant river discharge is associated with episodic winter rainstorms, leading to turbid pollutant and pathogen-laden stormwater plumes that are clearly visible nearshore in the Southern California Bight. We analyzed 1.1-km spatial resolution sea-spectral reflectance data acquired in 1997-2003 by the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), focusing on four regions with distinctive adjacent watershed properties: Ventura, Santa Monica Bay, San Pedro Shelf, and Orange County/San Diego. The area of each plume was detected by the backscattering characteristics of surface waters, i.e., normalized water-leaving radiation of green-yellow wavelength 555 nm (nLw555). Plume area size was correlated with the rainstorm magnitude, which was estimated from atmospheric precipitation averaged over the total area of the watersheds connected to the seashore. The time lag between rainstorm and maximum plume was one day in San Pedro Shelf and two days in other three regions. Assessing maximum correlation between precipitated rainwater and the plume size, we estimated the optimal nLw555 values best characterizing the plume boundaries in each of the four study regions. Another quantitative characteristic derived from maximum correlation between rainwater and plume size was the "coefficient of persistence", related to the speed of freshwater discharge and the time of plume water dissipation; it was also different in different watersheds. The primary factors regulating the relationship between rainstorm and plume were watershed land-use characteristics, size, and elevation. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study applies an edge detection method to satellite sea surface temperature (SST) images in order to distinguish SST fronts frequently occurring near the Japanese coast. First, we develop a new set of edge detection algorithms. The method is based on an entropic approach using Jensen-Shannon divergence, which is certified as a robust technique for detecting edge pixel candidates. Additionally, we incorporate ridge-line extraction morphological filter to obtain edge pixels, which is suited to delineate intricate frontal features. The methodology allows us to detect reasonable amount of possible fronts to the fullest extent according to the original image resolution. Therefore, it enables us to analyze finer-scale fronts near the coast as well as larger-scale fronts associated with major currents. Then, we present four case study examples of SST fronts near the Japanese coast by applying the method to Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) SST images with a grid size of 0.01 degrees. We describe the configuration and seasonal variability of the SST frontal systems from the viewpoint of occurrence probability, SST gradient magnitude, and orientation to the local bathymetry as compared with the previous observational studies. Consequently, it is demonstrated that application of the method can derive new views of finer-scale and highly variable SST fronts. Moreover, this study first verifies the capability of comprehensive and statistical description of SST front configurations and variations near the Japanese coast by applying edge detection method to sequences of satellite SST images.

AB Non-invasive remote sensing techniques for monitoring plant stress and photosynthetic status have received much attention. The majority of published vegetation indices are not sensitive to rapid changes in plant photosynthetic status brought on by common environmental stressors such as diurnal fluxes in irradiance and heat. This is due to the fact that most vegetation indices have no direct link to photosynthetic functioning beyond their sensitivity to canopy structure and pigment concentration changes. In contrast, this study makes progress on a more direct link between passive reflectance measurements and plant physiological status through an understanding of photochemical quenching (qP) and non-photochemical quenching processes. This is accomplished through the characterization of steady-state fluorescence (Fs) and its influence on apparent reflectance in the red-edge spectral region. A series of experiments were conducted under controlled environmental conditions, linking passive reflectance measurements of a grapevine canopy (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) to leaf level estimates Of CO2 assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (g), qP, and Fs. Plant stress was induced by imposing a diurnal heat stress and recovery event and by withholding water from the plant canopy over the course of the experiment. We outlined evidence for a link between Fs and photosynthetic status, identified the Fs signal in passive remote sensing reflectance data, and related reflectance-derived estimates of Fs to plant photosynthetic status. These results provide evidence that simple reflectance indices calculated in the red-edge spectral region can track temperature and water-induced changes in Fs and, consequently, provide a rapid assessment of plant stress that is directly linked to plant physiological processes.

AB We present a study on MOPITT (Measurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere) detection of CO emission from large forest fires in the year 2000 in the northwest United States. Fire data used are from the space-borne Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at 1 -km resolution. The study shows that MOPITT can reliably detect CO plumes from forest fires whenever there are > 30 AVHRR hotspots in a 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees grid, which is comparable to the pixel area of MOPITT in the region. The spatial CO pattern during the fire events is found to be consistent with the location and density of AVHRR hotspots and wind direction. While the increase of CO abundance inside the study area is closely correlated to the AVHRR-derived hotspot number in general (R > 0.75), the non-linearity of fire emission with fuel consumption is also observed. MOPITT can also capture the temporal variation in CO emission from forest fires through 3 -day composites so it may offer an opportunity to enhance our knowledge of temporal fire emission over large areas. The CO emission is quantitatively estimated with a one-box model. The result is compared with a bottom-up approach using surface data including burnt area, biomass density, and fire emission factors. If mean emission factors for the region are used, the bottom-up approach results in total emission estimates which are 10%-50% lower than the MOPITT-based estimate. In spite of the limitations and uncertainties addressed in this study, MOPITT data may provide a useful constraint on uncertain ground-based fire emission estimates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study presents the first results obtained with the ENVISAT satellite radar altimeter RA-2 over lands and ice caps. As radar altimetry was firstly devoted to ocean study, this paper starts with a detailed description of the radar altimetry principle over continental surfaces: a general formulation of the radar altimeter echoes according to different surface types is given and the retracking procedure ICE-2, specially implemented on the ENVISAT satellite ground segment to provide output parameters over continents, is clearly presented. The ENVISAT RA-2 datasets processed with the ICE-2 procedure are then mapped given an overall description of the output parameters over various surfaces. The behaviour of these ENVISAT altimetric parameters are analysed and related to main land surface characteristics such as surface/volume echo, specularity, roughness.... Apart from few unexpected signals which will need to be further investigated, the new ENVISAT dataset confirms the potential of inland altimetry and provides a new opportunity to monitor continental surfaces. The Ku band measurements confirm previous results recently obtained with the altimeters on board ERS or Topex-Poseidon and offer a temporal continuity. The S band altimeter measurements are in accordance with theoretical expected ones and confirm previous Topex-Poseidon observations in C band. The S band and the use of the dual-frequency thus bring new capabilities for altimetric applications with important deliveries for temporal evolution survey. For instance, S band will be used over continents to better detect wetlands located under vegetated areas or to better quantify wave penetration in terrestrial snowpack to accurately retrieve snow depth evolution. Over ice sheets, the dual-frequency S and Ku band waveforms parameters will provide a more accurate height estimation as it will be possible to quantify the error on height measurements induced by snowpack structure change over time. This will then provide a more confident survey of the ice sheets surface topography evolution. The combination and complementarities with the other altimetry missions such as ERS, Topex-Poseidon and Jason look already promising and offer a 10-year span dataset for continental altimetry applications.

AB Understanding global climate change and developing strategies for sustainable use of our environmental resources are major scientific and political challenges. In response to an announcement of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) for a national Earth observation (EO) mission, the Friedrich-Schiller University Jena and the JenaOptronik GmbH proposed the EO mission Carbon-3D. The data products of this mission will for the first time accurately estimate aboveground biomass globally, one of the most important parameters of the carbon cycle. Simultaneous acquisition of multiangle optical with Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) observations is unprecedented. The optical imager extrapolates the laser-retrieved height profiles to biophysical vegetation maps. This innovative mission will reduce uncertainties about net effects of deforestation and forest regrowth on atmospheric CO2 concentrations and will also provide key biophysical information for biosphere models.

AB The directional surface temperatures over urban areas are measured using an airborne TIR camera equipped with wide-angle lenses. The experimental design is described and the possible sources of errors related to the instruments and the atmosphere are analysed and corrections proposed. The data acquisition protocol is adapted to provide directional TIR measurements in a - 60degrees to + 60degrees range for zenith and 0 to 360degrees for azimuth view angles. Two parts of the city of Marseille, the densely built old city centre and a built/vegetated mixture of individual houses and gardens in a suburb, have been studied during summer 2001 in the framework of the UBL-ESCOMPTE project. The results obtained reveal important hot spot effects and differences of surface brightness temperatures varying between - 5 and 7 K between nadir. and off-nadir measurements, according to azimuth view angles. Acquisitions performed over the two areas also illustrate the impact of the surface structure and presence of vegetation on the hot spot. An example application for the correction of two temporal series of NOAA 14 and NOAA 16 data is given. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An innovative, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-based technique for improved automatic detection of volcanic hotspots and thermal anomalies is proposed in this paper. It is mainly based on a multitemporal analysis of historical, long-term satellite records. Such a technique basically rests on the Robust AVHRR Techniques (RAT) approach, which has been already successfully applied to several natural and environmental emergencies (e.g., fires, floods, earthquakes). In this work, the proposed technique has been tested on an extended set of eruptive events of Mt. Etna and Stromboli volcanoes. Results achieved, in terms of reliability (low false alarm rate) as well as of effectiveness (detection sensitivity), are described in detail. Moreover, the potential in low-level thermal anomaly detection, as possible pre-emptive thermal signs, is also addressed and preliminary results obtained for a couple of events, discussed. The Study cases here presented show the benefits of such a technique especially when different observational conditions (time/season of pass, atmospheric moisture content, solar illumination, satellite angles of view, etc.) are considered, making such a method globally applicable.
   The future prospects, also in terms of possible operational scenarios, coming from the implementation of such an approach on the new generation of satellite sensors (Such as SEVIRI aboard Meteosat Second Generation) are also discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID EVAPOTRANSPIRATION; MODEL; WATER
AB A simplified equation to estimate spatial reference evapotranspiration (ETo-Ts) from remote sensing-based surface temperature (T-s) and local standard meteorological data is suggested. It is based on a parameterization of the meteorological conditions of the first few meters of the atmosphere through two parameters (a and b) which come from a simpler form of the Penman-Monteith equation:
   ETo-Ts = aT(s) + b
   This approach is of local nature since the parameters a and b must be estimated for a given area from meteorological data. The spatial pattern and temporal evolution in ETo-Ts have been analyzed using 58 NOAA-AVHRR images from 1992 to 1996 in a flat, subhumid region in the center of the Buenos Aires province, Argentina. The modelled ETo-Ts. has been compared with local measurements, and I results indicate that the error of estimate is 0.6 mm day. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A sequence of five high-resolution satellite-based land surface temperature (T,) images over a watershed area in Iowa were analyzed. As a part of the SMEX02 field experiment, these land surface temperature images were extracted from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) thermal bands. The radiative transfer model MODTRAN 4.1 was used with atmospheric profile data to atmospherically correct the Landsat data. NDVI derived from Landsat visible and near-infrared bands was used to estimate fractional vegetation cover, which in turn was used to estimate emissivity for Landsat thermal bands. The estimated brightness temperature was compared with concurrent tower based measurements. The mean absolute difference (MAD) between the satellite-based brightness temperature estimates and the tower based brightness temperature was 0.98 degreesC for Landsat 7 and 1.47 degreesC for Landsat 5, respectively. Based on these images, the land surface temperature spatial variation and its change with scale are addressed. The scaling properties of the surface temperature are important as they have significant implications for changes in land surface flux estimation between higher-resolution Landsat and regional to global sensors such as MODIS.

AB The Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) was a large, multiyear internationally supported study designed to improve our understanding of the boreal forest biome and its interactions with the atmosphere, biosphere, and the carbon cycle in the face of global climate change. In the initial phase of this study (early 1990s), remote sensing played a key role by providing products needed for planning and modeling. During and after the main BOREAS field campaigns (1994 and 1996), innovative remote sensing approaches and analyses expanded our understanding of the boreal forest in four key areas: (1) definition of vegetation structure, (2) land-cover classification, (3) assessment of the carbon balance, and (4) links between surface properties, weather, and climate. In addition to six BOREAS special issues and over 500 journal papers, a principal legacy of BOREAS is its well-documented and publicly available database, which provides a lasting scientific resource and opportunity to further advance our understanding of this critical northern biome.

AB Leaf chlorophyll content in coniferous forest canopies, a measure of stand condition, is the target of studies and models linking leaf reflectance and transmittance and canopy hyperspectral reflectance imagery. The viability of estimation of needle chlorophyll content from airborne hyperspectral optical data through inversion of linked leaf level and canopy level radiative transfer models is discussed in this paper. This study is focused on five sites of Jack Pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) in the Algoma Region (Canada), where field, laboratory and airborne data were collected in 1998 and 1999 campaigns. Airborne hyperspectral CASI data of 72 bands in the visible and near-infrared region and 2 in spatial resolution were collected from 20 X 20 m study sites of Jack Pine in 2 consecutive years. It was found that needle chlorophyll content could be estimated at the leaf level (r(2) = 0.4) by inversion of the PROSPECT leaf model from needle reflectance and transmittance spectra collected with a special needle carrier apparatus coupled to the Li-Cor 1800 integrating sphere. The Jack Pine forest stands used for this study with LAI > 2, and the high spatial resolution hyperspectral reflectance collected, allowed the use of the SPRINT canopy reflectance model coupled to PROSPECT for needle chlorophyll content estimation by model inversion. The optical index R750/ R710 was used as the merit function in the numerical inversion to minimize the effect of shadows and LAI variation in the mean canopy reflectance from the 20 x 20 in plots. Estimates of needle pigment content from airborne hyperspectral reflectance using this linked leaf-canopy model inversion methodology showed an r(2) = 0.4 and RMSE = 8.1 mug/cm(2) when targeting sunlit crown pixels in Jack Pine sites with pigment content ranging between 26.8 and 56.8 mug/cm(2) (1570-3320 mug/g).

AB One-day interval coherence images derived from pairs of ERS SAR tandem acquisitions are suitable for crop monitoring. Coherence images were analyzed and compared to field measurements of four crops, i.e., winter wheat, sugar beet, potato and maize, taken during the satellite overpass. First, the sensitivity of the coherence to the plant height and the canopy cover was statistically investigated. Regression analyses were computed and the coefficients of determination (R-2) ranged from 0.64 to 0.92. The shape of these relationships varied according to the geometric factors which are crop-type dependent. A prediction model of the wheat height was calculated and was able to estimate the plant height with a mean absolute error of approximately 7 cm. While this high performance obtained on the average matched the observed range of the field height for a given date, it was not sufficient for monitoring at the field level. However, such a performance level may meet the information requirements for an operational crop monitoring system at the regional level, which includes a much larger diversity of growing conditions. Moreover, the soil roughness change associated with the sowing practices that occurred between the two tandem acquisitions strongly decreased the coherence signal. This dataset also indicated that variation in the soil moisture influenced the backscattering coefficient more than it influenced the coherence signal. This result enhanced the InSAR coherence potentialities to estimate the crop parameters during the growing season. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The regression analyses undertaken commonly in remote sensing are aspatial, ignoring the locational information associated with each sample site at which the variables under study were measured. Typically, basic ordinary least squares regression analysis is used to derive a relationship that is believed to be uniformly applicable across the study area. Although such global analyses may appear satisfactory, often with large coefficients of determination derived, they may provide an inappropriate description of the relationship between the variables under study. In particular, a global regression analysis may miss local detail that can be significant if the relationship is spatially nonstationary. Local statistical approaches, such as geographically weighted regression, include the spatial coordinates of the sample sites in the analysis and may provide a more appropriate basis for the investigation of the relationship between variables. The potential value of geographically weighted regression to the remote sensing community is illustrated with reference to the relationship between the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and rainfall over north Africa and the Middle East over an 8-year period. For each year, spatial non-stationarity was evident, particularly with regard to the slope parameter of the regression model. Moreover, the conventional ordinary least squares regression models, while superficially strong (minimum R-2 = 0.67), were relatively poor local descriptors of the relationship. Relative to this, the geographically weighted approach to regression provided considerably stronger relationships from the same data sets (minimum R-2 = 0.96) as well as highlighting areas of local variation. The implications of the difference in the outputs from the two types of regression analysis are illustrated with reference to the use of the derived NDVI-rainfall relationships in mapping desert extent. For example, with the data relating to 1987 the southern limit of the Sahara was generally estimated to lie at a more southerly position when the relationship derived from OLS rather than geographically weighted regression was used.

AB The power received by a GPS receiver located on an airplane flying over the ocean and collecting the GPS signal reflected off the surface is estimated for varying wind speed and wind direction, platform altitude, satellite elevation angle, and receiver integration time. By accounting for the wind-induced anisotropy on the surface, it is shown that the trailing edges of computed waveforms change with both wind speed and direction. When the receiver integration time is properly chosen, substantial differences in the waveforms at different wind directions are exhibited even at the beginning of the trailing edge, particularly for reflections from high-elevation satellites. These differences are associated with the extent and directional properties of the scattered fields as a function of reflection angle. An analysis of the interdependence of the observational (geometric) parameters, the coherence time, and the receiver integration time is presented to suggest a suitable arrangement for enhanced measurement sensitivity to the wind direction.

AB The Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) team was formed to leverage government agencies' capabilities for the characterization of commercial remote sensing data. The team is composed of staff from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Each JACIE agency has a vested interest in the purchase and use of commercial imagery to support its research and applications. It is critical that this imagery be assessed for its accuracy and utility. Through JACIE, NASA, NIMA, and USGS jointly characterized image products from Space Imaging's IKONOS satellite. The JACIE team acquired IKONOS imagery of several study sites to perform the assessments. Each JACIE agency performed an aspect of the characterization according to its area of expertise. NASA and its university partners performed a system characterization focusing on radiometric calibration, geopositional accuracy, and spatial resolution assessment; NIMA performed image interpretability and feature extraction evaluations; and the USGS assessed the geopositional accuracy of several IKONOS products. The results of the JACIE team's IKONOS effort, which were discussed with Space Imaging and then presented at an industry - government workshop, ensured and improved overall product quality and benefited both the commercial industry and the government. Additional JACIE activities include the characterization of other commercial products such as those from the DigitalGlobe QuickBird and the Orbital Imaging (Orbimage) OrbView-3 satellites.

AB The main objective of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission over the land surface is to monitor surface soil moisture (SM) from measurements of the microwave emission at L-band. These measurements will be done at many incidence angles and two polarizations. The multiconfiguration system of SMOS provides the possibility to retrieve one or several surface parameters in addition to soil moisture. Such an approach, referred to as N-parameter retrievals (where N is the number of retrieved parameters), could make the retrieval process more efficient. In this study, this possibility was investigated using an experimental dataset acquired over a wheat field. First, a detailed analysis of the attenuation properties of the wheat canopy, a vertical-stem dominated crop, was made. The results showed that the polarization and incidence angle dependence of attenuation was very significant and could be accurately modeled using only two parameters: the optical depth tau at nadir (tau(theta = 0)) and a polarization parameter (C(pol)). The need for this latter parameter results from the difference in the dielectric properties of wheat for the vertical and horizontal polarizations. Based on these results, a detailed comparison of different soil moisture retrieval approaches was made. One-, two-, and three-parameter retrieval approaches were tested. In this latter method, soil moisture and the two vegetation parameters (tau(theta = 0) and C(pol)) were retrieved simultaneously. This method was found to be the most efficient: it provided the best accuracy in the SM retrievals and it did not require ancillary information on the vegetation characteristics, which cannot be easily estimated for operational SM mapping applications.

AB Nearly simultaneous reflectance data sets from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), at 30-m resolution, and the Terra satellite instrument MODIS, at 500-m resolution, are compared for their ability to map fractional coverage of surface types over large areas. Lower spatial resolution MODIS classification results are generally comparable those of ETM+, with discrepancies for some regions with mixed surface types. Analysis of laboratory and field spectra suggests an ambiguity, the "brightness ambiguity", which can prevent accurate area estimation of pixels having two or more surface types. This ambiguity, plus general mathematical inversion issues, can account for the discrepancy. Thus, occasional high-resolution measurements, as from Landsat 7, are necessary to refine estimations of large area surface types from MODIS and similar lower spatial resolution instruments.

AB A regional phenology model for detecting onset of vegetation greenness was developed using year 2001MODIS land products in temperate mixed forests in Korea. The model incorporates a digital elevation model (DEM), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) landcover and leaf area index (LAI) products, and climate data from weather-monitoring stations. MODIS-based onset of greenness varied spatially and showed significant correlation with air temperature (r = -0.70, p < 0.001). Our modeling methodology is to relate thermal summation calculated using the MODIS-based timing of onset with 30-year mean air temperature. Onset of greenness is expected to occur at values above the critical thermal summation threshold and is predicted to vary spatially. An algorithm for downscaling 8-day composite MODIS LAI product to a daily unit was introduced, and its predictability was validated using ground-measured onset of greenness. Two unknown parameters and the best regression were determined by iterative cross-validation. Minimal cross-validation errors between the predicted and MODIS-based timings of onset were found at a mean absolute error (MAE = 3.0 days) and bias (+ 1.6 days). The predicted onsets show good agreement with ground-measured onset of greenness (MAE = 2.5 days and bias = +2.5 days). This study demonstrates the utility of MODIS land products as tools for detecting spatial variability in phenology across climate gradients. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new empirical model for the retrieval, at a field scale, of the bare soil moisture content and the surface roughness characteristics from radar measurements is proposed. The derivation of the algorithm is based on the results of three experimental radar campaigns conducted under natural conditions over agricultural areas. Radar data were acquired by means of several C-band space home (SIR-C, RADARSAT) or helicopter borne (ERASME) sensors, operating in different configurations of polarization (HH or VV) and incidence angle. Simultaneously to radar acquisitions, a complete ground truth data base was built up with different surface condition measurements of the mean standard deviation (rms) heights, the correlation length l, and the volumetric surface moisture M-nu. This algorithm is more specifically developed using the radar cross-section sigma(0) (HH polarization and 39degrees incidence angle off nadir), namely, sigma(0HH,39), and the differential (HH polarization) radar cross-section Deltasigma(0) = sigma(0,23degrees) - sigma(0,39degrees) in terms of an original roughness parameter, Z(s), namely Z(s) = s(2)/l, and M-nu. A good agreement is observed between model outputs and backscattering measurements over different test fields. Eventually, an inversion technique is proposed to retrieve Z(s) and M-nu from radar measurements. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A project to characterize the Moderate Resolution-Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) spatial response (SR) using preflight Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) validation data and on-orbit imagery is described, and the results from the analyses are presented. The preflight validation data are used to estimate the optical blurring parameters to complete a system MTF model for MODIS bands 1 and 2. The model and data indicate that the prelaunch MTF is higher for band 2 than for band 1. The on-orbit imagery is used in a two-image MTF estimation technique to characterize the on-orbit MTF for MODIS bands 1 and 2. Three data sets coincident with MODIS collects are used, Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery of Maricopa Agricultural Center, Arizona, on September 26, 2000 and May 24, 2001 and ASTER imagery of Mono Lake, CA, on September 29, 2000. The on-orbit MTFs obtained to date are consistent with prelaunch validation MTF measurements in the cross-track direction, but are less than prelaunch MTFs in the in-track direction. Further analysis is in progress to confirm these results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data were the basis in production of a statewide land cover data set for Wisconsin, undertaken in partnership with U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Gap Analysis Program (GAP). The data set contained seven classes comparable to Anderson Level I and 24 classes comparable to Anderson Level II/III. Twelve scenes of dual-date TM data were processed with methods that included principal components analysis, stratification into spectrally consistent units, separate classification of upland, wetland, and urban areas, and/a hybrid supervised/unsupervised classification called "guided clustering." The final data had overall accuracies of 94% for Anderson Level I upland classes, 77% for Level II/III upland classes, and 84% for Level II/III wetland classes. Classification accuracies for deciduous and coniferous forest were 95% and 93%, respectively, and forest species' overall accuracies ranged from 70% to 84%. Limited availability of acceptable imagery necessitated use of an early May date in a majority of scene pairs, perhaps contributing to lower accuracy for upland deciduous forest species, The mixed deciduous/coniferous forest class had the lowest accuracy, most likely due to distinctly classifying a purely mixed class. Mixed forest signatures containing oak were often confused with pure oak. Guided clustering was seen as an efficient classification method, especially at the tree species level, although its success relied in part on image dates, accurate ground truth, and some analyst intervention.

AB This study presents an approach for the determination of the trophic parameters Secchi disk transparency and chlorophyll-a from hyperspectral airborne casi and HyMap data with multitemporal validity. Based on in Situ water sampling and reflectance measurements, algorithms have been developed. For Secchi disk transparency, the area between a base line and the spectrum from 400 to 750 nm was calculated and correlated to the Secchi disk transparency measured in situ; chlorophyll-a concentration was quantified using the existing reflectance ratio at 705 and 678 nm, which showed a linear relationship to chlorophyll-a concentration from laboratory spectrophotometric measurements. The algorithms have been adapted to the spectral characteristics of the airborne sensors and applied to these data recorded in September 1997 and 1998 and May and June 1999. The validation using independent in situ reference data showed mean standard errors of 1.2-1.3 m for Secchi disk transparency and of 10.2-10.9 mug/l chlorophyll-a. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Estimation of freshwater flux over a certain region is very difficult, as it needs both accurate evaporation and precipitation rates over the study area. Over the Indian Ocean (10), the precipitation estimates are totally lacking or unknown due to the lack of in-situ measurements. In the present study, we examine the climatology and the annual cycle of the freshwater flux over the 10 using the newly available Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite data (HOAPS). This data set has been derived from passive microwave and infrared satellite data utilising the data from the Special Sensor Microwavelmager (SSM/I) and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHMR). We have compared the freshwater flux estimates from HOAPS data set with the earlier estimates to see how they differ from the older estimates. The evaporation rates from HOAPS are significantly different from the earlier estimates. The annual cycle of freshwater flux shows that the Bay of Bengal (BB) is a moisture convergence region most of the year as compared to the Arabian Sea (AS), which is a moisture flux divergence region. Further, the build-up of moisture in the southern Indian Ocean (SIO) is also clearly seen from March to June, indicating its major role in the summer monsoon activity over the Indian subcontinent. An analysis of monthly mean freshwater flux indicates that a small pail of the southwest coast of India and southern parts of the BB region receives freshwater in April almost 2 months ahead of the onset of the summer monsoon.

AB The integral Equation Model (IEM) was previously used in conjunction with an inversion model to retrieve soil moisture using multifrequency and multipolarization data from Spaceborne Imaging Radar C-band (SIR-C) and X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR). Convergence rates well above 90%, and small RMS errors were attained, for both vegetated and bare soil areas, using radar data collected during Washita 1994. However, the IEM was originally developed to describe the scattering from bare soil surfaces only, and, therefore, vegetation backscatter effects are not explicitly incorporated in the model. in this study, the problem is addressed by introducing a simple, semiempirical, vegetation scattering parameterization to the multifrequency, soil moisture inversion algorithm. The parameterization was formulated in the framework of the water-cloud model and relies on the concept of a land-cover (land-use)-based dimensionless vegetation correlation length to represent the spatial variability of vegetation across the landscape and radar-shadow effects (vegetation layovers). An application of the modified inversion model to the Washita 1994 data lead to a decrease of 32% in the RMSE, while the correlation coefficient between ground-based and SAR-derived soil moisture estimates improved from 0.84 to 0.95.

AB Using 180 degrees field of view imaging polarimetry, we measured the polarization characteristics (degree and angle of linear polarization) of the entire clear sunset sky and the reflection-polarization pattern of the flat water surface under this sky in order to test the validity of the earlier theoretical predictions made by Horvath, G. (1995) [Reflection-polarization patterns at flat water surfaces and their relevance for insect polarization vision. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 175, 27-37] and Schwind, R., & Horvath, G. (1993) [Reflection-polarization pattern at water surfaces and correction of a common representation of the polarization pattern of the sky, Naturwissenschaften, 80, 82-83] on the fine structure of this reflection-polarization pattern. We compared the measured reflection-polarization pattern with the theoretical reflection-polarization patterns computed for single-scattering Rayleigh skylight and measured real skylight reflected from the flat water surface, the repolarization characteristics of which are described by the Fresnel theory. Analysing and comparing the theoretical and measured reflection-polarization patterns, we could establish that the earlier predictions of Horvath (1995) and Schwind and Horvath (1993) were correct. Contrary to other full-sky polarimeters, our 180 degrees field of view rotating-analyzer imaging photopolarimeter is useful not only for sky measurements, but also for downward viewing polarimetry. It can be used in atmospheric optics as well as in biological investigations involving animal polarization vision and orientation on the basis of skylight polarization or water-surface-reflected polarized light.

A brief review of the main characteristics and scales of atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) first establishes their importance in atmospheric dynamics. The shape and scale of the wave patterns observed in successive SAR images are compared with those calculated from AGW models. There is agreement between the small-scale wind variations across wave patterns in SAR images and the larger-scale wind field that plays a role in the generation of the observed waves.

We use three successive images with 15-minute time differences of the northern hemisphere from 03:31 UTC to 04:15 UTC throughout the period. A simple physical model is applied to the visible image of GMS-5 to estimate the isolation at the ground in 0.01 degrees grids. The estimates of hourly insolation have been improved at 63 of the 67 validation. Therefore, as the combination of geostationary meteorological satellites, for examples, GMS-5 and FY-2 (Chinese Geostationary meteorological Satellite), running in two shifts provides twice as frequent observation than each of them. The improvement for hourly insolation than each of them. The improvement foe hourly insolation estimate can be operational. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Arid and semiarid ecosystems endure strong spatial and temporal variation of climate and land use that results in uniquely dynamic vegetation phenology, cover, and leaf area characteristics Previous remote sensing efforts have not fully captured the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation properties required for functional analyses of these ecosystems, or have done so only with manually intensive algorithms of spectral mixture analysis that have limited operational use. Those limitations motivated the development of an automated spectral unmixing approach based on, a comprehensive analysis of vegetation and soil spectral variability resulting from biogeophysical variation in arid and semiarid regions. A field spectroscopic database of bare soils, green canopies, and litter canopies was compiled for 17 arid and semiarid sites in North and South America, representing a wide array of plant growth forms and species, vegetation conditions, and soil mineralogical-hydrological properties. Spectral reflectance of dominant cover types (green vegetation, litter, and bare soil) varied widely within and between sites, but the reflectance derivatives in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR2: 2,100-2,400 nm) were similar within and separable between each cover type. Using this result, art automated SWIR2 spectral unmixing algorithm was developed that includes a Monte Carlo approach for estimating errors in derived subpixel cover fractions resulting from endmember variability. The algorithm was applied to SWIR2 spectral data collected by the Airborne Visible and infrared Imaging Spectrometer instrument over the Sevilleta and Jornada Long-Term Ecological Re-search sites. Subsequent comparisons to field data and geographical information system (GIS) maps were deemed successful. The SWIR2 region of the reflected solar spectrum provides a robust means to estimate the extent of bare soil and vegetation covers in arid and semiarid regions. The computationally efficient method developed here could be extended globally using SWIR2 spectrometer data to be collected from platforms such as the NASA Earth Observing-1 satellite.

AB Researchers have sought techniques for estimating plant canopy characteristics from remote sensing data that are not site-specific. In this study, a procedure for estimating cotton (Gossypium spp.) canopy ground cover based on a linear mixture modeling approach was tested using Landsat multispectral imagery. Ground cover estimated from scene reflectance in the red and near-infrared wavebands was compared with corresponding field measurement. Statistical analysis of the results suggest that the procedure produced accurate, unbiased estimates of cotton canopy ground cover. The procedure appeared to implicitly compensate for the effects of shadows in the scene. These results agree with the findings of earlier studies and support the proposition that this procedure should be more universally applicable than commonly used empirical curve-fit techniques.

AB During recent decades, drought and anthropogenic influences have led to the diminishment of Lake Chad with adverse effects on both food and water resources. The local population has learned to adapt to the reduced seasonal inundation of the lake basin but are vulnerable to both droughts and excessive inflows. Here synergistic satellite radar altimetry and near-infrared imagery are employed to gain knowledge of the current flooding patterns. Variations in surface level for the inflowing rivers and the permanent and seasonal lake waters are derived for the 1990s using data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer images provide additional variations of basin inundation from 1995 to 1998, using a simple pixel histogram technique. With accuracy greater than or equal to 10cm rms, the altimetry reveals seasonal water-level variations of the order 0.5-6 m and there is a notable rise in minimum levels, 15-35 cm year(-1) within the lake basin. Peak-level phase lags of 4 to 5 months are also observed between the headwaters of the Chari/Logone rivers and the western lake marshes. Image results reveal that the permanent lake area is similar to 1.385 km(2), and that with an accuracy of similar to 5% the surrounding regions have been additionally flooding by up to similar to 3,600 km(2) year (-1). Despite current basin complexities, the synergistic area/level measurements corroborate the know hydraulic relationship at low water levels.

AB This investigation uses multiple-view-angle spectral data to estimate forest characteristics by inverting a geometric-optical reflectance model. The emphasis of the work was to assess to what extent multi-angle data can be used to help reduce the difficulties in model inversion, caused by variations in the background spectral reflectances. Inversions were tested with both simulated reflectance data and multi-angle Advanced Solid-state Array Spectrometer (ASAS) data. The background reflectances were included in the inversion process, with the assumptions that these are independent of viewing geometry, and the multi-angle data were acquired on a single date, with a constant solar zenith angle. Inversions using multi-angle data gave more accurate retrieval of stand characteristics than inversions using only nadir data; multi-angle data helped to reduce the problem of local minima in the inversion by providing additional information, with uncorrelated samples having the greatest utility. The utility of inversion was dependent on specification of the correct general range of background reflectances as constraints in the inversion process. Evaluation of the effects of errors in both the reflectance data and the ancillary data highlighted some important difficulties encountered in practice. The results indicate that multi-angle data have potential for improving the accuracy of forest characteristics derived by inversion, but further testing seems essential to better understand the limits of the method in practice.

AB Previous research has shown that wet soil conditions found at fire-disturbed sites in the boreal region produce bright backscatter on ERS imagery compared with the surrounding unburned forest. ERS-2 and Radarsat imagery collected at two incidence angles is presented and compared. Measured brightness is also compared to backscatter model results. It is found that Radarsat imagery collected at incidence angles similar to ERS-2 results in a similar, relatively bright backscatter from the fires scar, while backscatter from Radarsat image collected at a higher incidence angle is relatively dark. Model results confirm that incidence angle is critical in determining the relative brightness of the backscatter from fire scars. These results have implications when looking at broad-coverage SAR images which span a large range of incidence angles from near to far range. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB Biophysical structural information such as biomass, LAI, and NPP are important inputs to regional scale models of ecosystem processes and photosynthetic activity within boreal forests. However, traditional methods such as NDVI for deriving these variables from remotely sensed data have been inconsistent and unsatisfactory due to factors such as the confounding influence of background reflectance and canopy geometry on the overall pixel signal. To address this problem, we present new results which use spectral mixture analysis to determine areal fractions of sunlit canopy, sunlit background, and shadow at subpixel scales for predicting these biophysical variables. Geometric-optical reflectance models are used to estimate sunlit canopy component reflectance for input to the analysis together with field measures of background and shadow reflectance. In this article, we compare cylinder, cone, and spheroid models of canopy geometry and evaluate the importance of solar zenith angle variations in reflectance estimates for mixture fractions. These are computed from helicopter MMR radiometer data for 31 stands of black spruce along a gl-adient of stand densities near the southern fringe of the North American boreal fo-est. Component fractions are evaluated against ground data derived from dense-grid point analyses of coincident high resolution color photography and also for predicting biophysical variables. In general, the Li-Strahler spheroid model was better than the cone and cylinder models and the importance of correcting for solar zenith angle (SZA) was illustrated, with significant improvements noted for higher SZA as a result of corrections for canopy mutual shadowing. The best overall results were obtained from the shadow; fraction using a spheroid model of canopy geometry at SZA 45 degrees. Linens regression analyses showed biomass could be estimated with r(2) values of 0.83 and a standard error (S.E.) of 1.7 kg/m(2); LAI: r(2) = 0.82, S.E. = 0.46; and NPP: r(2) = 0.86, S.E. = 0.05 kg/m(2)/yr. These results were significantly higher than with NDVI for estimating biomass (r(2) = 0.44), LAI (r(2) = 0.60), and NPP (r(2) = 0.56). Current and future areas of research are outlined towards improving our understanding of carbon cycling in large forested ecosystems as a function of variability in the physical climate system and environmental change.

AB Spectral vegetation Indices have been used extensively to predict ecological variables, such as percent vegetation cover, above-ground biomass, and leaf-area index. We examined the use of various vegetation indices and multiple linear regression using raw spectral bands for predicting vegetation cover in a landscape characterized by high variability in vegetation cover and soil properties. We were able to improve the explanatory value of several vegetation indices by using regression fitting techniques including log transformations and polynomial regressions. We expected soil-adjusted indices to perform better than nonadjusted indices. However, soil-adjusted vegetation indices based on a ratio of red and near-infrared bands explained 55-65% of the variability in vegetation cover, while two nonadjusted indices each explained 70%. An index using six spectral bands explained 40%. The best multiple regression model used the red and near-infrared bands and explained 75% of the variability in vegetation cover. Among the soil-adjusted indices, an index which used a computed soil line performed best. Ratio-based vegetation indices were less sensitive to shadow influences, but this influence was outweighed by the advantages of multiple regression against original bands.

AB Efficient compression techniques are required for the coding of hyperspectral data. Lossless compression is required in the transmission and storage of data within the distribution system. Lossy techniques have a role in the initial analysis of hyperspectral data where large quantities of data are evaluated to select smaller al-eas for more detailed evaluation. Central to lossy compression is the development of a suitable distortion measure, and this work discusses the applicability of extant measures in video coding to the compression of hyperspectral imagery. Criteria for a remote sensing distortion measure are developed and suitable distortion. measures are discussed One measure [the percentage maximum absolute distortion (PMAD) measure] is considered to be a suitable candidate for application to remotely sensed images. The effect of lossy compression is then investigated on the maximum likelihood classification of hyperspectral images, both directly on the original reconstructed data and on. features extracted by the decision boundary feature extraction (DBFE) technique. The effect of the PMAD measure is determined on the classification of an image reconstructed with varying degrees of distortion. Despite some anomalies caused by challenging discrimination tasks, the classification accuracy of both the total image and its constituent classes remains predictable as the level of distortion increases. Although total classification accuracy is reduced from 96.8% for the original image to 82.8% for the image compressed with 4% PMAD, the loss in accuracy is not significant (less that 8%) for most classes other than those that present a challenging classification problem. Yet the compressed image is 1/17 the size of the original. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The relation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the fraction of absorbed photo-synthetically active radiation (f(APAR)) was examined for ten different forest types by using the scattering-from-arbitrarily-inclined-leaves (SAIL) radiative transfer model. Leaf reflectance and transmittance, twig reflectance, and background reflectance data were collected as part of field experiments whose sites contain species whose ranges cover a significant part of western and northern North America. This provides a sense of variations that occur at continental scales. Actual backgrounds of forests include litter and mosses; these materials did not fall along a soil line in red-near infrared reflectance space. The simulations indicated that, at low values of the leaf area index (LAI), the background reflectance had a significant effect on the canopy reflectance, although little effect on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorption. At higher values of LAI, leaf optical properties were the factors that dominated canopy reflectance and NDVI. Variations in canopy reflectance due to leaf optical properties were large, but most species had similar reflectance patterns. Green leaf optical properties, among the species studied, had little effect on f(APAR). The presence of twigs in the canopy had a noticeable effect on canopy reflectance and absorption of PAR, but these effects were secondary to the effects of background and leaf optical properties.

ID ATMOSPHERIC CORRECTION; REFLECTANCE; ALGORITHM; RADIANCES
AB A complete set of advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data and ground-based measurements of aerosol and water-vapor content are used to test an algorithm for the retrieval of aerosol properties over dense vegetation in the red and over lake water in both the red and the near-infrared AVHRR channels. With the assumptions of a weak and reasonably constant surface reflectance and an appropriate aerosol model in the radiative transfer code, the remaining variance in the satellite signal is interpreted in terms of aerosol optical thickness. From theoretical computations, it appears that the algorithm is particularly sensitive to the surface albedo and that an uncertainty of 0.01 in reflectance leads to an error of +/-0.1 in the retrieved optical thickness. This theoretical estimate is confirmed by data acquired over a boreal forest region in Canada and over one of the Great Lakes (Ontario). In particular, channel 1 observations over vegetation in the forward scattering direction are well suited for retrievals because vegetation pixels appear darker owing to shadowing effects. Conversely, the forward scattering geometry over lakes introduces large errors in both channels owing to specular reflections (glint effects). Even for observations well removed from the forward scattering principal plane, lake surface reflections due to sky radiance glint have to be taken into account. Because the accuracy of the retrieval algorithm is affected by water-vapor absorption in channel 2 and by variations in lake-water turbidity in channel 1, the optimal retrieval configuration is to employ vegetation observations in channel 1. Bidirectional effects have to be considered, however, for observations in the backscatter directions. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Excellent data on deforestation have been obtained in the tropics with the use of high-resolution optical sensors. Yet, several problems remain. Cloud cover creates data gaps that limit the possibility of complete and frequent assessments, and secondary growth is not well characterized. Active microwave sensors could complement these sensors because they operate independently of cloud cover and smoke and can detect differences in woody biomass and forest structure associated with various stages of forest clearing and regrowth. An example of comparison and synergy between the two techniques is discussed here. Polarimetric, C- (5.6 cm) and L-band (24 cm) frequency, radar data gathered in October 1994 by NASA's Spaceborne Imaging Radar C, on a test site southeast of the city of Porto Velho, in the state of Rondonia, Brazil are analyzed in conjunction with one 1993 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene, a 9-year time series of Satellite pour l'observation de la Terre (SPOT) XS data, two Japan Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) radar images from 1994 and 1995, and a field visit conducted in 1995.
   The C-band radar data are found to be of limited utility for mapping deforestation. At L-band multiple polarizations are required to obtain a reliable classification. The single polarization, L-band, single date, JERS-1 data underestimate the extent of deforestation, especially during the wet season. With multiple polarizations, sit classes of land cover including one level of regrowth, are mapped with 90% accuracy, but intermediate regrowth 5-8 years of age is not well separated from the forest. The Landsat TM data identify deforested areas better but provide less information on residual woody biomass levels. Combining the two classifications, seven classes of land cover including two levels of regrowth are mapped with 93% accuracy. The results show that the deforestation rate for 1994 was 1.7%. Large variations in residual woody biomass are detected among new clearings. Half of the total deforested land is in some stage of regrowth, but most of it is less than 5 years old. Secondary growth is therefore a significant form of land use that is recleared quickly. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID SPECTROSCOPY; SCATTERING; MEDIA
AB The Hapke bidirectional reflectance model has been widely used for soil modeling, but gives significant errors when the soil scatters very strongly and anisotropically. In our new model, we decompose the radiation field into three components instead of two: single-scattering radiance, double-scattering radiance, and multiple-scattering radiance. The first two components can be exactly calculated and multiple scattering is equivalently approximated by the original Hapke formula. Comparisons with the numerical code-DISORT based on the discrete ordinate algorithm indicate that this modified model significantly improves the accuracy of the bidirectional reflectance. A numerical calculation for a clay soil using the Mie theory gives reasonable variation in the ranges of the single-scattering albedo and the asymmetry parameter of the phase function where the original Hapke model generally works poorly. An inversion experiment shows that the modified model also improves the inversion accuracy.

AB A simple algorithm based on a rough surface scattering model teas developed to invert the bare soil moisture content from active microwave remote sensing data. In the algorithm development, a frequency mixing model was used to relate soil moisture to the dielectric constant. In particular, the Integral Equation Model (IEM) was used over a wide range of surface roughness and radar frequencies. To derive the algorithm, a sensitivity analysis was performed using a Monte Carlo simulation to study the effects of surface parameters, including height variance, correlation length, and dielectric constant. Because radar return is inherently dependent on both moisture content and surface roughness, the purpose of the sensitivity testing was to select the proper radar parameters so as to optimal by decouple these two factors, in an attempt to minimize the effects of one while the other was observed. As a result, the optimal radar parameter ranges can be chosen for the purpose of soil moisture content inversion. One thousand samples were then generated with the IEM model followed by multivariate linear regression analysis to obtain an empirical soil moisture model. Numerical comparisons were made to illustrate the inversion performance using experimental measurements. Results indicate that the present algorithm is simple and accurate, and can be a useful tool for the remote sensing of bare soil surfaces.

AB Retrieving area estimates from coarse spatial resolution land-cover maps is generally inaccurate due to the effect of spatial aggregation on class proportions. The objective of this study was to build a correction function with respect to proportional errors in order to estimate tropical forest areas from coarse resolution classifications. Previous studies have shown that the errors in the estimation of land-cover proportions depends on the spatial resolution of the map, the initial proportions of the landscape in the different land covers, and the spatial arrangement of the land covers at the initial resolution. The interaction between the proportional errors produced by spatial aggregation and the spatial pattern of cover types has been modeled in an operational way at a broad spatial scab. A correction function has been calibrated on the basis of tropical forest maps derived; from AVHRR 1 km data for the entire intertropical belt and a nonrandom sample of 13 Landsat TM scenes well distributed among the main tropical forest regions. The calibration model integrates a measure of the spatial fragmentation of the landscape in a two-step procedure. This calibration procedure improves by 25.5% the reliability of the retrieval of proportions of cover types from coarse resolution data by comparison to a simple correction function relating directly proportions at coarse and fine resolutions. The final coefficient of determination, of the model is 0.789.

AB Active and passive microwave remote sensing techniques have demonstrated their potential for measurements of soil moisture. However, the soil moisture response fi-om them is coupled to vegetation and surface roughness effects, and therefore the interaction among all three needs to be understood. This paper reviews the progress made in the measurement of soil moisture and the factors such as vegetation and surface roughness that affect these measurements. The active techniques, particularly those employing synthetic aperture radar (SAR), provide opportunities for soil moisture studies over a large area, and various aircraft and space missions have been carried out to achieve them. Still, there are unresolved questions about deriving soil moisture from these missions, and research is underway to develop algorithms so that soil moisture information can be obtained on a focal as well as a global basis.

AB Terrestrial net primary production (NPP) is sensitive to a number of controls, including aspects of climate, topography, soils, plant and microbial characteristics, disturbance, and anthropogenic impacts. Yet, at least at the global scale, models based on very different types and numbers of parameters yield similar results. Part of the reason for this is that the major NPP controls influence each other, resulting, under current conditions, in broad correlations among controls. NPP models that include richer suites of controlling parameters should be more sensitive to conditions that disrupt the broad correlations, but the current paucity of global data limits the power of complex models. Improved data sets will facilitate applications of complex models, but many of the critical data are very difficult to produce, especially for applications dealing with the past or future. It may be possible to overcome some of the challenges of data availability through increased understanding and modeling of ecological processes that adjust plant physiology and architecture in relation to resources. The CASA (Carnegie, Stanford, Ames Approach) model introduced by Potter et al. (1993) and expanded here uses a combination of ecological principles, satellite data, and surface data to predict terrestrial NPP on a monthly time step. CASA calculates NPP as a product of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, APAR, and an efficiency of radiation use, E. The underlying postulate is that some of the limitations on NPP appear in each. CASA estimates annual terrestrial NPP to be 48 Pg and the maximum efficiency of PAR utilization (epsilon*) to be 0.39 g C MJ(-1) PAR. Spatial and temporal variation in APAR is more than fivefold greater than variation in epsilon.

AB Shortwave radioative fluxes at the earth's surface are of primary interest in climate research because they control the total energy exchange between the atmosphere and the land/ocean surface. Information on these fluxes is needed on a global scale, and therefore, has to be obtained by methods of remote sensing from observations made with instruments carried on satellites. The primary objective of this paper is to review current capabilities and activities to infer these forcing functions from satellite observations and to discuss future needs. Discussed will be fluxes of downward surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) and net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR), Methods for deriving DSSR fluxes on a global scale are becoming operational. They are being used increasingly to address climate issues, such as in determining the role of solar forcing in oceanic and atmospheric processes, hydrological modeling, and in carbon cycling. Based on extensive comparisons with ground-truth it is believed that estimates of DSSR fluxes can be obtained within 20 Wm(-2) or better on monthly time scales, for areas of an average climate model grid size. Methods for deriving NSSR fluxes seem promising, but need to be further evaluated.

AB Knowledge of the directional reflectance properties of natural surfaces such as soils and vegetation canopies is essential for classification studies and canopy model inversion. Atmospheric correction schemes, using various levels of approximation, are described to retrieve surface bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) and directional-hemispherical reflectances (albedos)from multiangle radiance measurements taken at ground level. The retrieval schemes are tested on simulated data incorporating realistic surface BRFs and atmospheric models containing aerosols. Sensitivity of the atmospherically corrected BRFs and associated directional-hemispherical reflectances to various aerosol properties and the sun-view geometry is illustrated. A measurement strategy for obtaining highly accurate surface reflectance properties also is examined in the context of instrument radiometric calibration, knowledge of the atmospheric properties, and sun-view angular coverage.

ID LEAVES; LIGHT
AB A new type of VIRAF spectrometer (Visible Infrared Reflectance Absorptance Fluorescence), the VIRAF II, is presented The VIRAF spectrometer has been developed and constructed for ground truthing of remote sensing of terrestrial vegetation and for other types of ecophysiological measurements. It is a multipurpose instrument with the capability to measure reflectance, absorptance, and fluorescence in the visible and near-infrared (400-910 nm). The Position of the sample is unchanged throughout the measurements, which guarantees a good comparison between the different types of spectra. since leaf samples can be left intact and attached to the plant, real in vivo measurements as well as long-term and repetitive studies using different addition techniques can be carried out. In contrast to conventional spectrometers, the sample is illuminated with strong white (or blue) light and only a narrow angle of the reflected, transmitted or emitted light is detected. This mimics the outdoor situation in remote sensing Furthermore, the strong light maintains the physiological activity of the leaf sample. The new VIRAF II described here has a diode array detector and a shutter which enables to measure within 20 ms. This opens the possibility for studies of kinetic changes in the range of seconds or minutes. Results are presented from a comparison of light green leaves of an Aurea mutant and dark green leaves of a wildtype tobacco plant (Nicotiana tabacum L.). The data are interpreted in terms of difference in chlorophyll concentration, leaf tissue structure, epidermis structure, and photosynthetic activity. Slight differences between the 20-ms reflectance spectra of a dark-adapted leaf taken directly after onset of illumination and after 60 s or 180 s of continuous illumination (decrease between 650 nm and 800 nm and increase between 400 nm and 600 nm) may be attributed to changes of the chlorohyll fluorescence and to chloroplast movements, respectively, reflecting physiological activity of the sample.

AB In this article, the variability of the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the daily interception efficiency (epsilon(i)) of a discontinuous canopy is investigated using a simple radiative transfer model developed for regular-clumped crops. Sensitivity to the canopy and irradiance parameters is first studied for 1) the relationship between epsilon(i) and LAI and 2) the relationship between NDVI and LAI. The analysis is conducted varying one parameter at a time to provide an understanding of the influence of that variable on the behavior of the relationships. Next, with the same procedure, the relationship between epsilon(i) and NDVI is investigated. This investigation focuses on the sensitivity of the relationship to the structural parameters and its linearity. It shows that for most of the semiarid vegetation types, characterized by low LAI and bright background, the epsilon(i)-NDVI relationship could be simplified to a linear relation with an abscissa offset equal to the normalized difference vegetation index of the background (NDVI(s)): epsilon(i) = a(NDVI - NDVI(s)). Further studies show that 1) the more the canopy is discontinuous, the more the slope a is sensitive to the solar zenith angle, 2) the slope a tends to a unique value 1.3 as the canopy tends to a homogeneous medium, and 3) the relative standard error of epsilon(i) is time-dependent (minimum at theta(s) = 30-degrees) and all the higher as the structure of the canopy is unknown. The relevance of these investigations to satellite data is then discussed, resulting in long-term recommendations as satellite orbital characteristics providing the optimal geometric irradiance for epsilon(i) estimation, or additional new sensors providing complementary information about the canopy. At short term, further epsilon(i)-NDVI sensitivity analyses are encouraged, especially for other types of discontinuous canopies and off-nadir viewing.

DT Article
AB The remote detection of permafrost (perennially frozen ground) has important implications to environmental resource development, engineering studies, natural hazard prediction, and climate change research. In this study, we present results from two experiments into the classification of permafrost active layer depth within the zone of discontinuous permafrost in northern Canada. A new software system (MERCURY+) based on evidential reasoning was implemented to permit the integrated classification of multisource data consisting of landcover, terrain aspect, and equivalent latitude (potential insolation), each of which possessed different formats, data types, or statistical properties that could not be handled by conventional classification algorithms available to this study. In the first experiment, four active layer depth classes were classified using ground based measurements of the three variables with an accuracy of 83% compared to in situ soil probe determination Of permafrost active layer depth at over 500 field sites. This confirmed the environmental significance of the variables selected, and provided a baseline result to which a remote sensing classification could be compared. In the second experiment, evidence for each input variable was obtained from image processing of digital SPOT imagery and a photogrammetric digital elevation model, and used to classify active layer depth with an accuracy of 79%. These results suggest the classification of evidence from remotely sensed measures of spectral response and topography may provide suitable indicators of permafrost active layer depth.

AB Field measurements Of carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes were analyzed in conjunction with reflectances obtained from a helicopter-mounted Modular Multiband Radiometer (MMR) at a grassland study site during the First ISLSCP (International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project) Field Experiment (FIFE). These measurements are representative of the canopy scale and were made over a range of meteorological and soil moisture conditions during different stages in the annual life cycle of the prairie vegetation, and thus provide a good basis for investigating hypotheses/relationships potentially useful in remote sensing applications. We tested the hypothesis (Sellers, 1987) that the simple ratio vegetation index (SR) should be near-linearly related to the derivatives of the unstressed canopy stomatal conductance (g*c) and the unstressed canopy photosynthesis (P*c) with respect to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Even though there is some scatter in our data, the results seem to support this hypothesis. Further investigation, however, is needed before such relationships can be employed in satellite remote sensing applications

AB A laboratory goniometer was used to measure the light scattered from leaves as a function of view angle in the principal plane for yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.), red oak (Quercus rubra L), and red maple (Acer rubrum L.). The source was a parallel-polarized helium-neon laser (632.8 nm). Yellow poplar leaves had the highest reflectance of the three species, which may have been due to its shorter palisade cells and more extensive spongy mesophyll. Prior to senescence, there was a significant decrease, but not total extinction, in the reflectance of the beam incident at 600 from nadir on the adaxial (upper) side of the leaves of all three species. This was interpreted as a Brewster angle effect. The reflectance increased as the leaves senesced. The abaxial (lower) side of the leaf did not exhibit the reflectance decrease at the Brewster angle, indicating that multiple reflections were obscuring the effect. The multiple reflections could have been from either the spongy mesophyll or from the abaxial surface (which was rougher than the adaxial). Low-temperature scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations showed differences in the surface wax patterns among the three species but did not indicate a cause of the reflectance changes other than possibly the accumulation and aging of the wax. SEM observations confirmed the greater roughness of the abaxial side of the leaf. This type of information on leaf bidirectional scattering should be useful for linking remote sensing observations with leaf optical properties.

TI NORTHEAST NORTH PACIFIC-OCEAN - SURFACE CURRENT PATTERN SHIFTS DURING
   THE SPRING
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CALIFORNIA CURRENT SYSTEM; BOUNDARY
AB This work is a study of the interaction of the wind and the sea where easterly moving geostrophic flow becomes eastern boundary currents. To be as synoptic as possible, a satellite time series study (1983-1989) and an oceanographic survey (1989) concentrated on the Pacific Ocean surface waters adjacent to the northwest coast of North America. The hypothesis tested was that the changes in temperature contours of the sea surface infer a shift in current patterns. Of special interest are the surface current patterns during the spring transitional period (1 March-15 June). This is the time when the California current begins to dominate the eastern boundary currents, and biological production increases. At this time, the predominant wind patterns over the North Pacific change. These changes affect the water masses where the West Wind Drift becomes the California Current. By using the Advanced very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) aboard NOAA's polar orbiter satellites, a pattern of current shifts over time is measurable. The results from analyzing 53 images over 7 years show a noticeable and distinct shift in surface temperature pattern during the spring period. This pattern shift was visible over time and space, and reflects the effect of the wind in changing the pattern of surface water current flow. Although limited in time and space, the ship-deployed instruments, also, reflect these changes and allow a look at the physical processes in the mixed layer.

AB Spectral shifts characterized by the wavelength lambda(i) of the inflexion point in the red-edge region (670-780 nm) are analyzed using model simulations. Leaf optical properties are computed with the PROSPECT model, canopy reflectance with the SAIL model, and atmospheric effects with the 5S model. The information provided by the high spectral resolution index (lambda(i)) appears to be equivalent to that obtained from the red and near-infrared broad band reflectances at leaf level. This is not true at canopy level:  lambda(i) is very sensitive to leaf area index and chlorophyll concentration and, when observed from space sensors, it minimizes the effects of atmosphere and soil background optical properties. Moreover, lambda(i) could be a pertinent indicator of canopy photosynthetic capacity. But its small dynamic range requires further studies in which sensor noise has to be considered, depending on the method of lambda(i) computation.

TI APPLICATION OF TERRESTRIAL THERMOGRAPHY TO THE DETECTION OF
   WASTE-DISPOSAL SITES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The experiment presented here concerns the application of terrestrial thermography to the detection of potential anomalies in waste-disposal sites, defined differently according to their degree of waste stabilization and pollution. A thermal camera, operating in the middle infrared (3.5-5.6-mu-m) region, was used to test a methodology for identifying different waste sites, by means of their thermal contrast. A sequence of six data sets concerning various target types was taken during a complete descending thermal diurnal cycle. Additional meteorological and radiometric data sets were collected during surveys for the calibration of thermographies and computation of emissivity values. Good thermal differentiation was observed between the consolidated solid waste and the waste sections where processes of methane conversion are active, and between water surfaces with acid slimes and the uncontaminated outcropping water table. The best contrasts were observed during predawn conditions, when uniformities of air and ground temperature were high and the influence of solar charge was negligible. A constant 2 K temperature difference was observed as a surficial anomaly between differently consolidated waste sections and a 6 K temperature as a maximum difference outlining waters affected by wasting agents. The experiment, carried out at the waste disposal site of Gerenzano (Varese), Italy, verified the feasibility of using aerial thermography in the future and of extending the results achieved to other sites under similar conditions.

AB Remotely sensed data can be used to estimate successfully the concentration of sediment in water.  Such estimation has relied on relationships between suspended sediment concentration (SSC) and radiation in one or two broad wavebands where it is assumed that the effects of environmental variability (irradiance, subpixel cloud, etc.) are either small, or can be considered as spectrally additive constants in all wavebands.  Where these assumptions do not hold, an alternative and theoretically more robust relationship is proposed, that between SSC and derivative radiation (change in radiation per unit wavelength).  Measurements of spectral reflectance (R(lambda)), derivative spectral reflectance (DR(lambda)) and SSC were measured in the laboratory, where the effects of environmental variability were small and at sea where the effects of environmental variability were large.  There was a strong correlation between SSC and DR(lambda) both in the laboratory (max R2 = -0.98) and at sea (max R2 = -0.83) and DR(lambda) was used to estimate SSC in the laboratory to an error of less than 8% of the mean SSC.  The correlation between R(lambda) and SSC was weaker at sea (max R2 = 0.46) than in the laboratory (max R2 = 0.96).  This was due to the presence of large and spectrally variable environmental effects.  We recommend the use of derivative spectra for the estimation of SSC when continuous spectra are available.

TI A HOTSPOT MODEL FOR LEAF CANOPIES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID AUTO-CORRELATION; DIGITAL IMAGES; REFLECTANCE; REGULARIZATION
AB The interaction between radiation and structured land surfaces is a key element in remote sensing. A fundamental property of this interaction is the way the observed radiance of a remotely-sensed scene changes with the source and viewer geometry. This variation depends on land surface type and structure and may provide a means for mapping and monitoring the structure and its changes through remote sensing. Among the effects which occur as source and observer geometry change is the hotspot effect. The canopy hotspot occurs when the source and viewer are aligned so that there is no visible shadow, and thus the scene appears bright. The magnitude and behavior of this phenomenon as viewing and illumination positions change provides important information about canopy structure. In particular, the angular change in brightness is a function of the relative size and spacing of objects making up the canopy. In this paper, the hotspot effect is modeled using general principles of environmental physics as driven by parameters of interest in remote sensing, such as leaf size, leaf shape, leaf area index, and leaf angle distribution. Specific examples are derived for canopies of horizontal leaves. Finally, the hotspot effect is implemented in the framework of the Suits model for a canopy of leaves to illustrate what might occur in an agricultural crop. Because the hotspot effect arises from very basic geometrical principles and is scale-free, it occurs similarly in woodlands, forests, crops, rough soil surfaces, and clouds.

AB Nadir spectral reflectances for a range of grass-land conditions on the Konza prairie in Kansas were acquired in 1987 from June to October during the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment, or FIFE. Measurements in the red (0.668 +/- 0.005-mu-m) and near-infrared (0.821 +/- 0.006-mu-m) were obtained at numerous solar zenith angles (SZAs) during the diurnal cycle. Reflectance factors were utilized for computation of two spectral vegetation indices (VIs) - the simple ratio (SR) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The diurnal change in the narrow red and near-infrared bands and their VIs as a function of SZA, and the relationship of these spectral data to biophysical measurements, were examined throughout the growing season. The assumption of independence of VIs from illumination geometry was specifically addressed. Both the SR and the NDVI were significantly affected by SZA for many prairie conditions. SR was significantly related to more canopy variables over a wider SZA range (27-degrees-61-degrees) than was NDVI. For intermediate green LAI (0.5 < LAI < 2.0), both indices were at a minimum value at solar noon, increasing with SZA. Conversely, the higher biomass sites (LAI > 2.0) with especially tall grass exhibited either a maximum value at solar noon which decreased as SZA increased or a moderate to high constant VI. Low density canopies (LAI < 0.5) exhibited no change in their low VI values over the diurnal course. These qualitatively different responses precluded the use of a general "correction" to remove the observed SZA effects on the measured VI values. The strength of the relationships between VI and LAI also varied, depending on SZA, with lower predictive capability at the traditionally used "high sun" condition than at oblique sun angles (SZA > 40-degrees). The restriction of surface measurements to a standard acquisition SZA of 45-degrees produced a good correspondence of both the SR and NDVI to LAI (r2 = 0.69). The best predictive linear model for the SR was obtained at SZA = 45-degrees (r2 = 0.82) and was based on two canopy variables, the green LAI and the canopy standing green to standing dead dry weight ratio. Therefore, a standard SZA for data acquisitions at 45-degrees is recommended over the traditional "high sun" practice. The results suggest that the VIs measure the instantaneous, projected, and illuminated LAI canopy fraction relative to the illuminated substrate.

AB The possibilities of crop parameter estimation from X-band radar backscattering measurements were investigated using empirical and simple physical relationships.  The study used ground-based, multitemporal, multiangle, and copolarized radar data.  The investigated crops were beet, potato, wheat, and barley.  The investigated crop parameters were dry canopy biomass, amount of crop water, soil cover, and crop height.  The implications of the results and recommendations for further research were discussed.  Empirical relations and the "cloud" equations were inapt for accurate estimations of crop parameters from X-band radar data at one state of copolarization and one angle of incidence.  The use of both vertical and horizontal copolarized radar data did not improve the estimation accuracy.  The use of both a medium and a high angle of incidence improved the estimation accuracy of the amount of crop water in the early growing season of (only) beet.  The use of more angles of incidence did not further improve the estimation accuracy.  The low estimation accuracies were attributed to specific features of the X-band (early saturation, low soil-crop contrast), and to the simplicity of the mono / bivariate inversion schemes used.

AB A brief description of a new forest reflectance model is given.  As model input parameters, several ordinary forest mensuration parameters can be used.  Results from model calculations compared with those from reflectance measurements with an airborne radiometer for 12 Scots pine-dominated boreal forests in Estonia have shown a rather good agreement in the red region both in summer and winter conditions.  The coincidence is the poorest in the green and near infrared regions in summer.  In winter with the snow-covered grounds, in spite of the acceptable r2 values of the respective linear regression, there tends to be systematic overestimation of simulated reflectance values.  Further tests of the model are needed to confirm its ability to predict the relations of forest reflectance with most important structural and optical model input parameters.

AB Total hemispherical shortwave reflectance (albedo) is a major parameter of interest for studies of land surface climatology and global change.  Efforts to estimate albedo from remote sensing data have been constrained by the available instrumentation that typically provide observations of reflected radiance from a single view direction in narrow spectral bands.  However, the capability to obtain multiple angle observations over the shortwave region is planned for Earth Observing System sensors.  In this paper, methods for estimating albedo from multiple angle, discrete wavelength band radiometer measurements are examined.  The methods include a numerical integration technique and the integration of an empirically derived equation for bidirectional reflectance.  The validity of the described techniques is examined by comparing albedo computed from multiband radiometer data with simultaneously acquired pyranometer data from vegetated and bare soil surfaces.  Shortwave albedo estimated from both techniques agree favorably with the independent pyranometer measurements.  Absolute root mean square errors were 0.5% or less for both grass sod and bare soil surfaces.

TI RADIOMETRIC RECTIFICATION - TOWARD A COMMON RADIOMETRIC RESPONSE AMONG
   MULTIDATE, MULTISENSOR IMAGES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID LANDSAT MSS DATA; REFLECTANCE
AB A common radiometric response is required for quantitative analysis of multiple satellite images of a scene acquired on different dates with different sensors.  We describe a technique to "radiometrically rectify" multiple Landsat images of a scene to a reference image, and evaluate it using a pair of Landsat 5 images acquired 2 years apart.  All rectified images should appear as if they were acquired with the same sensor, while observing through the atmospheric and illumination conditions of the reference image.  If atmospheric optical depth and sensor calibration data are available for the reference image, then an atmospheric correction algorithm may be used to correct all the rectified images to absolute surface reflectance.  The "radiometric rectification" algorithm identifies "radiometric control sets," i.e., sets of scene landscape elements with a mean reflectance which is expected to change little with time.  The average digital count values of these radiometric control sets are used to calculate linear transforms relating digital count values between images.  We evaluate the technique empirically with a pair of Landsat 5 TM images of a scene for which surface reflectance and atmospheric optical depth data are available.  We also examine its performance under a wide range of atmospheric conditions using simulations based on atmospheric models.  We find that the radiometric rectification algorithm performed well for the visible and near infrared bands, adjusting surface reflectance for the effects of relative atmospheric differences to within 1%.  The performance is not as good for the midinfrared bands on TM.  There are several possible causes for this; we could not determine which was the most important.  We conclude from these studies that for scenes containing reflectance stable elements, radiometric rectification should be a useful alternative to atmospheric radiative transfer codes and sensor calibration approaches when reliable atmospheric optical depth data or calibration coefficients are not available.  When atmospheric optical data and sensor calibration information are available for one of a sequence of radiometrically rectified images, an atmospheric radiative transfer code may be used to correct each image in the sequence to absolute surface reflectance.

TI SEMIVARIOGRAMS OF DIGITAL IMAGERY FOR ANALYSIS OF CONIFER CANOPY
   STRUCTURE
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID PHYSICAL-GEOGRAPHY; GEOSTATISTICS; VARIOGRAMS
AB Semivariograms were used to exploit the spatial information inherent in digital imagery of a variety of Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco] forest stands in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Calculations involved digital numbers from single transects of pixels representative of each stand and from a full spatial matrix of pixels from each stand. Digitized aerial video images having pixel sizes of 1 m, 10 m, and 30 m were used. At 1 m spatial resolution the ranges of the matrix semivariograms related to the mean tree canopy sizes of the stands. The sills responded to the presence of vertical layering in the canopies and to percent canopy cover. The transect semivariograms were less representative of overall stand structure, but exhibited periodicity that was suggestive of patterns in stand structure. Semivariograms based on 10 m and 30 m pixels contained significantly less useful information. The ranges of the 10 m matrix semivariograms revealed only whether the tree canopy sizes were less than 10 m or were between 10 m and 20 m. The sills were greatly reduced, but still related well to canopy layering and percent cover. Periodicity in the transect semivariograms was greatly reduced, and in some cases, eliminated. At 30 m resolution, only the sills of the matrix semivariograms contained useful information. However, actual differences between the sills were small.

AB Recent studies have highlighted that meltwater in supraglacial lakes (SLs) can be buried during frozen season in the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). Meltwater in buried lakes (BLs) can even persist through the winter, disturbing the englacial thermal regime and providing an important buffer against GrIS's contribution to sea-level rise. However, little is known about the inter-annual BL dynamics in the GrIS, and there is no quantitative statistic about the overall buried percentage. Here, we conduct a satellite-based study to automatically map the winter BLs over the GrIS during 2017-2022 using multi-source optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. To eliminate the interferences from other weak microwave reflecting surfaces, summer SLs are first extracted from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images to determine the potential BL searching areas on winter Sentinel-1 images. A self-adaptive thresholding algorithm is proposed to extract BLs within the dilated summer SLs using histogram-based morphological edge detectors. BLs extracted by the proposed method and visual interpretation show a substantial agreement with a precision of 0.82 and a Kappa coefficient of 0.70. On average, a total buried lake area of 182.27 km2 was observed each winter during the period 2017-2022. BLs were mainly distributed in the Center-West, South-West and North-East Basins, with the majority occurring at elevations between 800 and 1700 m. In 2019-2020, a sudden extension of BLs was observed over the GrIS, especially in the North-East Basin where abnormally high temperatures and surface runoff were recorded. In 2021-2022, a widespread distribution of BLs in the South-West Basin was observed after abnormal snowfall. Overall, about 13% of the GrIS summer SLs can persist through winter, suggesting the potential for meltwater hydrofracture in winter over large areas.

AB A catastrophic landslide occurred on 21 July 2020, 30 km from Enshi city, in Mazhe County of Hubei province, China. In this paper, we aimed to investigate the kinematic evolution and volumetric change related to this landslide using multi-source remote sensing measurements from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data. C-band Sentinel-1 and X-band TerraSAR-X SAR data are analyzed using several multi-temporal interferometry (MTI) time-series techniques including Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), Small Baseline subset (SBAS), and Combined eigenvalue maximum likelihood Phase Linking (CPL). The spatial pattern of surface deformation resulting from the interferometric analysis is then statistically analyzed to retrieve the pre-failure and post-failure displacements. Co-failure motions are analyzed using an image correlation technique applied to both the Planetscope and Sentinel-2 images. Moreover, 4 pairs of bistatic TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TDX) data are utilized to generate high-precision digital elevation models (DEMs) and estimate the volumetric change related to the main slope failure.The pre-failure ground deformation analysis results suggest that the landslide was already active before the July 2020 failure, with the seasonality and hydraulic diffusivity being characteristics of a slow-moving landslide. Among the three different MTI methods applied, the CPL method results in a greater measurement points (MPs) density than the PSI and SBAS method when estimating the pre-failure movement of the Shaziba landslide. The July 2020 Shaziba disaster is divided into three main parts: (1) slightly horizontal deformation of 0.5-1.5 m within the northern part with ground and house cracks, (2) less collapse in the eastern part with horizontal motions reaching 30 m and (3) a highly eroded western part where vegetation was wholly lost in the main event, resulting in an collapse volume of approximately 4.98 million m3, out of which approximately around 3.4 million m3 was deposited and approximately 1.58 million m3 was washed away into the Qing River. After the failure, the marginal scrap of the main failure body, above crown of landslide and eastern part showed instability with rates of 20-30 mm/yr, suggesting that the failure zone may continue to expand.

AB Surface upwelling longwave radiation (SULR) is a major component of the Earth's radiation budget and directly influences the retrieval of evapotranspiration (ET) in the terrestrial ecosystems. Land surface temperature (LST) is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) for direct estimation of SULR. However, accurate retrieval of SULR from satellite observations may be severely hindered by the anisotropic properties of land surface targets since most of them show marked angular variations in LST. This study aims at investigating the magnitude and impact factors of the directional effects of LST on SULR estimation over vegetated surfaces given that angular variation in emissivity has a limited impact on SULR estimation over most land surface types. It follows an attempt to correct for such effects in SULR estimation. We further explore the possibility to find a viewing direction at which SULR estimated from the directional LST can surrogate the hemispherical integration. To do so, a parametric model mimicking LST anisotropy with the hot spot is incorporated into the physical temperature-emissivity method. Two widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products (i.e., MYD11_L2 and MYD21_L2) are analyzed. SULR estimates before and after correcting for LST directionality are compared with insitu measurements acquired at 15 sites from the FLUXNET and SURFRAD networks in different regions. Our analysis reveals that LST directional effects on SULR estimation exhibit diurnal and seasonal variations, which are substantial in spring and summer for the daytime. The effects are negligible (<5 W m  2) in autumn and winter for the daytime except for in arid and semiarid regions. For the night-time, the effects are insignificant over all the biomes. Using MYD21 LST, after correction, the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) and bias of SULR estimates for all sites decrease by 8 and 8.34 W m  2 in spring, and by 8.9 and 12.13 W m  2 in summer. Using MYD11 LST, after correction, the average RMSE is between 10 and 15 W m  2 and the average bias is close to zero in all seasons. The RMSE and absolute bias of SULR estimates for sites with low to moderate vegetation (LAI <3) is lowered substantially (7-14 W m  2) after correction. Interestingly, SULR estimates from LST viewed at 54 degrees backward and hemispherically integrated are close, with differences <3 W m  2 at most of the sites. These findings support a strategy for SULR estimation in ET retrieval over vegetated surfaces from directional LST.

AB Clumping describes the spatial distribution of foliage elements (leaves or needles) within a vegetation canopy. Clumping information is important for determining the radiation transfer through canopies, photosynthesis, and hydrological processes. Clumping of needles in shoots in conifer stands has posed a challenge because optical instruments have generally been incapable of measuring gaps between needles within a shoot. Previous methods for estimating the needle-to-shoot-area ratio have had in common destructive and/or highly labor-intensive aspects. We introduce blue light 3D photogrammetry scanning as a highly efficient technique for estimating shoot-level clumping, which significantly reduces the labor intensity aspect of the previous approaches. We validate the approach by comparing it to the combined photographic/volume displacement method - an established methodology for quantifying shoot-level clumping. We used shoots of two species -Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst.) -collected from trees in the Ja center dot rvselja RAdiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) pine stand in Estonia. The needle-to-shoot area ratio values were similar to those measured using the traditional combined photographic/volume displacement method. The demonstrated effectiveness and performance of the blue light 3D photogrammetry scanning method shall lead to more frequent actual measurements of 3D shoot structures. Growth in knowledge about this most elementary yet often over-looked level of foliage clumping in canopies shall improve coniferous forest 3D radiative transfer modeling.

AB Floods are one of the most devastating natural calamities affecting millions of people and causing damage all around the globe. Flood models and remote sensing imagery are often used to predict and understand flooding. An increasing number of earth observation satellites are producing data at a rate that far outpaces our ability to manually extract meaningful information from it, motivating a surge in research on automatic feature detection in satellite imagery using machine learning and deep learning algorithms to automate flood mapping so that information from large streams of data can be extracted in near-real time and used for disaster response at landscape scale. The development of such an algorithm is predicated on exposure to training datasets that are representative of the full range of diversity in the spatial and spectral signature of surface water as it is sampled by space-based instruments. To address these needs, we developed a semantically labeled dataset of high-resolution multispectral imagery (Maxar WorldView 2/3) strategically sampled to be representative of North American surface water variability along five spatiotemporal strata: latitude, topographic complexity, land use, and day of year. This dataset was utilized to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically detect inundation extents using the Deep Earth Learning, Tools, and Analysis (DELTA) framework, an open source TensorFlow/Keras interpreter for satellite imagery. Our research objective was to demonstrate the out-of-sample accuracy of our trained CNN at landscape scale. The model performed well, with 98% precision and 94% recall for the water class during validation. We then evaluated the accuracy of our satellite-derived flood maps from trained machine learning model against a hydraulic model. For this, we compared predicted inundation extents against the USGS Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) Program's flood map library at 17 different locations, where the FIM library provides flood inundation extents based on hydraulic models built for river reaches and corre-sponding to stage measurements at a nearby USGS gaging site. Compared to the hydraulic model, we estimated the underprediction of flood inundation by optical remote sensing data in our areas of interest to be 62%. We used land use data from National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and cloud masks to estimate that 79% of underprediction was due to these obstructions, with 74% belonging to vegetation, 9% to clouds, and 4% to both. A significant amount of inundation is missed when only optical remote sensing data is considered, and we suggest the use of flood models along with remote sensing data for getting the most realistic flood inundation extents.

AB Global climate change is projected to increase the severity and duration of droughts across many regions of the world, which could push ecosystems across their tipping points. To protect the most vulnerable ecosystems, it is critical to understand if ecosystems are likely to collapse rapidly or have a certain buffer capacity with aggra-vating drought (as characterized by their onset, duration and severity). However, such ecosystem vulnerability has been rarely characterized. Here, we present a novel, multi-faceted approach to quantify the ecosystem vulnerability and associated impacts of drought characteristics across different ecosystems at the continental -scale in Europe using high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data. We observed substantially different vulnerabilities across ecosystems where the vegetation damage increases with earlier, longer and more intense droughts. In particular, irrigated croplands are under prominently high risk when facing intensified droughts with the shortest delay in response to drought (0.67 times that of other ecosystems) and a fast increase in damage to drought (1.27 times that of other ecosystems). Mixed forests have a prominently low vulnerability in terms of a notably slow increase in damage to drought (0.67 times that of other ecosystems) and a relatively long response time (longer than over half ecosystems). Moreover, the vulnerability of most ecosystems largely increases with increasing drought severity. Consequently, vegetation tends to succumb more quickly to intensified droughts. Our multi-faceted approach to ecosystem vulnerability characterization indicates that under future intensified droughts in the 21st century, the functioning of a vast range of ecosystems will be threatened.

AB Multi-sensor satellite images often show recurrent image slicks in the Baltic Sea. Based on historical reports, laboratory experiments, and spectral diagnostics, these image slicks are determined to be caused by pine (Pinus sylvestris) pollen aggregations as opposed to surface scums of cyanobacteria or other floating matters. This attribution is because the reflectance spectral shapes of these image slicks resemble those of pollen grains, which are all different from other floating matters. They all show rapid reflectance increase from -400 to -500 nm, beyond which the reflectance shape appears to plateau. During the 22-year period of 2000-2021, satellite images indicated large amounts of pollen grains in 14 years, with the earliest day being May 10 (in 2000) and the latest day being June 16 (in 2006). The longest duration in a single year is 22 days, from May 12 to June 2 of 2018. The waters containing pollen grains have expanded significantly in recent years, encompassing nearly the entire Baltic Sea. Because pollen grains contain a significant amount of carbon and have distinctive optical properties from other particles, these findings have significant implications on carbon sequestration, marine ecology, biooptics, ocean color calibration/validation, and remote sensing of marine debris.

AB Precisely measuring the Earth's changing surface on decadal to centennial time scales is critical for many science and engineering applications, yet long-term records of quantitative landscape change are often temporally and geographically sparse. Archives of scanned historical aerial photographs provide an opportunity to augment these records with accurate elevation measurements that capture the historical state of the Earth surface. Structure from Motion (SfM) photogrammetry workflows produce high-quality digital elevation models (DEMs) and orthoimage mosaics from these historical images, but time-intensive tasks like manual image preprocessing (e.g., fiducial marker identification) and ground control point (GCP) selection impede processing at scale. We developed an automated method to process historical images and generate self-consistent time series of high-resolution (0.5-2 m) DEMs and orthomosaics, without manual GCP selection. The method relies on SfM to correct camera interior and exterior orientation and a robust multi-stage co-registration approach using modern reference terrain datasets for geolocation refinement. We demonstrate the method using scanned images from the North American Glacier Aerial Photography (NAGAP) archive collected between 1967 and 1997. We present results for two sites with variable photo acquisition geometry and overlap - Mount Baker and South Cascade Glacier in Washington State, USA. The automated method corrects initial camera position errors of several kilometers and produces accurately georeferenced, high-resolution DEMs and orthoimages, regardless of camera configuration, acquisition geometry, terrain characteristics, and reference DEM properties. The average RMS reprojection error following bundle adjustment optimization was 0.67 px (0.15 m) for the 261 images contributing to 10 final DEM mosaics between 1970 and 1992 at Mount Baker, and 0.65 px (0.13 m) for the 243 images contributing to 18 individual DEMs between 1967 and 1997 at South Cascade Glacier. The relative accuracy of elevation values in the historical time series stacks was 0.68 m at Mount Baker and 0.37 m at South Cascade Glacier. Our products have reduced systematic error and improved accuracy compared to DEM products generated using SfM with manual GCP selection. Final elevation change measurement precision was similar to 0.7-1.0 m over a 30-year period, enabling the study of processes with rates as low as similar to 1-3 cm/yr. Our results demonstrate the potential of this scalable method to rapidly process archives of historical imagery and deliver new quantitative insights on long-term geodetic change and Earth surface processes.

AB Areas of structural damage mechanically weaken Antarctic ice shelves. This potentially preconditions ice shelves for disintegration and enhanced grounding line retreat. The development of damage and its feedback on marine ice sheet dynamics has been identified as key to future ice shelf stability and sea level contributions from Antarctica. However, it is one of the least understood processes that impact ice shelf instability since quantifying damage efficiently and accurately is a challenging task. Challenges relate to the complex surface of Antarctica, variations in viewing-illumination geometry, snow or cloud cover and variable signal-to-noise levels in satellite imagery. Therefore, automated damage assessment approaches require careful pre- and post-processing, lacking the option to be applied to wider spatiotemporal domains. Simultaneously, studies that use manual mapping are usually limited due to the effort required for extensive mapping, which either results in a limited spatial domain or the use of low resolution data.
   This study proposes the NormalisEd Radon transform Damage detection (NeRD) method to detect damage features and their orientations from multi-source satellite imagery. NeRD performs robust, high resolution, large-scale damage assessments. NeRD is applied to the ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea Embayment (ASE) and validated with both manually labelled and existing fracture maps. Validation shows that NeRD detects damage with high recall and provides an accurate physical representation of multi-scale damage features and their orientation. Sensitivity analyses indicate NeRD is robust to different resolution parameter settings. NeRD consistently detects damage for different data sources ranging from optical Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 optical to Synthetic Aperture Radar Sentinel-1 data. Therefore, NeRD paves the way for synergistic multi-source damage detection that overcomes remaining limitations from individual sources. Results show varying damage patterns on the ice shelves in the ASE area in austral summer 2020-2021, with most damage located on the Pine Island, Crosson and Thwaites ice shelves. We show a damage increase on the Pine Island ice shelf between 2013-2019, and display advection and rotation of crevasses. The detected damage orientation can provide insight in the type of crevasse opening mode and the development of damage over time. The damage maps produced with NeRD can help evaluate ice sheet models or machine learning approaches, improving our understanding of damage evolution.

TI Satellite data-driven and knowledge-informed machine learning model for
   estimating global internal solitary wave speed

ID SOUTH CHINA SEA; PROPAGATION; GENERATION; EVOLUTION; IMAGE
AB Internal solitary waves (ISW) are widely distributed worldwide and significantly affect the ocean environment and offshore activities. ISW propagation speed is important for ISW forecasts and varies largely globally. This study collected 810 quasi-synchronous optical satellite images with clear ISW signatures in 13 global hotspots to build a large ISW dataset. ISW speed was calculated using extracted ISW wave crest locations and the time difference between satellite image pairs. The dataset contains 57,196 samples, including extracted ISW wave crests and corresponding ISW phase speed. We developed an ISW propagation speed (IPS) model based on the dataset using machine learning techniques. The model structure includes clustering and regression algorithms. The model adopts two tailored modifications to incorporate the ISW domain knowledge and solve the ISW sample distribution imbalance problems. Implementation domain knowledge (IDK) includes selecting relevant ocean factors and ISW properties based on oceanography theory and remote sensing imaging mechanisms. The second tailored modification is adopting advanced model architecture (AMA) by introducing the Gaussian clustering algorithm to classify ISW samples into several groups beyond the limitation of space and time. The extreme gradient boosting regression algorithm was applied in each group to build the IPS model. We used 47,425 samples as the training dataset and the remaining 9771 samples as the test dataset. The model-predicted ISW speed shows good accuracy, with a root mean square error/relative error rate (RER) of 0.16 (7.9) and 0.30 m/s (12.7%) on the training and test dataset. Analysis shows that IDK and AMA improve the model performance by 19.4% and 13.1%, respectively. With a one-pixel error in the peak-to-peak distance of input parameters, the model results degraded from 0.30 m/s to 0.33 m/s. The IPS model was applied to estimate ISW speeds in ocean regions besides the 13 hotspots, and the average RER is 6.0%. ISW forecast in seven ocean areas was tested, and the results indicate that the IPS model can describe ISW propagation patterns. The model results reveal that the ISW phase speed strongly correlates with the spring and neap tide. The IPS model results show that ISW speed is decreased with a deepening stratification. Model-predicted global ISW propagation speed comparison shows that the Celebes Sea and North-West of South America has the fastest and slowest propagating ISWs all year around, respectively. Discussion on the background current's influence on the IPS model results is presented.

AB In temperate forests, leaf phenology is a sensitive indicator of climate change and a major regulator of seasonal carbon and water cycling. Many studies have documented large intra-site leaf phenology variability across in-dividual trees but conventional approaches for monitoring individual tree-scale leaf phenology are often limited to a small spatial extent and sample size. Recent availability of PlanetScope satellite data with a 3 m spatial resolution, near-daily revisiting frequency, and global coverage provides opportunities to overcome this limi-tation. It also has the advantage of providing spatially explicit information across large spatial coverages compared with ground methods. However, comprehensive assessments of PlanetScope's capacity and scalability for individual tree-scale leaf phenology monitoring remain lacking. To address this knowledge gap, we propose an approach that integrates 0.1 m resolution airborne imagery and ground phenology records of individual trees with PlanetScope image time series, testing it at six NEON forest sites in eastern North America. We first extracted key phenological metrics at the individual tree scale from PlanetScope satellites and then evaluated the metrics with corresponding phenological metrics derived from ground observations over 2018 and 2019. Our results show that PlanetScope-derived fine-scale land surface phenology is able to 1) characterize significant leaf phenology variability at the individual tree scale across all forest sites and years, with r ranging from 0.21 to 0.42 when comparing PlanetScope-derived individual tree-scale phenological metrics with their ground correspon-dences. The accuracy is improved at the species level (r = 0.57-0.82) when more PlanetScope pixels are included; and 2) capture relatively more variations in fall phenology but also with larger uncertainties (e.g., r = 0.82 and RMSE = 2.14; species level) relative to spring phenology (r = 0.76 and RMSE = 0.72). Collectively, this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of PlanetScope's capacity for individual tree/species-scale leaf phenology monitoring and highlights the potential of PlanetScope to provide rich fine-scale phenology infor-mation to significantly advance the field of plant phenology research.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been shown to be a novel proxy for terrestrial gross primary production (GPP). A growing number of ground-based automatic SIF observation systems equipped with hemispherical-conical and bi-hemispherical observation configurations have been developed in synergy with EC flux measurements across different ecosystems. However, the difference in the canopy SIF observed by these two types of configurations has not been well studied, which poses challenges in evaluating their performance in tracking GPP. In this study, we investigated SIF from both hemispherical-conical and bi-hemispherical obser-vation configurations for their ability to track GPP in a maize field during the 2020 growth season. We found that bi-hemispherical SIF observations (SIFHemis) showed higher correlations with GPP at both diurnal and seasonal scales, and the superiority of SIFHemis for GPP estimation was also supported by Soil-Canopy-Observation of Photosynthesis and the Energy balance (SCOPE) model simulations. In addition, we found that the SIFHemis-GPP model established at a satellite overpass time (e.g., 09:30) outperformed the corresponding SIFNadir-GPP model in estimating both the half-hourly and daily GPP. The underlying mechanism for the advantage of this SIFHemis-GPP relationship was elucidated by a simplified geometrical optical model, which showed that the diurnal patterns of the observed sunlit and shaded leaves for the SIFHemis were consistent with those of the canopy GPP. Our study recommends a bi-hemispherical configuration setup for its superiority in monitoring GPP dynamics.

AB In this study, the use of Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence data as a tool for crop monitoring has been explored. For this purpose, time series of images acquired by Sentinel-1 and 2 spanning 2017 have been analysed. The study site is an agricultural area in Sevilla, Spain, where 16 different crop species were cultivated during that year. The time series of 6-day repeat-pass coherence measured at each polarimetric channel (VV and VH), as well as their difference, have been compared to the NDVI and to the backscattering ratio (VH/VV) and other indices based on backscatter. The contribution of different decorrelation sources and the effect of the bias from the space-averaged sample coherence magnitude estimation have been evaluated. Likewise, the usage of 12 days as temporal baseline was tested. The study has been carried for three different orbits, characterised by different incidence angles and acquisition times. All results support using coherence as a measure for monitoring the crop growing season, as it shows good correlations with the NDVI (R-2 > 0.7), and its temporal evolution fits well the main phenological stages of the crops. Although each crop shows its own evolution, the performance of coherence as a vegetation index is high for most of them. VV is generally more correlated with the NDVI than VH. For crop types characterised by low plant density, this difference decreases, with VH even showing higher correlation values in some cases. For a few crop types, such as rice, the backscattering ratio outperforms the coherence in following the growth stages of the plants. Since both coherence and backscattering are directly computed from the radar images, they could be used as complementary sources of information for this purpose. Notably, the measured coherence performs well without the need of compensating the thermal noise decorrelation or the bias due to the finite equivalent number of looks.

AB Sea ice thickness is an important climate indicator and is often monitored in the form of freeboard or total freeboard (with snow cover) using satellite altimetry. However, satellites often have a long revisit interval and freeboard measurements in coastal areas can be challenged by land, deformed ice and limited leads. Using a combination of tide gauge for sea level measurements and a coastal GNSS station for sea ice or snow surface height measurements based on GNSS interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR), I demonstrate free-board measurements with high temporal resolution (hourly). In a 4.5-year period from late 2016 to middle 2021, free-boards measured with this method at Cape Roberts, western Ross Sea in Antarctica exhibit a clear annual cycle of ice growth and ablation in the range of similar to 0-40 cm, and a rapid decrease occurring in Antarctic summer when ocean water temperature increases abruptly. For places where the amplitudes of long-term tides are significantly smaller than the range of annual freeboard variation, GNSS-IR can independently measure both tides and freeboards. Compared to conventional sea ice thickness or freeboard measurements, the tide gauge and GNSS-IR combination method is safe, inexpensive, can distinguish spatial variation of freeboard over a distance of tens to hundreds of meters, and allows continuous monitoring of an area of a few square kilometers.

AB Ecological resilience is the capacity of a system to maintain function following disturbance. With the frequency and severity of wildfire activity increasing due to warmer and drier global climate conditions, there are increasing reports of declines in ecological resilience and ecosystems at risk of collapse due to post-fire recovery failure. Observational monitoring of post-fire recovery at the landscape scale is important to understand drivers, identify vulnerable ecosystems and prioritize management intervention to support resilience. Defining a suitably representative baseline condition to compare post-fire recovery states against can be challenging, particularly in broad-scale remote sensing approaches. Here, we introduce a new approach to monitoring post-fire recovery by satellite imagery, the post-fire stability index. The method is based on the concept that a disturbed system state will be reflected by increasing or decreasing rates of system change, while undisturbed or recovered system states are characterised by near-zero rates of change. This reflects the typical pattern of diminishing rate of change in post-fire recovery trajectories. We demonstrate strong performance and suitability of the post-fire stability index in comparison to alternative approaches through time series analyses, and independent validation from post-fire vegetation surveys taken at one-year post-fire. The post-fire stability index was consistently the best performing model across all field measures of vegetative response following the fire event. In ecosystems which exhibit post -fire resprouting, higher values in the post-fire stability index were associated with higher levels of field-based measures of foliage projective cover and canopy cover (+/-resprouting), and with lower levels of basal and no resprouting. The post-fire stability index provides a relatively simple and practical solution for consistent broad-scale monitoring post-fire recovery with satellite imagery, which together with standardised fire severity mapping, provide extensive opportunities for further fire and landscape ecology research.

AB Accurate crop phenology information is essential for precision farming and agricultural productivity improve-ment. In recent years, in-situ equipment on crop phenology observation has been boosted, which generates high-quality real-time pictures on capturing vegetation phenological changes. However, due to the limited number of ground sites, it is impossible to measure large-scale crop phenology with local observations. Complementary, the freely available Sentinel satellites with high revisit frequency provide an opportunity to map accurate crop phenology at an unprecedented fine spatial scale. Because of the differences in viewing angle and range, the consistency of crop phenological stages varies between satellite and ground observations. To fill the gap between satellite and ground observations, we developed a spatial-aware scheme to integrate SAR and optical time-series data for accurate crop phenology tracking. To be specific, we propose a new deep learning model called Deep-CroP framework to improve the alignment between satellite and ground observations on crop phenology. The experiment results on selected ground sites demonstrate that the proposed Deep-CroP is able to accurately identify crops phenology and narrow the discrepancies from 30+ days to as high as several days. In addition, we applied the Deep-CroP to large-scale Sentinel time-series to map spatial patterns of phenology at fine resolution imagery on two study areas (i.e., TA1 and TA2). In general, the potential of satellites time-series for ground-level crop phenology observation is verified. Also, the consistency between satellite and PhenoCam observations is expected to be further improved.

AB The development of near-real time forest monitoring systems, which are used to create alerts for events such as logging or fire, often involves tradeoffs between accuracy and timeliness. In the context of forest monitoring, timeliness is measured by the lag between when a change occurs in the forest and the creation of an alert about the event. Conventional accuracy assessments quantify both false negative and false positive errors in change maps, but do not specify those rates as a function of lag. Recent near real-time (NRT) accuracy assessment methods summarize the relationship between lag and correctly identified change events, but do not integrate consideration of changes mapped where they have not occurred. Here, we propose an assessment framework that we call "Sigmoid Accuracy", which characterizes forest change detection accuracy as it relates to timeliness. Using a change monitoring algorithm that applies the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm (CCDC) to Sentinel-1 radar data in Madagascar, we demonstrate how the assessment framework can be used to calculate a lag-dependent F1-Score to create a sigmoidal curve describing system performance as it relates to the time since a change event. We introduce two new performance metrics that define key moments along this curve: "Initial Delay", or the minimum time required to create an alert as observed in reference data, and the "Level Off Point", or the lag at which accuracy stabilizes. Our framework accommodates varying assessment designs, as demonstrated using pixel-, block-, and event-based agreement for the response design. These metrics provide a holistic way to evaluate and compare the usefulness of forest monitoring systems in real-world applications.

AB Over the past decade, several global maps of above-ground biomass (AGB) have been produced, but they exhibit significant differences that reduce their value for climate and carbon cycle modelling, and also for national estimates of forest carbon stocks and their changes. The number of such maps is anticipated to increase because of new satellite missions dedicated to measuring AGB. Objective and consistent methods to estimate the accuracy and uncertainty of AGB maps are therefore urgently needed. This paper develops and demonstrates a framework aimed at achieving this. The framework provides a means to compare AGB maps with AGB estimates from a global collection of National Forest Inventories and research plots that accounts for the uncertainty of plot AGB errors. This uncertainty depends strongly on plot size, and is dominated by the combined errors from tree measurements and allometric models (inter-quartile range of their standard deviation (SD) = 30-151 Mg ha(-1)). Estimates of sampling errors are also important, especially in the most common case where plots are smaller than map pixels (SD = 16-44 Mg ha(-1)). Plot uncertainty estimates are used to calculate the minimum-variance linear unbiased estimates of the mean forest AGB when averaged to 0.1 degrees. These are used to assess four AGB maps: Baccini (2000), GEOCARBON (2008), GlobBiomass (2010) and CCI Biomass (2017). Map bias, estimated using the differences between the plot and 0.1 degrees map averages, is modelled using random forest regression driven by variables shown to affect the map estimates. The bias model is particularly sensitive to the map estimate of AGB and tree cover, and exhibits strong regional biases. Variograms indicate that AGB map errors have map-specific spatial correlation up to a range of 50-104 km, which increases the variance of spatially aggregated AGB map estimates compared to when pixel errors are independent. After bias adjustment, total pantropical AGB and its associated SD are derived for the four map epochs. This total becomes closer to the value estimated by the Forest Resources Assessment after every epoch and shows a similar decrease. The framework is applicable to both local and global-scale analysis, and is available at https://github.com/arnanaraza/PlotToMap. Our study therefore constitutes a major step towards improved AGB map validation and improvement.

AB A novel method is introduced to objectively and automatically identify persistent thermal fronts across the ocean from 60 degrees N to 60 degrees S: FROnt Delineation in the Ocean (FRODO), an algorithm developed to delineate sea surface temperature (SST) fronts, was applied to global satellite observations. By relying on long-term averaged frontal probability fields of SST, persistent SST fronts were located globally in an automated manner. The algorithm was applied to AVHRR Pathfinder and MODIS observations, spanning the period from 1982 through 2011, and resulted in new insights regarding frontal zones: new fronts were detected, the location of some fronts identified in the existing literature has been updated, the accuracy of the algorithm was tested through comparison with visible color and SST data, and the variability in frontal location over climatological seasons was explored. While significant spatial variability prevents the algorithm from accurately tracking some fronts, the results were found to agree very well with observations in the case of fronts associated with ocean bathymetry. The output of the algorithm consists of five digital global sets of persistent fronts: one based on the 30 year time series and four based on the climatological seasons derived from the same time series, which will facilitate the study of the links between SST fronts and other oceanic processes.

AB Surface longwave radiation (SLR) plays an important role in the energy budget of the Earth's climate system. Remote sensing provides various data sources to retrieve SLR on a large scale and with high spatial resolution (e. g., 1 km). Multiple retrieval methods of surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR) based on satellite thermal infrared data produce different retrieval results for the same scenario. Therefore, validating these models is necessary to understand their characteristics and limitations. To this end, ground-based measurements were used to provide independent validation of six widely used SDLR models for clear sky conditions over 41 Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations worldwide. The Wang2020 model had the best overall performance (bias of similar to 5.480 W/m(2), root-mean-square errors [RMSE] of 23.226 W/m(2), R-2 of 0.879), and Tang2008 model had similar retrieval capability. The errors of LST had limited influence on the retrieval accuracy of SDLR models. When using the near-surface air temperature, the retrieval accuracy of the Zhou2007 model was significantly improved with a range of similar to 9.5 W/m(2) for the RMSE. The uncertainty of TCWV had significant effect on all model performances, wherein the Zhou2007 model had stronger error resilience of TCWV. Moreover, MODIS TIR TCWV data provided better performance than NIR TCWV in most situations, and thereby are preferred to use in the SDLR retrieval. Surface altitude had a lesser impact on SDLR retrieval than terrain effects. All models overestimated SDLR for peak stations in mountainous areas, with biases reaching 56.614 W/m(2) and RMSE reaching 63.909 W/m(2). Land cover type also had a significant effect on retrieval accuracy; model performances were poorer in the desert and barren where atmospheric conditions are extremely dry and hot. Remote sensing SDLR data with high accuracy are needed for hydrological, agricultural, and climate change applications. The results of this study provide a reference for the SDLR retrieval accuracy based on clear-sky models.

AB A novel model for estimating sensible heat flux in urban areas using satellite data is presented here. Sensible heat flux (Q(H)) is a primary component of the urban surface energy budget and is critical to regulating air temperature in cities. The model employs data from the NASA & NOAA GOES-16 geostationary satellite, ground-based observations from NOAA Automated Surface Observation Stations (ASOS), and land cover data from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) as inputs for an iterative algorithm that is based on surface-layer similarity theory for turbulence parameterization. The application of this model specifically to urban areas is enabled by the spatial extent of the GOES-16 satellite and an element roughness height estimation method based on NLCD land cover data. Model results were independently validated using three flux towers located in different areas of New York City. Statistics generated over a year-long validation period from June 2019 to May 2020 show a root mean-square error (RMSE) of 47.32 W-m(-2), a mean bias error (MBE) of 16.58 W-m(-2), and an R-2 correlation value of 0.70. Model results were also compared to results from the urbanized Weather Research and Forecasting (uWRF) model relative to flux tower observational data to allow for a comparison between numerical models. The dedicated Q(H) model outperformed the uWRF model relative to observational data, with an RMSE reduction of 63.5 W-m(-2), an MBE reduction of 17.5 W-m(-2), and an R-2 increase of 0.08. Validation results show good agreement between model and observed values and performance comparison results show an improvement over a current numerical method for estimation of Q(H), suggesting the use of satellite data as a cost-effective and accessible option for estimating Q(H) in urban areas.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) shows great potential to assess plants physiological state and response to environmental changes. Recently the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) provides a promising way to quantify the confounding effect of canopy structure in SIF, while the difference between SIF and NIRv under varying environmental conditions has not been well explored. Here we developed a simple approach to extract the fluorescence yield (Phi(F)) by the combined use of SIF and the near-infrared radiance of vegetation (NIRvR). The proposed NIRvR approach was evaluated in multiple ways, including with the seasonal leaf-level steady-state fluorescence yield. Results indicate that NIRvR-derived Phi(F) well captured the seasonal variation of the fluorescence yield changes, and achieved similar results with the existing approach. Both SIF and NIRvR were derived from the airborne imaging fluorescence spectrometer HyPlant for three case studies to evaluate the impacts of light adaptation, heat stress and water limitation on Phi(F). For the light adaptation case study, Phi(F) over the low-light adapted sugar beet field was about 1.3 times larger compared to an unaffected reference area while the difference in NIRvR was minimal, which clearly shows the short-term photosynthetic light induction effect and the ability of SIF to detect plant physiological responses. For the heat stress experiment, OF decreased during a natural heatwave in 2015 in the fields of rapeseed from 0.0150 to 0.0130, barley from 0.0152 to 0.0144, and wheat from 0.0146 to 0.0142 which showed signs of senescence, while slightly increased from 0.0125 to 0.0130 in the corn field which was still in growing. At the water-limited sugar beet field, Phi(F) first increased towards solar noon and then slightly decreased during the afternoon over the water-limited areas from 0.017 to 0.021 and 0.020, with high temperature and high light at noon. The advantages to use SIF/NIRvR as a proxy of Phi(F) to detect stress-induced limitations in photosynthesis include that the impacts of canopy structure and sun-sensor geometry on the Phi(F) estimation are explicitly cancelled, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is not required as input. Finally, our approach is directly applicable to satellite-derived estimates of SIF, enabling the study of variations in Phi(F) to detect the effects of abiotic changes and stresses at large scale.

AB Obtaining low vegetation data is important in order to quantify the structural characteristics of a forest. Dense three-dimensional (3D) laser scanning data can provide information on the vertical profile of a forest. However, most studies have focused on the dominant and subdominant layers of the forest, while few studies have tried to delineate the low vegetation. To address this issue, we propose a framework for individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation from laser data that focuses on both overstory and understory trees. The framework includes 1) a new algorithm (SSD) for 3D ITC segmentation of dominant trees, by detecting the symmetrical structure of the trees, and 2) removing points of dominant trees and mean shift clustering of the low vegetation. The framework was tested on a boreal forest in Sweden and the performance was compared 1) between plots with different stem density levels, vertical complexities, and tree species composition, and 2) using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, and merged ALS and TLS data (ALS + TLS data). The proposed framework achieved detection rates of 0.87 (ALS + TLS), 0.86 (TLS), and 0.76 (ALS) when validated with field inventory data (of trees with a diameter at breast height >= 4 cm). When validating the estimated number of understory trees by visual interpretation, the framework achieved 19%, 21%, and 39% root-mean-square error values with ALS + TLS, TLS, and ALS data, respectively. These results show that the SSD algorithm can successfully separate laser points of overstory and understory trees, ensuring the detection and segmentation of low vegetation in forest. The proposed framework can be used with both ALS and TLS data, and achieve ITC segmentation for forests with various structural attributes. The results also illustrate the potential of using ALS data to delineate low vegetation.

ID FUSION
AB GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) is a novel remote sensing technique for the monitoring of geophysical parameters using reflected GNSS signals from the Earth's surface. Ocean wind speed monitoring is the main objective of the recently launched Cyclone GNSS (CyGNSS), a GNSS-R constellation of eight microsatellites, launched in late 2016. In this study, the capability of deep learning, especially, for an operational wind speed data derivation from the measured Delay-Doppler Maps (DDMs) is characterized. CyGNSSnet is based on convolutional layers for the feature extraction from bistatic radar cross section (BRCS) DDMs, along with fully connected layers for processing ancillary technical and higher-level input parameters. The best architecture is determined on a validation set and is evaluated over a completely blind dataset from a different time span than that of the training data to validate the generality of the model for operational usage. After a data quality control, CyGNSSnet results in an RMSE of 1.36 m/s leading to a significant improvement by 28% in comparison to the officially operational retrieval algorithm. The RMSE is the lowest among those seen in the literature for any conventional or machine learning-based algorithm. The benefits of the convolutional layers, the advantages and weaknesses of the model are discussed. CyGNSSnet offers efficient processing of GNSS-R measurements for high-quality global ocean winds.

AB The presence of surface water on the canopy affects radar backscatter. However, its influence on the relationship between radar backscatter and crop biophysical parameters has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the influence of surface canopy water (SCW) on the relationship between L-band radar backscatter and biophysical variables of interest in agricultural monitoring. In this study, we investigated the effect of SCW on the relationship between co- and cross-polarized radar backscatter, cross ratios (VH/VV and HV/HH), and radar vegetation index (RVI) and dry biomass, vegetation water content (VWC), plant height and leaf area index (LAI). In addition, the effect of SCW on estimated vegetation optical depth (VOD) and its relationship with internal VWC was investigated. The analysis was based on data collected during a field experiment in Florida, USA in 2018. A corn field was scanned with a truck-mounted, fully polarimetric, L-band radar along with continuous monitoring of SCW (dew, interception) and soil moisture every 15 min for 58 days. In addition, pre-dawn destructive sampling was conducted to measure internal vegetation water content and dry biomass. Results showed that the presence of SCW can increase the radar backscatter up to 2 dB and this effect was lower for cross ratios (CRs) and RVI. The Spearman's rank correlations between radar observables and biophysical parameters were, on average, 0.2 higher for dry vegetation compared to wet vegetation. The estimated VOD from wet vegetation was generally higher than those from dry vegetation, which led to different fitting parameter (socalled b) values in the linear fit between VOD and VWC. The results presented here underscore the importance of considering the influence of SCW on the retrieval of biophysical variables of interest in agricultural monitoring. In particular, they highlight the importance of overpass time, and the impact that daily patterns in dew and interception can have on the retrieval of biophysical variables of interest.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observed by satellites has advanced the monitoring of terrestrial photosynthesis regionally and globally. The relationship between SIF and gross primary production (GPP) at leaf, canopy, and ecosystem scales has received tremendous attention in recent years. It remains controversial whether the SIF-GPP relationship at the ecosystem scale is universal or dependent upon vegetation type. New SIF observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) with unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution provide a new opportunity to elucidate the SIF-GPP relationship. Here, we examine the SIF-GPP relationship for seven major vegetation types across the U.S. with TROPOMI SIF and in-situ GPP data for 83 eddy covariance flux sites. We find that TROPOMI SIF shows a strong and consistent relationship with tower based GPP at both satellite footprint and grid-cell levels. The slope of the SIF-GPP relationship is similar among all the vegetation types except croplands, demonstrating a nearly universal (converging to similar to 13.5 g C m(-2) d(-1)/W m(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1)) rather than vegetation type-specific SIF-GPP relationship. This confirms that TROPOMI SIF can be used as a proxy for GPP across a wide variety of vegetation types, and can also be used to quantify GPP by avoiding uncertainty associated with land cover maps. The C-4 crops have a much higher slope than the C-3 crops, and therefore croplands tend to have a higher slope than C-3-dominated vegetation types (e.g., forests, shrublands, savannas). We also find that the TROPOMI SIF is well correlated with GPP under normal or wetter conditions, while their relationship becomes weaker under water stress. Our TROPOMI-based study could improve our understanding of the SIF-GPP relationship at the ecosystem scale and advance the mapping of GPP globally with SIF observations from space.

AB Recently, a large number of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has been introduced into landslide in-vestigations with the growing launch of new SAR satellites, such as ALOS/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1. Therefore, it is appropriate to develop new approaches to retrieve three-dimensional (3D) displacements and long-term (> 10 years) displacement time series to investigate the spatio-temporal evolution and creep behavior of landslides. In this study, a new approach for the estimation of 3D and long-term displacement time series of landslides, based on the fusion of C-and L-band SAR observations, is presented. This method is applied to map 3D and long-term dis-placements (nearly 12 years) of the landslides in Gongjue County, Tibet in China; four sets of SAR images from different platforms (i.e., L-band ascending ALOS/PALSAR-1, C-band descending ENVISAT, and C-band ascending and descending Sentinel-1 SAR datasets) covering the period of January 2007 to November 2018 were collected and exploited. First, the assumption that the landslide moves parallel to its ground surface is used to produce 3D displacement rates and time series by fusing ascending and descending Sentinel-1 SAR images, from which the optimal sliding direction for each pixel of the slope is well estimated. Then, the long-term displacement time-series of the landslide between January 2007 and October 2018 in the estimated sliding direction is recovered by fusing L-band ALOS/PALSAR-1 and C-band Sentinel-1 SAR images. In order to fill the time gap of nearly four years between ALOS/PALSAR-1 and Sentinel-1 SAR images, the Tikhonov regularization (TR) method is developed to establish the observational equation. Moreover, to solve the problem arising from ALOS/PALSAR-1 and Sentinel-1 images with different wavelengths, incidence angles and flight directions, the measurements from ALOS/PALSAR-1 and Sentinel-1 images are both projected to the estimated optimal sliding direction to achieve a unified displacement datum. Our results from ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images suggest that the maximum displacement rates of the study area in the vertical and east-west directions from December 2016 to October 2018 were greater than 70 and 80 mm/year, respectively, and 2D displacement results reveal that the displacement patterns and movement characteristics of all the detected landslides are not identical in the study area. Specifically, the 3D displacement results successfully revealed the spatiotemporal displacement patterns and movement direction of each block of the Shadong landslide, and long-term displacement time series showed for the first time that the maximum cumulative displacement exceeds 1.3 m from January 2007 to October 2018. Moreover, the kinematic evolution and possible driving factors of landslides were investigated using 2D and 3D and long-term displacement results, coupled with hydrological factors and unidimensional constitutive models of the rocks.

AB An algorithm for retrieving nighttime aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day-Night Band (DNB) observations of reflected moonlight is presented for rural areas during the western U.S. fire seasons. The algorithm uses the UNified and Linearized Vector Radiative Transfer Model (UNL-VRTM) with newly developed capabilities for considering lunar illuminations. Cloud and fire pixels are screened out by utilizing the radiance from the VIIRS Moderate-resolution Bands (M-Band) and the DNB. Rural and city pixels are classified based on a pre-calculated city light database. The surface spectral reflectance for DNB ranging from 342 to 1107 nm is estimated by a random forest approach, which is trained using the surface spectral reflectance from the existing spectral libraries. For the fire seasons of 2017 and 2020, the nighttime AOD retrieval is shown to play an indispensable role in describing the nonlinear diurnal movement of smoke transport and discerning the source of smoke plumes heretofore observable only in the daytime. The retrieved AOD values show good agreement with spatiotemporally collocated Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) AOD values, with linear correlation coefficient values of -0.96/0.95 and -86%/69% of the AOD pairs falling in an uncertainty envelope of +/-(0.085 + 0.10AOD), which is superior to AOD reanalysis from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). These results affirm the significant potential of nighttime AOD to improve the analysis and forecast of regional to global biomass-burning aerosol distributions, filling a critical gap in the diurnal description of a key element of Earth's climate system.

AB Rapid and accurate crop type mapping is of great significance for agricultural management and sustainable development. Time-series multi-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is suitable for obtaining the large-scale distribution of crop types and continuously monitoring crops. At present, the classification method based on the time-series alignment of time-varying feature curves has been widely used, which can take the uncertainty of the phenological cycles of crops into account. The most classical method is the nearest neighbor (NN) classifier based on the dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment. While the DTW alignment does not consider the local shape of the curves and temporal ranges, and the NN classifier is inadequate in generalization, which restricts the accuracy of crop type mapping. In this paper, a pairwise proximity function support vector machine (ppfSVM) classification method with the time-weighted shapeDTW (TWshapeDTW) alignment is proposed. Firstly, the novel alignment method simultaneously considers the local shape of the curve and the temporal range of crops. Besides, the novel ppfSVM classifier with the time-series alignment kernel is established. Such kernel matrix considers dual-similarity metrics of multiple features, and it is positive semi-definite (PSD) in this classifier. With 42 Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR images located in Gansu Province, China, the crop classification maps in 2018 and 2019 are generated respectively. The proposed method in this paper obtains the overall accuracies of more than 90% in both two years, and the changes of crop types from 2018 to 2019 are also in line with the actual crop rotation. Compared with traditional classification methods (SVM and the NN method with the DTW alignment), it is found that the proposed method has higher overall accuracy (OA) and better robustness in the case of small number of samples. The OA's improvements of our method compared with the SVM method are 3% and 1% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Such improvements are 14% and 12% respect to the NN method with the DTW alignment. This method can achieve more obvious improvement under the condition of less training samples and unaligned phenological sequences. Furthermore, the novel TWshapeDTW alignment is superior to the DTW and the time-weighted DTW alignment under the ppfSVM classifier. The OA's improvement introduced by the TWshapeDTW alignment respect to the DTW alignment can obtain 5% and 4% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.

AB Lake ice is an important feature of the physical landscape at northern latitudes. Not only does the presence of lake ice help modulate weather and climate but it also plays an important role in travel between northern communities. Furthermore, the thickness of ice cover can impact overwintering fish habitat and access to fresh water during winter months. Lake ice cover and lake ice thickness are two notable climate proxies identified by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). Changes in ice thickness can impact lakes freezing to bed which in turn affect permafrost thaw while longer periods of open water can impact heat transfer to the atmosphere. With recent climate warming in the Northern Hemisphere, there are general trends towards thinner ice and an increase in the length of the open water season. However, the paucity of in-situ observations in many countries has led to remote sensing playing an ever-increasing role for lake ice monitoring. This paper reviews progress in lake ice research conducted using active microwave remote sensing over the last 50 years and highlights areas where future developments are needed. Analysis of the literature found that the diversity of study areas where this work is taking place has increased, incorporating more lake sites from the midlatitudes in North America, Europe, and Asia. Additionally, clear connections can be made between the launch of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites and patterns in the use of certain radar frequencies in scientific studies. This review also discusses evolving theories concerning the scattering mechanisms associated with lake ice as well as the current state of lake ice cover and ice thickness retrieval methods. The paper concludes with a suite of recommendations for future research, highlighting work that is needed on: 1) advancing our understanding of the response of active microwave signals to lake ice properties; 2) applying machine learning algorithms to lake ice classification; 3) further exploring the retrieval of ice thickness from imaging SAR and radar altimetry data; and 4) other considerations such as data availability and the topic of snow on lake ice.

AB Crop type mapping at the field level is critical for a variety of applications in agricultural monitoring, and satellite imagery is becoming an increasingly abundant and useful raw input from which to create crop type maps. Still, in many regions crop type mapping with satellite data remains constrained by a scarcity of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models. When training data is not available in one region, classifiers trained in similar regions can be transferred, but shifts in the distribution of crop types as well as transformations of the features between regions lead to reduced classification accuracy. We present a methodology that uses aggregate-level crop statistics to correct the classifier by accounting for these two types of shifts. To adjust for shifts in the crop type composition we present a scheme for properly reweighting the posterior probabilities of each class that are output by the classifier. To adjust for shifts in features we propose a method to estimate and remove linear shifts in the mean feature vector. We demonstrate that this methodology leads to substantial improvements in overall classification accuracy when using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to map crop types in Occitanie, France and in Western Province, Kenya. When using LDA as our base classifier, we found that in France our methodology led to percent reductions in misclassifications ranging from 2.8% to 42.2% (mean = 21.9%) over eleven different training departments, and in Kenya the percent reductions in misclassification were 6.6%, 28.4%, and 42.7% for three training regions. While our methodology was statistically motivated by the LDA classifier, it can be applied to any type of classifier. As an example, we demonstrate its successful application to improve a Random Forest classifier.

AB With the launch of the Observing Carbon Observatories (OCO-2 and OCO-3), we have entered a new era of greenhouse gas (GHG) data collection where sub-city scale data can be collected at varying times across the entire globe. An increasing focus on quantifying urban emissions of GHGs from policy makers has begun to spur new research into how best to use this unique and very high resolution data set. While, historically, this line of research has been the domain of limited domain mesoscale and regional models, an increasing understanding and respect for boundary inflow uncertainty and bias has led people to search for an alternative modeling framework that both characterizes high frequency variability of CO2 in space and time as well as honor mass conservation requirements globally and be seamless with respect to boundaries. To monitor local anthropogenic emissions from space, the influence of atmospheric signals originating from outside the local area of interest needs to be quantified. In our first step towards building a comprehensive multi-scale CO2 inversion system, we use free running simulations of the Ocean Land Atmosphere Model (OLAM), a variable-resolution general circulation model, to explore the signal-to-noise statistics of anthropogenic urban emissions of CO2 versus the background inflow for approximately 40 of the largest cities across the globe. We show that signal-to-noise levels are much better in winter time than summer but also that the winter biological inflow is far from negligible, suggesting that the commonly held assumption that biology can be ignored in winter time urban emission estimates is probably incorrect. Simulated pressure-weighted column average CO2 (XCO2) is also used to evaluate the ability of fixed location XCO2 measurements to provide background inflow estimates. Results show why Los Angeles, a heavily instrumented and studied urban center, is likely one of the easiest cities to observe globally from space, despite its relatively complex meteorology. Lastly, we discuss challenges and possible research paths forward to continue to advance the notion of multi-scale global CO2 flux inversion systems capable of simultaneously optimizing local urban emissions and large-scale CO2 transport patterns.

AB Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data enable accurate modeling and mapping of aboveground biomass (AGB), but the limited spatial and temporal extents of ALS data collection limit the capacity for broad-scale carbon accounting. Conversely, while space-based remote sensing instruments provide increased spatial and temporal coverage, it can be difficult to directly link field-level vegetation biometrics to satellite data due to coarser spatial resolution and positional uncertainty. The combined use of ALS and satellite remote sensing data may offer a solution to efficient, accurate, and consistent AGB mapping across time and space. Such airborne-spaceborne data fusion has been demonstrated successfully in high-biomass settings; however, the unique structural conditions of dryland woodland ecosystems, with open canopies and low leaf area indices, pose mapping challenges that require further study. These challenges are particularly acute with large footprint spaceborne lidar, where short, widely-spaced trees may limit the capacity for accurate AGB estimation. In this study, we present a scaled methodological framework for linking field-measured woodland AGB to ALS data and, in turn, linking ALSmodeled AGB to satellite data, using pin similar to on-juniper woodlands in southeastern Utah as a case study. We compare the effectiveness of this scaling approach using two satellite sensors, Landsat 8 OLI (multispectral) and GEDI (lidar). Since the predicted outputs of our local-scale model are being used as inputs to our regional-scale model, we also demonstrate an approach for propagating uncertainty throughout this nested, multiscale analytical framework, leveraging the inherent variability within a random forest's decision trees. Given the positional uncertainty of GEDI footprints, we test a range of different footprint sizes for their relative effects on ALS-GEDI AGB model accuracy. Our local-scale (field-ALS) predictive model was able to account for 74% of variance in AGB, and estimate AGB with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 14 Mg/ha, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 11.09 Mg/ha. Our regional-scale (ALS-Landsat/GEDI) analysis with propagated uncertainty revealed that the combined use of Landsat and GEDI metrics produced the best predictive model (R2 = 0.68; RMSE = 12.71 Mg/ha; MAE = 9.40 Mg/ha), followed by Landsat-only metrics (R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 13.08 Mg/ha; MAE = 9.71 Mg/ha), and GEDI-only metrics (R2 = 0.49, RMSE = 16.01 Mg/ha; MAE = 12.14 Mg/ha). These results suggest that Landsat may be better-suited than GEDI for estimating AGB in woodland environments where low canopy covers and short trees limit the capacity for precisely characterizing vegetation structure within largefootprint, waveform lidar data. The footprint size analysis revealed that larger simulated footprints (e.g., 30 m radius and greater) produced higher GEDI model accuracies; however, increasing footprint radii beyond 30 m does not significantly increase model accuracy. This research represents an important step forward in improving our capacity for reliably mapping woodland AGB, and provides an early test case for the application of GEDI data to woodland AGB mapping.

AB An all-weather land surface temperature (LST) dataset at moderate to high spatial resolutions (e.g. 1 km) has been in urgent need, especially in areas frequently covered in clouds (i.e. the Tibetan Plateau). Merging satellite thermal infrared (TIR) and passive microwave (PMW) observations is a widely-adopted approach to derive such LST datasets, whereas the swath gap of the PMW data leads to considerable data deficiency or low reliability in the merged LST, especially at the low-mid latitudes. Fortunately, reanalyzed data provides the spatiotemporally continuous LST and thus, is promising to be merged with TIR data for reconstructing the all-weather LST without this issue. However, few studies along this direction have been reported. In this context, based on the decomposition model of LST time series, this study proposes a novel reanalysis and thermal infrared remote sensing data merging (RTM) method to reconstruct the 1-km all-weather LST. The method was applied to merge Aqua/ Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Global/China Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS/CLDAS) data over the Tibetan Plateau and the surrounding area. Results show that the RTM LST has RMSEs of 2.03-3.98 K and coefficients of determination of 0.82-0.93 under all-weather conditions when validated against the ground measured LST. Besides, from comparison between RTM LST and current existing PMW-TIR merged LST, it is found the former LST efficiently outperforms the latter one in terms of accuracy and image quality, especially over the MW swath gap-covered area. In addition, compared to the MODIS-CLDAS merged all-weather LST based on the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), the two LSTs have comparable accuracy while the RTM LST has higher spatial completeness. The method is promising for generating a long-term all-weather LST record at moderate to high spatiotemporal resolutions at large scales, which would be beneficial to associated studies and applications.

AB The adjacency effect can blur and reduce the contrast of satellite images. For low visibility, the adjacency effect has a crucial impact on submeter-scale spatial resolution optical (SM) satellite images. Therefore, SM satellite images are preprocessed with an atmospheric correction before performing visual interpretation and quantitative research. This atmospheric correction includes the adjacency effect (expressed by the average background reflectance, ABR) correction and atmospheric intrinsic reflectance correction. ABR is related to the spatial distance from the central pixel to its surrounding pixels (SDCS) and is affected by the reflectance difference between the central pixel and its surrounding pixels (RDCS). Existing methods to calculate ABR do not include the effect of RDCS. Therefore, in this study, we use equivalent average background reflectance (EABR) instead of ABR used in the 6S model. EABR considers the effects of the strengths of the aerosol optical depth (AOD), SDCS, and RDCS on the adjacency effect. Compared with ABR, EABR can better represent the adjacency effect in an SM satellite image. We develop an adaptive atmospheric correction algorithm (called adaptive-AC) based on EABR. The adaptive characteristic of adaptive-AC is that it can adjust the contribution factor (or weighted value) of the background pixel to the adjacency effect according to the SDCS and RDCS. The application of adaptive-AC to a panchromatic band image of WorldView-3 (WV-3) reveals that adaptive-AC can significantly improve image quality, with the reflectance of pixels in the corrected image processed by adaptive-AC being close to the actual reflectance. Comparison with the results of the atmospheric correction algorithm in the 6S model (6S-AC) indicates that adaptive-AC is more suitable for SM satellite image preprocessing than 6S-AC approaches. There is no clear theory or formula available to calculate the exact value of the adjacency effect range (Rad). Therefore, different Rad values are used in applying the adaptive-AC and 6S-AC. The results show that the larger is the Rad used to construct the adjacency effect model, the more satisfactory is the atmospheric correction.

AB With the advent of the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission and the associated Ground Validation campaigns, there has been a strong development of studies related to dual-frequency and more recently to triple-frequency radar. In this context, one requirement is that at least one of the radar frequencies operates in the Rayleigh regime while the others have to ensure a measurable difference in reflectivities. A common radar coupling for triple frequency systems is the Ku-, Ka-, and W-band.
   Multi-frequency radars, in addition to the classic single-frequency reflectivity (SFR) measurement for each frequency, allow a further parameter, the dual-frequency ratio (DFR) defined as the ratio between two reflectivities at two frequencies. Referring to the same measurement volume, and for a fixed microphysical ice particle model, SFR and DFR allow to better constraint parameters of the particle size distribution, such as the mass-weighted mean diameter (D-m) and the normalized intercept parameter (N-w) when a normalized gamma distribution is assumed.
   This paper deals with various topics with the preliminary purpose of assessing the accuracy of the ice water content (IWC) estimate obtained using SFR and DFR methods to evaluate the improvements brought by the use of DFR. To pursue this goal, a simple microphysical model was used to choose the form of the SFR and DFR estimation algorithms and to evaluate their performances in a simulated framework.
   The most important aspect revealed by the study is that the cloud water content (CWC) plays a very important role both in the mass vs. diameter relationship as well as in the IWC estimation. The combined use of specific radar algorithms according to the different CWC values has shown notable improvements for the IWC estimation. Since CWC is not an operational measure, a substitute parameter was sought in the (DFRaou, DFRwoa) domain defined by the Ka- and Ku-band and by the W- and Ka-band measurements. This new parameter provides improvements similar to those obtained with the use of CWC.
   Data from the OLYMPEX field campaign that include an airborne triple-frequency radar at Ku-, Ka-, and W-band, as well as airborne measurements of in-situ bulk microphysics and meteorological parameters were used to validate the robustness of the methodology.

AB Passive microwave remote sensing observations at L-band provide key and global information on surface soil moisture and vegetation water content, which are related to the Earth water and carbon cycles. Only two space-borne L-band sensors are currently operating: SMOS, launched end of 2009 and thus providing now a 10-year global data set and SMAP, launched beginning of 2015. This study provides a state-of-the-art scientific overview of the SMOS-IC retrieval data set based on the SMOS L-band observations. This SMOS product aims at improved performance and independence of auxiliary data, key features for robust applications. The SMOS-IC product includes both a soil moisture (SM) and a L-band vegetation optical depth (L-VOD) data set which are currently at the basis of several studies evaluating the impact of climate and anthropogenic activities on aboveground carbon stocks. Since the release of the first version, the algorithm has been significantly changed in support to key applications, but no document is available to report these changes. This paper fills this gap by analyzing key science questions related to the product development, reviewing application results and presenting an extensive description of the last version of the product (version 2) considering changes in comparison to the previous version (V105). For the future it is planned to merge the SMOS and SMAP L-VOD data sets to ensure L-VOD data continuity in the event of failure of one of the space-borne SMOS or SMAP sensors.

AB Groundwater overexploitation has caused dramatic land subsidence over the metropolitan areas in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and many other economic centers worldwide. Suzhou (China) is such a sinking city and faces enhanced flood risks. Restrictions on groundwater exploitation (RGE) have been imposed by the government since 1997 to prevent further elevation loss. However, knowledge on the spatiotemporal evolution of the urban land deformation during the RGE is limited by sparse and infrequent field measurements, which may bias the evaluation of the RGE policy and the strategy formulation of water management. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) provides regional surface deformation at a regular temporal interval of dozens of days. Here we present the decadal evolution of ground deformation in Suzhou using multiple InSAR datasets from ERS1/2, ENVISAT-ASAR, and ALOS-1 PALSAR-1 during 1993?2010, spanning the entire RGE period. An elongated zone from southern to northwestern Suzhou is highlighted by a drastic cumulative land subsidence exceeding 0.9 m due to inelastic aquifer compaction. We characterize the spatiotemporal ground deformation response to the RGE policy using an exponential decay function, from which we also infer the subsurface boundaries with sharp bedrock gradients. We identify a corridor connecting the Yangcheng and Taihu lakes, which is highly sensitive to RGE during the decelerated subsidence. Our analysis also suggests that urban subsidence in Suzhou was under control by 2006(-0.4)(+1.4).

AB Following more than two decades of research and developments made possible through various proof-of-concept hyperspectral remote sensing missions, it has been anticipated that hyperspectral imaging would enhance the accuracy of remotely sensed in-water products. This study investigates such expected improvements and demonstrates the utility of hyperspectral radiometric measurements for the retrieval of near-surface phytoplankton properties(1), i.e., phytoplankton absorption spectra (a(ph)) and biomass evaluated through examining the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla). Using hyperspectral data (409-800 nm at similar to 5 nm resolution) and a class of neural networks known as Mixture Density Networks (MDN) (Pahlevan et al., 2020), we show that the median error in a(ph) retrievals is reduced two-to-three times (N = 722) compared to that from heritage ocean color algorithms. The median error associated with our a(ph) retrieval across all the visible bands varies between 20 and 30%. Similarly, Chla retrievals exhibit significant improvements (i.e., more than two times; N = 1902), with respect to existing algorithms that rely on select spectral bands. Using an independent matchup dataset acquired near-concurrently with the acquisition of the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) images, the models are found to perform well, but at reduced levels due to uncertainties in the atmospheric correction. The mapped spatial distribution of Chla maps and a(ph) spectra for selected HICO swaths further solidify MDNs as promising machine-learning models that have the potential to generate highly accurate aquatic remote sensing products in inland and coastal waters. For a(ph) retrieval to improve further, two immediate research avenues are recommended: a) the network architecture requires additional optimization to enable a simultaneous retrieval of multiple in-water parameters (e.g., a(ph), Chla, absorption by colored dissolved organic matter), and b) the training dataset should be extended to enhance model generalizability. This feasibility analysis using MDNs provides strong evidence that high-quality, global hyperspectral data will open new pathways toward a better understanding of biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems.

AB Cirrus clouds are commonly distributed in the atmosphere, and can lead to degradation of the ground information in optical remotely sensed images obtained using airborne and spaceborne sensors. A cirrus band on the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), i.e., Band 9, is designed to precisely detect cirrus cloud, providing a reference basis for the radiance calculation of cirrus cloud in other bands. Therefore, based on a scattering law, a cirrus cloud correction method is proposed in this paper to restore the ground information for Landsat 8 OLI visible and near-infrared (VNIR) images by comprehensively using the visible and cirrus bands. The scattering law and the high correlation between the two adjoining blue bands are combined to estimate each VNIR band's cirrus radiance. The relationship among the bands is constrained to comply with the scattering law. The differences between the ocean and land surfaces are also considered when determining the parameter in the scattering law. In the experiments conducted in this study, both simulated and acquired images contaminated with cirrus cloud were used to evaluate the proposed method, and both visual and quantitative evaluations were carried out to verify the performance. The results suggest that the cirrus cloud in the VNIR bands can be removed by the use of the proposed method. The ground information can also be adequately restored, with a mean absolute error of less than 0.7757 for the simulated data and a structural similarity index measure of greater than 0.8621 for the acquired data. When compared with three existing correction methods, the proposed method was able to obtain clearer and more accurate results over various land and ocean scenes. Furthermore, this method's applicability to other sensors with similar bands, such as the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument, was also investigated and validated.

AB In their applications, both deep learning techniques and object-based image analysis (OBIA) have shown better performance separately than conventional methods on change detection tasks. However, efforts to investigate the effect of combining these two techniques for advancing change detection techniques are unexplored in current literature. This study proposes a novel change detection method implementing change feature extraction using convolutional neural networks under an OBIA framework. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we compare the proposed method against benchmark pixel-based counterparts on aerial images for the task of multi-class change detection. To thoroughly assess the performance of our proposed method, this study also for the first time compared three common feature fusion schemes for change detection architecture: concatenation, differencing, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The proposed method was also tested on simulated misregistered images to evaluate its robustness, a factor that plays an important role in compromising change detection accuracy but has not been investigated for supervised change detection methods in the literature. Finally, the proposed change detection method was also tested using very high resolution (VHR) satellite images for binary class change detection to map an impacted area caused by natural disaster and the result was evaluated using reference data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). With the experimental results from these two sets of experiments, we showed that (1) our proposed method achieved substantially higher accuracy and computational efficiency when compared to pixel-based methods, (2) three feature fusion schemes did not show a significant difference for overall accuracy, (3) our proposed method was robust in image misregistration in both testing and training data, (4) we demonstrate the potential impact of automation to decision making by deploying our method to map a large geographic area affected by a recent natural disaster.

AB Accurate digital elevation models are key data products used to inform forest management. Light detection and ranging (lidar) technologies have emerged as a useful tool for acquiring detailed terrain information, although the accuracy of this data is known to vary with topographic complexity and the density and characteristics of overlying vegetation. Single Photon Lidar (SPL) provides a high-density point cloud that can be acquired from a much higher altitude than discrete return, small-footprint lidar (hereafter, linear-mode lidar or LML), providing efficiencies and potential cost savings for operational mapping programs. Herein, we assess the absolute and relative accuracies of leaf-on and leaf-off SPL data acquired at different altitudes for characterizing terrain under varying vegetation types and densities and compare to results for LML data. Our assessment was forest-focused and primarily point based, using 299 Real-Time Kinematic survey checkpoints to quantify elevation errors (Delta h); however, we also investigated and reported accuracy for linear transects, and conducted a wall-to-wall comparison of the SPL-derived 1-m digital elevation models (DEMs) against an LML-derived DEM. Point cloud characteristics for the leaf-on 2018 SPL data were markedly different, with 88% of returns as first returns, compared to 17% for the LML, and 59% and 46% for the leaf-off SPL data acquired at 3800 m and 2000 m, respectively. Of the datasets considered herein, the SPL data acquired under leaf-on conditions in 2018 had the lowest accuracy and precision for characterizing terrain underneath vegetation cover, with an RMSE of 10.97 cm and a 95th quantile of 24.03 cm; however these values are within commonly accepted error limits for elevation products. The leaf-off SPL data were most accurate overall; however, the differences between the leaf-off SPL data acquired at 3800 m versus 2000 m were often minor (< 1 cm on average), with similar patterns in Delta h between the two datasets (r = 0.8). In terms of the relative performance of the lidar datasets examined, results from the analyses of linear transects were similar to those of the checkpoints, but highlighted the variability in elevation accuracy within similar cover types. Wall-to-wall comparisons of the SPL-derived DEMs to the 2012 LML DEM also corroborated the results of the checkpoint assessment, with the 2018 SPL leaf-on DEM having the largest differences (mean difference = 7.44 cm; RMSD = 18.07 cm). Differences between DEMs did not trend consistently with increasing canopy cover or with the percentage of returns that were within +/- 15 cm of the ground surface. We found that it was not only the density of the vegetation, but also the composition and configuration of both the overstory and understory vegetation that influenced the accuracy with which the lidar characterized the terrain surface. Overall, our results indicated that leaf-on SPL is capable of capturing terrain information under a wide variety of forest and vegetation conditions, albeit at a lower accuracy than what is possible with leaf-on LML or leaf-off SPL, but at a level of accuracy that is within acceptable limits for most forest applications.

AB We have analyzed the effect of aerosols on the retrieval of the dry air mixing ratio of carbon dioxide (XCO2) in the Earth's atmosphere from instruments like OCO-2 and GOSAT. High-fidelity simulations of multi-angle spectropolarimetric observations in the O-2 A-band and the weak and strong CO2 bands are used to evaluate the information contained in different measurement subsets/synergies for the retrieval of aerosol, surface, and molecular parameters. We contrast the biases and uncertainties in the retrieved XCO2 resulting from the as-sumption of free or fixed aerosol microphysical parameters in the retrieval algorithm. It is very difficult to achieve the required retrieval accuracy of 0.2% for XCO2 using intensity-only Nadir mode measurements. The uncertainty in the retrieved XCO2 can be minimized by introducing multiangle and polarimetric measurement synergies. While the retrieval bias on XCO2 is practically eliminated by the addition of measurement synergies for free aerosol microphysical parameters, fixed aerosol retrievals can lead to an increase in XCO2 bias. In both cases, our full multi-angle polarimetric dataset produces a maximum uncertainty of similar to 1.6% in the retrieved XCO2 at low aerosol optical thicknesses and over dark surfaces. The XCO2 retrieval uncertainty improves to better than 0.2% at greater aerosol optical thickness and brighter surfaces. The problematic low aerosol optical thickness and low surface brightness regime produces an XCO2 bias of 1 - 8% for fixed aerosol microphysics, while the free parameters produce a maximum bias well under 10(-3)% for all retrieval scenes considered.

AB The urban heat island (UHI) is a major topic in the study of urban climates. However, comprehensive research on the atmospheric UHI (UHIAtm), surface UHI (UHISurf), and subsurface UHI (UHISub) simultaneously has yet not been reported. Using the MODIS land surface temperature and atmospheric profile data during the 2010-2016 period, we investigated the diurnal, seasonal, and vertical variations of UHIAtm, UHISurf, and UHISub in Beijing. The major findings include but are not limited to the following: As the altitude increases from 1000 hPa (near the surface) to 700 hPa (similar to 3 km), the daytime UHIAtm intensity in summer decreases piecewise linearly with a rapid decline above 850 hPa (similar to 1.5 km), while in spring and autumn it decreases after a slight increase in the lower atmosphere. The nighttime UHIAtm intensity decreases approximately linearly in all seasons with a rapid (gra-dual) decline in winter (summer). As the depth increases from the surface to similar to 0.2 m, the daytime intensity from UHISurf to UHISub decreases in summer but increases in the other seasons, while the nighttime trends are opposite to the daytime ones. The diurnal (seasonal) variation of UHISub intensity converges to the daily (annual) mean as the depth reaches similar to 0.5 m (10 m). These new findings have theoretical and practical implications for in-depth understanding of the urban thermal environment from the boundary layer to the subsurface.

AB Deriving inherent optical properties (IOPs) from multispectral imagery of shallow water environments using physics-based inversion models require prior knowledge of the spectral reflectance of the bottom substrate. The use of an incorrect bottom reflectance adversely affects the IOPs and, in part, the depth derived from inversion models. To date, an operational approach that determines the bottom reflectance from multispectral imagery is lacking; development in this area is especially paramount for locations that exhibit temporal variability in the spatial distributions of submerged aquatic vegetation and benthic microalgae. In this work, we develop a multispectral implementation of the HOPE-LUT algorithm (Hyperspectral Optimization Processing Exemplar with benthic Look Up Table), and apply the approach to MERIS imagery of the Great Bahama Bank (GBB). Overall benthic classification accuracy of this approach was 80.0%, revealing the areal coverage of benthic flora can range from 1052.3 km(2) to 6169.3 km(2) between years in the Exumas, GBB. Comparison of HOPE-LUT IOP retrievals to common inversion model implementations (particularly HOPE, with its default sand endmember) shows that using an incorrect bottom reflectance can lead to over-estimations in aphy(443) (absorption coefficient of phytoplankton at 443 nm), of up to 95%, under-estimations of adg(443) (absorption coefficient of detritus and gelbstoff) up to 50%, and over-estimations of depth up to 20%. In addition, the HOPE-LUT parameterizations generate IOPs within the range of those measured in situ. We demonstrate that, at the scale of a MERIS pixel, the dominant substrates of seagrass, unattached bottom macroalgae and benthic microalgae are spectrally unresolvable at the depths that these classes occur in the GBB. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of commonly used atmospheric corrections algorithms for bathymetry estimation and benthic classification accuracy. The combined benthic classification and inversion scheme presented here is autonomous, i.e., it does not require scene-specific thresholds or modifications. Thus, it should be portable to Sentinel 3 OLCI and potentially MODIS Aqua imagery to obtain a continuous time series of changes in IOPs and benthic cover for the shallow waters over the Great Bahama Bank.

AB Near real-time monitoring of forest disturbance is a critical tool for combating illegal logging. The only feasible data sources for near real-time monitoring over large area are remote sensing data, and historically the only sensors with repeat times sufficient for near-real time monitoring are from coarse-resolution sensors such as MODIS. The MODIS sensors onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites have provided near daily global observations in the red and NIR spectral bands at 250 m resolution since 1999. While their longevity is impressive, the sensors are nearing the end of their lifespan and the MODIS data record will be continued by the VIIRS sensor onboard Suomi NPP. But because of the spatial and spectral differences between MODIS and VIIRS, it is worth investigating whether VIIRS can replace MODIS as input data for near real-time monitoring. In this article, we compared the performance of the NRT-CCDC (Near Real-Time Continuous Change Detection and Classification) algorithm using the Terra/ and Aqua/MODIS composites at 250 m resolution, Terra/MODIS 250 m and 500 m surface reflectance, Aqua/MODIS 250 m and 500 m surface reflectance, and VIIRS 500 m surface reflectance. We found that the algorithm using composites from both MODIS sensors and Terra/MODIS data at 250 m resolution outperformed the results obtained when using VIIRS data. The results were similar when using 500 m data from Terra/MODIS alone compared to VIIRS data. We found that a morning overpass, like that of Terra, is preferable to an afternoon overpass, which is employed by VIIRS and Aqua. Spatial and temporal resolution of the input data are two key factors in successful near real-time monitoring of forest disturbance.

AB L-band (1.25 GHz) radar measurements of a soybean canopy indicate that the emergence of seed pods is a significant contributor to the backscatter during the late stages of the growing season. In order to validate the measured data, a realistic scattering model of the soybean canopy is developed. The parameters of the soybean canopy and underlying soil used in the model vary over the growing season based on in situ measurements. Scattering amplitudes for soybean leaves are modeled analytically by using a thin disk approximation; stem and pods are jointly modeled using a numerical electromagnetic field solver. These scattering amplitudes are together incorporated into a coherent scattering model to obtain the backscattering coefficient for VVand HHpolarizations. The modeling results show good agreement with the radar field measurements, having RMSEs of 0.51 dB for VV-pol and 1.1 dB for HH-pol. Both measured data and modeled results show that the change of soil moisture can be accurately monitored by L-band backscatter. It is also found that the difference between HHand VV-polarized backscatter increases as the size of the soybean pods becomes larger. A method is developed here to estimate the number of pods in a soybean canopy based on polarimetric radar backscatter at L-band.

AB Mapping inundation dynamics and flooding extent is important for a wide variety of applications, from providing disaster relief and predicting infectious disease transmission to quantifying the effects of climate change on Earth's hydrologic cycle. Due to the rapid and highly spatially heterogeneous nature of flooding events, acquiring data with both high spatial and temporal resolutions is paramount, yet doing so has remained a challenge in satellite remote sensing. The potential for Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) to help address this challenge has been explored in several studies, the bulk of which use data from the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) constellation of GNSS-R satellites. This work presents a simple forward model that describes how surface reflectivity measured by CYGNSS should change due to flooding for different land surface types. We corroborate our model findings with observations from the Amazon Basin and Lake Eyre, Australia. Both the model and observations indicate that the relationship between surface reflectivity and surface water extent strongly depends on the micro-scale surface roughness of the land and water. We show that the increase in surface reflectivity due to flooding or inundation is greatest in areas where the surrounding land has dense vegetation. In areas where the land surface surrounding inundated areas is perfectly smooth, the increase in surface reflectivity due to flooding is not as strong, and confounding effects of soil moisture and water roughness could lead to large uncertainties in resulting surface water retrievals. However, even a few centimeters of surface roughness will result in several dB sensitivity to surface water, provided that the water is smoother than the land surface itself.

AB Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) has been used during the past decade to capture the complexity of 3D forest canopy structures, especially Leaf or Plant Area Density (LAD/PAD). TLS data, i.e. point cloud, can be divided into voxels to estimate the three-dimensional distribution of LAD/PAD. However, the combination effects of vegetation occlusion and shooting pattern of TLS scanners lead to a highly heterogeneous sampling, which limits the reliability of some local estimates, since several voxels are either not explored or poorly-explored by laser beams. In practice, recommendations vary regarding the minimum number of beams crossing voxels or the minimum path lengths required to provide reliable predictions. In addition, assigning a value to non-explored and poorly-explored voxels is still an open question.
   The present work proposes a new method, called LAD-kriging, to mitigate the impact of non-uniform sampling and to increase the accuracy of LAD estimates in non-explored and poorly-explored voxels. The method takes advantage of i) an unbiased LAD estimator of known variance, which was recently developed; ii) the spatial correlation of the LAD field, which derives from vegetation clumping. LAD-kriging computes kriging weights from mathematical derivations, which takes into account both spatial dependencies in the LAD field and the reliability of the estimate available in each voxel. It was evaluated through numerical experiments, which enabled to validate the algorithm and to evaluate its performance through comparison with true references. An example application to field data shows that such spatial correlations truly exist in the field and that LAD-kriging entails to reduce sampling errors (with respect to full resolution scanning). Although a real validation is impossible due to the lack of precise references at the voxel scale, this example allows to gain confidence for its application to field data.
   In our realistic numerical experiment, up to 25-30% of voxels can be explored by<100 beams, thereby leading to unreliable estimates of the LAD within these voxels and frequent large local errors. In cases where voxels were not explored at all, simple methods previously reported in earlier studies, such as ignoring occlusion or assigning "mean layer" values to unexplored voxels were inefficient (RMSE = 0.72 m(-1) and poor local accuracy). By contrast, LAD-kriging exhibited the smallest errors (RMSE = 0.48 m(-1)) and was locally more accurate. LAD-Kriging was also efficient for correcting voxels explored with few beams, i.e. unreliable, dropping RMSE from 0.92 to 0.42 m(-1) in these volumes. In practice, LAD-Kriging does not require defining a reliability threshold or any arbitrary parameterization, which is convenient for field applications and can be extended to other applications than LAD with TLS, such as UAS/VAS scanning, provided that unbiased estimators of known variance are available.

AB Crop emergence date is a critical input to models of crop development and biomass accumulation. The ability to robustly detect and map emergence date using remote sensing would greatly benefit operational yield estimation and crop monitoring efforts; however, this has proven to be challenging. Previous remote-sensing phenology algorithms showed that crop stages can typically be detected starting only around the V3-V4 (3 to 4 established leaves) vegetative stage. Furthermore, traditional approaches have a strong assumption regarding the temporal evolution of plant growth and normally require a complete growth period of observations to define seasonal changes. Most approaches were not designed for within-season operational mapping, particularly in the early growing season. In the current paper, we describe a new within-season emergence (WISE) approach to mapping crop green-up date using satellite observations available during early growth stages. The approach was first optimized using high spatiotemporal resolution (10 m, 2-day revisit) imagery from the Vegetation and Environment monitoring New MicroSatellite (VEN mu S) research mission, and assessed using ground observations of early crop growth stages (emergence VE and one leaf V1 stages for corn, and emergence VE and unifoliolate VC stages for soybeans) collected over the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC) experimental fields in Beltsville, MD during the 2019 growing season. Results show that early crop growth stages can be reliably detected at sub-field scale about two weeks after crop emergence. The remote-sensing green-up dates were about 4-5 days after crop emergence on average. Coefficients of determination (R-2) between green-up dates and the mid-point dates of the early growth stages were above 0.90. The mean absolute differences, standard deviations, and root mean square errors comparing to the early growth stage mid-point dates were within six days. The maximum differences were within +/- 10 days across all fields. The WISE approach was assessed using operational Sentinel-2 data (10 m, 5-day revisit) over BARC. The detected green-up dates from Sentinel-2 were consistent with those from VEN mu S. Some fields were not detected due to the lack of observations around the emergence dates. For independent evaluation, the WISE approach was applied over an agricultural watershed on the Maryland Eastern Shore using both VEN mu S and the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data (30 m, 3-4-day revisit). The detected green-up dates were compared with emergence dates in crop progress reports from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) at the state-level. The WISE-detected green-up dates at the regional scale are within VE stage ranges but slightly earlier than NASS crop progress reports at the state-level. The WISE approach uses remote-sensing observations during the early crop growth stages and has potential for operational application within the season using Sentinel-2 and HLS data.

   surface reflectance products
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB Many derived Earth Observation products share surface reflectance as a common step in their processing chains. This makes the maintenance and improvement of surface reflectance product quality of fundamental importance to ensure information derived from these downstream products can be trusted. Despite this, the literature is relatively light on the implementation of validation methodologies designed for surface reflectance. In response to the need to improve general EO validation methodologies, the concept of fiducial reference measurements (FRM) was created that would produce validation data that is fully characterised and independent, with associated uncertainties, and traceable to SI.
   This paper describes a field campaign designed to produce surface reflectance validation data, in line with the FRM ideology, for validating the Sentinel-2 L2A (S2) and Proba-V S1-TOC (Proba) surface reflectance products. The key methodological procedures are outlined in detail to facilitate uptake of FRM methods in future validation studies. These include the calibration and characterisation of field instruments, the field measurement protocol, and uncertainty propagation.
   Comparison of S2 with field measurements showed agreement within the stated uncertainties present for all bands and locations at the pixel and area scales. The Proba comparison results demonstrated a general disagreement within the stated uncertainties. However, there is a lack of uncertainty information provided by the product as well as publicly available product uncertainty requirements which mean that it is difficult to assess this fully. The aim of this practical demonstration of FRM-based surface reflectance validation, that utilises metrological practices for uncertainty characterisation, is to encourage the adoption of these procedures in future land surface reflectance validation studies and operational activities.

AB A new method, combining empirical modeling with time series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data, is proposed to provide an assessment of potential landslide volume and area. The method was developed to evaluate potential landslides in the Heitai river terrace of the Yellow River in central Gansu Province, China. The elevated terrace has a substantial loess cover and along the terrace edges many landslides have been triggered by gradually rising groundwater levels following continuous irrigation since 1968. These landslides can have significant impact on communities, affecting lives and livelihoods. Developing effective landslide risk management requires better understanding of potential landslide magnitude. Fifty mapped landslides were used to construct an empirical power-law relationship linking landslide area (A(L)) to volume (V-L) (V-L = 0.333 x A(L)(1.399)). InSAR-derived ground displacement ranges from -64 mm/y to 24 mm/y along line of sight (LOS). Further interpretation of patterns based on remote sensing (InSAR & optical image) and field survey enabled the identification of an additional 54 potential landslides (1.9 x 10(2) m(2) <= A(L) <= 8.1 x 10(4) m(2)). In turn this enabled construction of a map that shows the magnitude of potential landslide activity. This research provides significant further scientific insights to inform landslide hazard and risk management, in a context of ongoing landscape evolution. It also provides further evidence that this methodology can be used to quantify the magnitude of potential landslides and thus contribute essential information towards landslide risk management.

AB Accurate and consistent broad-scale mapping of fire severity is an important resource for fire management as well as fire-related ecological and climate change research. Remote sensing and machine learning approaches present an opportunity to enhance accuracy and efficiency of current practices. Quantitative biophysical models of photosynthetic, non-photosynthetic and bare cover fractions have not been widely applied to fire severity studies but may provide greater consistency in comparisons of different fires across the landscape compared to reflectance-based indices. We systematically tested and compared reflectance and fractional cover candidate severity indices derived from Sentinel 2 satellite imagery using a random forest (RF) machine learning framework. Assessment of predictive power (cross-validation) was undertaken to quantify the accuracy of mapping severity of new fires. The effect of environmental variables on the accuracy of the RF predicted severity classification was examined to assess the stability of the mapping across the landscape. The results indicate that fire severity can be mapped with very high accuracy using Sentinel 2 imagery and RF supervised classification. The mean accuracy was >95% for the unburnt and extreme severity class (complete crown consumption), >85% for high severity class (full crown scorch), >80% for low severity (burnt understory, unburnt canopy) and >70% for the moderate severity class (partial canopy scorch). Higher canopy cover and higher topographic complexity was associated with a higher rate of under-prediction, due to the limitations of optical sensors in viewing the burnt understorey of low severity classes under these conditions. Further research is aimed at improving classification accuracy of low and moderate severity classes and applying the RF algorithm to hazard reduction fires.

AB Technical advancements have widened the limits of remote sensing in mapping shallow water benthic habitats and bathymetry over the last decades. On the other hand, the needs of shallow water remote sensing have pushed instrument development. In this manuscript we provide 50-year retrospective of the developments in the field in terms of both instrumentation and methods. We also show that spectral features characteristic of the main benthic groups in shallow water are consistent from the tropics to sub-arctic regions and from salty to freshwaters. The fundamental limiting factor in both benthic mapping and bathymetry is absorption of light by water molecules. However, spectral absorption by water molecules is the key to bathymetry derivation. Variable backscattering by particles and absorption by dissolved organic matter is a confounding factor for all objectives. The combination of using the spectral and textural characteristics of bottom features and our knowledge about these features have now resulted in the ability to map habitats over large coastal systems. This manuscript has shown that optically shallow water remote sensing has reached levels where the satellite derived bathymetry and habitat maps are accepted by different end users (including the International Maritime Organisation) and are routinely used in ecological studies, monitoring and management of coastal environments.

AB Land cover mixture at moderate- to coarse-resolution is an important cause for the uncertainty of global leaf area index (LAI) products. The accuracy of LAI retrievals over land-water mixed pixels is adversely impacted because water absorbs considerable solar radiation and thus can greatly lower pixel-level reflectance especially in the near-infrared wavelength. Here we proposed an approach named Reduced Water Effect (RWE) to improve the accuracy of LAI retrievals by accounting for water-induced negative bias in reflectances. The RWE consists of three parts: water area fraction (WAF) calculation, subpixel water reflectance computation in land-water mixed pixels and LAI retrieval using the operational MODIS LAI algorithm. The performance of RWE was carefully evaluated using the aggregated Landsat ETM+ reflectance of water pixels over different regions and observation dates and the aggregated 30-m LAI reference maps over three sites in the moderate-resolution pixel grid (500-m). Our results suggest that the mean absolute errors of water endmember reflectance in red and NIR bands were both < 0.016, which only introduced mean absolute (relative) errors of < 0.15 (15%) for the pixel-level LAI retrievals. The validation results reveal that the accuracy of RWE LAI was higher than that of MODIS LAI over land-water mixed pixels especially for pixels with larger WAFs. Additionally, the mean relative difference between RWE LAI and aggregated 30-m LAI did not vary with WAF, indicating that water effects were significantly reduced by the RWE method. A comparison between RWE and MODIS LAI shows that the maximum absolute and relative differences caused by water effects were 0.9 and 100%, respectively. Furthermore, the impact of water mixed in pixels can induce the LAI underestimation and change the day selected for compositing the 8-day LAI product. These results indicate that RWE can effectively reduce water effects on the LAI retrieval of land-water mixed pixels, which is promising for the improvement of global LAI products.

AB Satellite observations for the Arctic and boreal region may contain information of vegetation, soil, snow, snowmelt, and/or other surface water bodies. We investigated the impacts of vegetation, soil, snow and surface water on empirical vegetation/snow indices on a tundra ecosystem area located around Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow) of Alaska with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images in 2001-2014. Empirical vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), the index of near infrared of vegetation (NIRv), and modified EVI (EVI2), have been used to monitor vegetation. Normalized difference snow index (NDSI) has been widely applied to monitor snow. The vegetation cover fraction (VGCF), the soil cover fraction (SOILCF), the snow cover fraction (SNOWCF), the surface water body cover fraction (WaterBodyCF), the fractional absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by vegetation chlorophyll (fAPAR(chl)), the fractional absorption of PAR by non-chlorophyll components of the vegetation (fAPAR(non-chl)), and the fractional absorption of PAR by the entire canopy (fAPAR(canopy)) are retrieved with the MODIS images and a coupled Leaf-Vegetation-Soil-Snow-Surface water body radiative transfer model, LVS3. The vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, EVI2 and NIRv) differ from VGCF, fAPAR(chl), fAPAR(non-chl), and fAPAR(canopy). In addition to vegetation, we find that soil, snow and surface water also have impacts on vegetation indices NDVI, EVI (EVI2), and NIRv. Presence of snow makes lower the observed values of NDVI, EVI2 and NIRv. After snowmelt is gone, the vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, EVI2 and NIRv) linearly decrease with SOILCF and WaterBodyCF, and WaterBodyCF has stronger impacts on these vegetation indices than SOILCF. The relationship between EVI and snow is complicated. NDSI non-linearly increases with SNOWCF, but linearly increases with sum of SNOWCF and WaterBodyCF (sum = 0.5893 x NDSI +0.4342, R-2 = 0.976). NDSI linearly decreases with VGCF, and the relationship between NDSI and SOILCF is complex. Retrievals of VGCF, fAPAR(chl), fAPAR(non-chl) and fAPAR(canopy) with the LVS3 model provide alternatives for vegetation monitoring and ecological modeling.

AB The accurate representation of spatio-temporal patterns of precipitation is an essential input for numerous environmental applications. However, the estimation of precipitation patterns derived solely from rain gauges is subject to large uncertainties. We present the Random Forest based MErging Procedure (RF-MEP), which combines information from ground-based measurements, state-of-the-art precipitation products, and topography-related features to improve the representation of the spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation, especially in data-scarce regions. RF-MEP is applied over Chile for 2000-2016, using daily measurements from 258 rain gauges for model training and 111 stations for validation. Two merged datasets were computed: RF-MEP3P (based on PERSIANN-CDR, ERA-Interim, and CHIRPSv2) and RF-MEP5P (which additionally includes CMORPHv1 and TRMM 3B42v7). The performances of the two merged products and those used in their computation were compared against MSWEPv2.2, which is a state-of-the-art global merged product. A validation using ground-based measurements was applied at different temporal scales using both continuous and categorical indices of performance. RF-MEP3P and RF-MEP5P outperformed all the precipitation datasets used in their computation, the products derived using other merging techniques, and generally outperformed MSWEPv2.2. The merged P products showed improvements in the linear correlation, bias, and variability of precipitation at different temporal scales, as well as in the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, the frequency bias, and the critical success index for different precipitation intensities. RF-MEP performed well even when the training dataset was reduced to 10% of the available rain gauges. Our results suggest that RF-MEP could be successfully applied to any other region and to correct other climatological variables, assuming that ground-based data are available.

AB The kappa coefficient is not an index of accuracy, indeed it is not an index of overall agreement but one of agreement beyond chance. Chance agreement is, however, irrelevant in an accuracy assessment and is anyway inappropriately modelled in the calculation of a kappa coefficient for typical remote sensing applications. The magnitude of a kappa coefficient is also difficult to interpret. Values that span the full range of widely used interpretation scales, indicating a level of agreement that equates to that estimated to arise from chance alone all the way through to almost perfect agreement, can be obtained from classifications that satisfy demanding accuracy targets (e.g. for a classification with overall accuracy of 95% the range of possible values of the kappa coefficient is -0.026 to 0.900). Comparisons of kappa coefficients are particularly challenging if the classes vary in their abundance (i.e. prevalence) as the magnitude of a kappa coefficient reflects not only agreement in labelling but also properties of the populations under study. It is shown that all of the arguments put forward for the use of the kappa coefficient in accuracy assessment are flawed and/or irrelevant as they apply equally to other, sometimes easier to calculate, measures of accuracy. Calls for the kappa coefficient to be abandoned from accuracy assessments should finally be heeded and researchers are encouraged to provide a set of simple measures and associated outputs such as estimates of per-class accuracy and the confusion matrix when assessing and comparing classification accuracy.

AB Antarctic pack-ice seals, a group of four species of true seals (Phocidae), play a pivotal role in the Southern Ocean foodweb as wide-ranging predators of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba). Due to their circumpolar distribution and the remoteness and vastness of their habitat, little is known about their population sizes. Estimating pack-ice seal population sizes and trends is key to understanding how the Southern Ocean ecosystem will react to threats such as climate change driven sea ice loss and krill fishing. We present a functional pack-ice seal detection pipeline using Worldview-3 imagery and a Convolutional Neural Network that counts and locates seal centroids. We propose a new CNN architecture that detects objects by combining semantic segmentation heatmaps with binary classification and counting by regression. Our pipeline locates over 30% of seals, when compared to consensus counts from human experts, and reduces the time required for seal detection by 95% (assuming just a single GPU). While larger training sets and continued algorithm development will no doubt improve classification accuracy, our pipeline, which can be easily adapted for other large-bodied animals visible in sub-meter satellite imagery, demonstrates the potential for machine learning to vastly expand our capacity for regular pack-ice seal surveys and, in doing so, will contribute to ongoing international efforts to monitor pack-ice seals.

AB An urban air temperature model is presented using the enterprise GOES-16 land surface temperature product. The model is constructed by fitting the difference between ground-truth air temperature data against satellite LST using a Gaussian function. A time-match algorithm aligns the ground and satellite measurements within 5-min of one another, and the resulting matched values are compared over ten months to investigate their correlation. Land cover, latitude, longitude, local time, and elevation are input to a regressive neural network to fit each unique GOES-16 pixel according to ground-based properties. Over 150 ground stations and satellite pixels throughout the continental U.S. are used near urban areas to construct the diurnal Gaussian relationship and approximate air temperature. Statistics from a five month validation period generates an RMSE of 2.6 K, a bias of 0.8 K, and R-2 of 0.86, which are in strong competition with other studies at lower resolution, less geographic integration, and less temporal resolvability. The algorithm also produced strong spatial correlations with a high resolution numerical model, resulting in a mean RMSE value of 2.1 K for nearly 7000 pixels. The overall presentation of this model aims to simplify the calculation of air temperature from satellite LST and create a successful model that performs well in heterogeneous environments. The improvement of urban air temperature calculations will also result in improved satellite land surface products such as relative humidity and heat index.

TI A reporting framework for Sustainable Development Goal 15: Multi-scale
   monitoring of forest degradation using MODIS, Landsat and Sentinel data

AB Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.1.1 proposes to quantify "Forest area as a proportion of total land area" in order to achieve SDG target 15.1. While area under forest cover can provide useful information regarding discrete changes in forest cover, it does not provide any insight on subtle changes within the broad vegetation class, e.g. forest degradation. Continental or national-level studies, mostly utilizing coarse-scale satellite data, are likely to fail in capturing these changes due to the fine spatial and long temporal characteristics of forest degradation. Yet, these long-term changes affect forest structure, composition and function, thus ultimately limiting successful implementation of SDG targets.
   Using a multi-scale, satellite-based monitoring approach, our goal is to provide an easy-to-implement reporting framework for South Asian forest ecosystems. We systematically analyze freely available remote sensing assets on Google Earth Engine for monitoring degradation and evaluate the potential of multiple satellite data with different spatial resolutions for reporting forest degradation. Taking a broad-brush approach in step 1, we calculate vegetation trends in six south Asian countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during 2000-2016. We also calculate rainfall trends in these countries using the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) rainfall data, and further calculate Rain-Use Efficiency (RUE) that shows vegetation trends in the context of rainfall variability. In step 2, we focus on two protected area test cases from India and Sri Lanka for evaluating the potential of finer-resolution satellite data compared to MODIS, i.e. Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 data, for capturing forest degradation signals, which will ultimately contribute towards SDG indicators 15.1.1 and 15.1.2. We find that most countries show a fluctuating trend in vegetation condition over the years, along with localized greening and browning. The Random Forest (RF) classifier utilized in step 2 was able to generate accurate maps (87% and 91% overall accuracy for Indian and Sri Lankan test cases, respectively) of non-intact forest within the protected areas. We find that almost one-third of the Indian test case is degraded forest, even though it shows overall greening as per the broad-brush approach. This finding corroborates our argument that utilizing higher-resolution satellite data (e.g. 10-m) than those normally used for national-level studies will be crucial for reporting SDG indicator 15.2.1: "progress towards sustainable forest management".

AB Strong earthquakes, especially in continental mountainous areas, can trigger extensive mass wasting, producing large amounts of debris that accumulates along the hillslopes or in drainage channels. The coseismic deposits and disturbed slopes are prone to be reactivated or remobilized by heavy rainfalls in the subsequent years after the earthquake. Predicting how long post-seismic landslide activity will return to the pre-earthquake level is a key to risk assessment and management. However, this is still poorly understood, and lacks quantitative prediction approach. The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake triggered an unprecedented number of landslides, creating an extraordinary natural laboratory to investigate the evolution of post-seismic landslides and their impacts on environment. Using the vegetation recovery rate as an indicator, we present the observational evidence of the post-seismic landslide evolution based on MODIS NDVI time series between 2000 and 2018. Using a simple vegetation recovery rate (VRR) function, we quantify the rate of vegetation regrowth in the Wenchuan earthquake affected area, and discuss the decaying trend of post-seismic landslide activities. Our findings show that 83% of the co-seismic landslides become inactive within a decade. The NDVI trend suggests that landslide activity may return to the pre-earthquake level within 18 years. The sensitivity of vegetation regrowth to post-seismic landsliding thus offers a great potential to improve our understanding of the spatio-temporal evolution of the post-seismic landslide activities.

AB Soil degradation on Alpine grasslands is triggered mainly by extreme topography, prevailing climate conditions and land use practices. Suitable monitoring tools are required to assess soil erosion with high temporal and spatial resolution. In this study, we present an unprecedented and comprehensive approach based on objectbased image analysis (OBIA) to map and assess all occurring erosion processes within a catchment (Urseren Valley, Switzerland). Five high-resolution (0.25-0.5 m) orthophotos with RGB spectral information (SwissImage) produced during a 16-yr period were analyzed. Soil erosion sites are classified according to their type (shallow landslide or sites with reduced vegetation cover affected by sheet erosion) or the triggering land use management impacts (haying, trampling) with the Overall Accuracy ranging between 78 and 88% (Kappa 0.65-0.81) for the different years. The area affected by soil erosion increases for all classes during the study period (2000-2016) by a total of 156 +/- 18% (increase consisting of 3% shallow landslides, 5% livestock trails, 46% sheet erosion and 46% management effects). Slopes at lower elevations ( < 1800 m asl) are increasingly affected by livestock trails and sheet erosion caused by trampling and grazing as well as other management practices. For areas located above the agricultural land use, an increase in shallow landslides, as well as sheet erosion, can be observed. This points to climate change as a triggering factor of soil degradation, which has not been identified so far as a factor for soil erosion in the Urseren Valley. While OBIA yields conservative estimations mainly due to limitations of spatial resolutions, the method facilitates a comprehensive overview of the ongoing temporal and spatial development regarding soil degradation within the Urseren Valley.

AB Above-Ground Biomass (AGB) product calibration and validation require ground reference plots at hectometric scales to match space-borne missions' resolution. Traditional forest inventory methods that use allometric equations for single tree AGB estimation suffer from biases and low accuracy, especially when dealing with large trees. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) and explicit tree modelling show high potential for direct estimates of tree volume, but at the cost of time demanding fieldwork. This study aimed to assess if novel Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Laser Scanning (UAV-LS) could overcome this limitation, while delivering comparable results. For this purpose, the performance of UAV-LS in comparison with TLS for explicit tree modelling was tested in a Dutch temperate forest. In total, 200 trees with Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) ranging from 6 to 91 cm from 5 stands, including coniferous and deciduous species, have been scanned, segmented and subsequently modelled with TreeQSM. TreeQSM is a method that builds explicit tree models from laser scanner point clouds. Direct comparison with TLS derived models showed that UAV-LS reliably modelled the volume of trunks and branches with diameter > 30 cm in the mature beech and oak stand with Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.85 and RMSE of1.12 m(3). Including smaller branch volume led to a considerable overestimation and decrease in correspondence to CCC of 0.51 and increase in RMSE to 6.59 m(3). Denser stands prevented sensing of trunks and further decreased CCC to 0.36 in the Norway spruce stand. Also small, young trees posed problems by preventing a proper depiction of the trunk circumference and decreased CCC to 0.01. This dependence on stand indicated a strong impact of canopy structure on the UAV-LS volume modelling capacity. Improved flight paths, repeated acquisition flights or alternative modelling strategies could improve UAV-LS modelling performance under these conditions. This study contributes to the use of UAV-LS for fast tree volume and AGB estimation on scales relevant for satellite AGB product calibration and validation.

AB Cities are responsible for 70% of fossil fuel CO2 emissions (FFCO2), and these emissions are poorly monitored. As a result, the use of spaceborne observation as a tool for addressing urban FFCO2 emissions has intensified. This work aims to understand the suitability of modern spaceborne remote sensing for capturing CO2 urban enhancement and for monitoring FFCO2 emissions from cities. We have used the first four years of observations from NASA Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) to collect CO2 urban anomalies (XCO2ano) from large cities (> 500 km(2) area) by combining urban-to-rural gradient and statistical filtering approaches. Approximately half of all XCO2ano (44%) were significant and noise-free to meet the accuracy requirements for city-scale applications. We captured positive CO2 enhancement over urban areas compared to background at a global scale. Median XCO2ano estimates were positive at 1.07 +/- 0.80 ppm (worldwide), 1.05 +/- 0.80 ppm (Northern Hemisphere), and 0.96 +/- 0.80 ppm (Southern Hemisphere). Most monthly XCO2ano (similar to 83%) emerged in four regions of the Northern Hemisphere (East Asia, Europe, North America, and South Asia), where most cities with strong emissions are located. We report that the XCO2ano from numerous cities have a moderate linear relationship with city size (r = 0.54-0.65) and FFCO2 strength (r = 0.64). As expected, five out of the six strongest XCO2ano were found over the megacities ( > 10 million population) of Los Angeles (2.04 +/- 0.91 ppm), Tehran (1.94 +/- 1.54 ppm), Rhine-Main Metropolitan Area (1.51 +/- 0.59 ppm), Pearl River Delta (1.48 +/- 1.11 ppm), and Seoul (1.47 +/- 1.72 ppm), with Houston (1.50 +/- 0.72 ppm) as the only non-megacity. Overall, we have shown that spaceborne remote sensing of XCO2 is suitable for capturing CO2 enhancement over a wide range of cities (especially in the Northern Hemisphere). Though we registered the global-scale urban footprint in CO2 signal and demonstrated the sensitivity of XCO2ano to city size and FFCO2, spaceborne remote sensing is still limited in its provision of columnar CO2 enhancement which is fundamentally linked with underlying urban emissions. This linkage may be more effectively addressed when spaceborne remote sensing becomes increasingly optimized for city-scale applications.

AB Internal temperature is an essential parameter for understanding ice sheet dynamics. Glaciological models provide estimations of temperature profiles over Antarctica and few boreholes are also available, but, at present, no measurement exists at the scale of the whole continent. The analysis of passive L-band observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite shows that, thanks to the high penetration depth (i.e. up to 1500 m), it is possible to infer information on in depth glaciological properties of the ice sheet including temperature. In this study, the temperature profile is retrieved from SMOS observations using jointly glaciological and emission models. The developed methodology is valid in the inner part of Antarctica where the ice sheet is almost stable (i.e. its velocity is limited to 10 m yr(-1)). This analysis points out that in several cases, differences are observed between retrieved temperature profiles and those predicted by glaciological models. In particular, some geophysical parameters, namely the geothermal heat flux and the mean annual accumulation, need to be modified with respect to their prior values in order to simulate SMOS brightness temperatures. Results also clearly show that the reliability of the retrieved profile in depth decreases with increasing ice thickness due to the limited penetration of microwaves in the ice. The obtained results prove the capability of L band (1.4 GHz) passive microwave sensors for investigating the internal temperature of the ice-sheet.

AB To elucidate the potential of hyperspectral remote sensing for estimating the functional leaf traits in East Asian forests, we investigated the utility of leaf spectroscopy and partial least square regression (PLSR) models for 141 tree species distributed widely across cool temperate to tropical climate zones in the Pacific region. In 14 forests in Japan, Thailand, and Malaysia, leaf samples at various developmental stages (young, mature, and senescent) were collected from two plant functional types (deciduous and evergreen species). The target leaf traits were leaf mass per unit area and concentrations of nitrogen (N), carbon (C), total phenol, cellulose, and lignin. The leaf reflectance at visible-short wave infrared spectral reflectance from 400 nm to 2395 nm was measured at 3-10-nm intervals (351 bands) using a spectral radiometer. First, we compared the performance of the PLSR models in terms of dry mass (DM)-based concentration and leaf area (LA)-based concentration. Then, we investigated the applicability of the models based on the different plant functional types and leaf developmental stages of the training dataset. Finally, we evaluated the minimum number of spectral bands needed for stable performance of the PLSR model by changing the used bands in accordance with the variable importance of projection (VIP) and equal interval resampling.
   The coefficient of determination (R-2) was higher and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) tended to be lower for all chemical trait concentrations expressed based on LA than for those based on DM, except for the case of leaf N. Plant functional type in the training data affected the applicability of the estimation model strongly. The estimation error increased when the functional type in the training dataset differed from that of the target tree species. In the PLSR model calibrated using datasets of evergreen tree species, the NRMSEs of the six traits were 8.0-12.6% for evergreen tree species but 10.4-21.1% for deciduous tree species. A similar trend was observed in the model calibrated for deciduous tree species. The model calibrated using both functional types showed intermediate accuracy for both types of tree species (NRMSE = 5.3-13.5%). The developmental stage of training data also affected the model performance, and the model calibrated using all of the stages showed better estimation accuracies for young and senescent leaves than the model calibrated from the data of mature leaves alone.
   The equal interval resampling provided better estimation accuracy than the case using the threshold of the VIP value although the model performance tended to be diminished with the reduction of input waveband in both methods. Using at least 104 bands with equal interval removal at a 20-nm interval confers similar performance of the PLSR model compared to the model with full wavebands. This study is the first to describe the potential of leaf spectroscopy for trait estimation of East Asian forest tree species, and our findings suggest that training datasets of typical functional types and varied developmental stages are important for estimation of leaf traits through the several biomes distributed widely in East Asia.

AB Recent satellite retrieval of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) has provided promising information for constraining carbon flux simulation with terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs). For this purpose, it is necessary to implement a SIF model in TBMs. SIF emerging from leaves generally undergoes multiple scattering processes within a canopy. However, it remains unclear how canopy scattering impacts observed SIF, which is used to constrain regional and global GPP modeling. Here, we developed an efficient scheme to account for the canopy scattering in a SIF model. Then we coupled this mechanistic representation of SIF to Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) and evaluated the new model (BEPS-SIF) simulations with ground and satellite-based SIF measurements. The results showed that BEPS-SIF reproduced global patterns of SIF observed by a satellite sensor and captured the seasonality of SIF reasonably well over different regions. The canopy scattering effects on the relationship between SIF and gross primary productivity (GPP) were also examined at the global scale using the BEPS-SIF model. We confirmed that SIF emitted from leaves was more directly linked to GPP globally than the observed canopy-leaving SIF, with higher improvements of the coefficient of determination (R-2) in dense vegetated regions and lower improvements of R-2 in sparse vegetated regions. This study highlights the importance of implementing the canopy scattering effect in a fluorescence model of TBMs and the need to account for this effect in the use of satellite SIF data for constraining global GPP modeling.

AB In mountainous regions slope and aspect result in variations in the illumination condition and the same land cover type can therefore show differences in the reflectance depending on the orientation of the terrain slope towards the sun and the sensor of the satellite. Different topographic illumination correction methods exist and their performance varies depending on e.g. sun zenith and land cover type. Similarly a variety of evaluation criteria exist to assess the performance of the topographic correction methods and each evaluation criteria usually only considers certain aspects of the ability of the topographic correction method in reducing signal-to-noise. In this article we present a novel framework for the evaluation of topographically corrected image composites using cloud computing. We evaluated six topographic correction methods (Bin Tan, C-Correction, Minnaert with slope, Sun-Canopy-Sensor plus C-Correction, Statistical-Empirical, and Variable Empirical Coefficient Algorithm) in forest areas of four Landsat footprints in Nepal for a time series of image composites from 1988 to 2016. Our evaluation shows that the Statistical-Empirical topographic correction method provides the best overall performance, but in some years and footprints also other methods can show the best performance. We discuss these differences and related reasons in detail and give recommendations on the best use and evaluation of topographic correction methods.

AB Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) information alone is insufficient for species-specific prediction of forest stand attributes, and therefore auxiliary optical image features (OIF) are commonly used to decrease the prediction errors associated with species-specific tree attributes. However, this requires collection and merging of two data sources, LiDAR and OIF, which increases the costs of the inventory. The recently introduced multispectral LiDAR (M-ALS) provides a potential single-sensor solution for obtaining species-specific information, as its multispectral intensity values resemble optical image data. Image point clouds (IPC) derived from aerial stereo images are another single-sensor option that provides both geometric and optical information. We compared two single-sensor options, M-ALS and IPC, with two LiDAR data sets (leaf-on and leaf-off) with auxiliary OIF, for the prediction of boreal tree species' volumes. In terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) in the validation data, the LiDAR + OIF combination performed best (leaf-on RMSE: 33.3%; leaf-off RMSE 34.3%), followed by M-ALS + OIF (RMSE = 35.2%) and IPC + OIF (RMSE = 42.4%). The mean RMSE value associated with M-ALS increased to the same level (44.7%) as the IPC + OIF combination when optical image features were not included. Both IPC and M-ALS are potential single sensor solutions for forest inventories, but the use of both LiDAR and OIF provides the most accurate results.

AB Multi-angular and multi-temporal methods have been developed and accepted as two promising strategies for reliable soil moisture retrieval from radar data. However, the way to combine time series multi-angular data acquired from both descending and ascending orbits with different imaging modes (e.g., ScanSAR and Stripmap) remains unresolved. Consequently, a multi-temporal algorithm is proposed for soil moisture retrieval at the pixel paddock scale (25-500 m) using time series multi-angular L-band (1.26 GHz) radar data. The method assumes time-invariant roughness and vegetation for the retrieval period together with a soil moisture dry-down constraint for noise reduction, while utilizing multi-angular data without incidence angle normalization. The Numerical Maxwell Model of Three-Dimensional simulations and distorted Born approximation (NMM3D-DBA) were used to build a set of landcover specific multi-angular look up tables(LUTs). Effective isotropic roughness values were assumed suitably able to account for the periodic features in cultivated surfaces, with values determined as part of the soil moisture retrieval. A genetic algorithm was used to minimize the difference between LUTs and time series multi-angular radar observations with the dry-down constraint. Evaluation based on the Fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment dataset (SMAPEx-5) has shown an acceptable overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.070 m(3)/m(3) at the 25-m pixel scale and 0.056 m(3)/m(3) at the paddock (field) scale (similar to 0.1-0.5 km). Further investigations on the effect of polarization combination and time interval of radar data have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method for irregularly collected data with different imaging modes.

AB Satellite monitoring of plant phonology in tundra and grassland ecosystems using conventional vegetation indices (VIs), such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), can be biased by effects of snow. Snow free VIs that take advantage of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) band have been proposed to overcome this problem, viz., the phonology index (PI) and the normalized difference phonology index (NDPI). However, the PI cannot properly capture the presence of sparse vegetation, and the NDPI does not account for the influence of dry vegetation. Here, we propose a novel snow-free VI, designated the normalized difference greenness index (NDGI), that uses reflectance in the green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands. The NDGI is a semi-analytical index based on a linear spectral mixture model and the spectral characteristics of vegetation, snow, soil, and dry grass. Its performance at estimating the start and end of the growing season (SOS and EOS) was evaluated using simulation datasets, time-lapse camera data at tundra sites, and flux tower gross primary production (GPP) data at grassland sites. Simulation results demonstrated that the NDGI can exclude the influence of snow on estimates of SOS and EOS. At the tundra sites, the NDGI markedly outperformed the NDVI, PI, NDPI, NIRv (near-infrared reflectance of vegetation), EVI2 (two-band enhanced vegetation index), PPI (plant phenology index), and DVI (difference vegetation index plus) for SOS estimation, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.5 days and a Bias of 1.3 days, and for EOS estimation, with an RMSE of 8.3 days and a Bias of 0.11 days. At the grassland sites, the NDGI also outperformed the other VIs at SOS estimation, with an RMSE of 10.3 days and a Bias of 4.9 days. Although its performance was poorer at monitoring EOS than SOS at grassland (GPP) sites, its performance was comparable to that of the PI and superior to that of the other VIs at estimating EOS. These results indicate the potential of the NDGI for operational monitoring of plant phenology in tundra and grassland ecosystems based on satellite observations.

AB The Sentinel satellite missions are designed to provide remote-sensing observational capability to many diverse operational applications, including in the field of agriculture and food security. They do this by acquiring frequent observations from a combination of optical, thermal and microwave sensors at various spatial resolutions. However, one currently missing capability, that would enable monitoring of evapotranspiration, crop water stress and water use at field scale, is the lack of high-resolution (tens of meters) thermal sensor. In this study we evaluate a methodology for bridging this data gap by employing a machine learning algorithm to sharpen low resolution thermal observations from the Sentinel-3 satellites using images acquired by high-resolution optical sensors on the Sentinel-2 satellites. The resulting dataset is then used as input to land-surface energy balance model to estimate evapotranspiration. The methodology is tested using Terra and Landsat satellite observations, due to lack of sufficiently long time-series of Sentinel observations, and benchmarked against fluxes derived with high-resolution thermal observations acquired by the Landsat satellites. We then apply the methodology to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 images to confirm its applicability to this type of data. The results show that the fluxes derived with sharpened thermal data are of acceptable accuracy (relative error lower than 20%) and provide more information at flux-tower footprint scale than the corresponding low-resolution fluxes. They also replicate the spatial and temporal patterns of fluxes derived with high-resolution thermal observations. However, the increase in error of the modelled fluxes compared to using high-resolution thermal observations and the inherent limitations of the sharpening approach point to the need to add high-resolution thermal mission to the Sentinels' constellation.

AB Forest ecosystems are subject to recurring fires as one of their most significant disturbances. Accurate mapping of burn severity is crucial for post-fire land management and vegetation regeneration monitoring. Remote-sensing-based monitoring of burn severity faces new challenges when forests experience both fire and non-fire disturbances, which may change the biophysical and biochemical properties of trees in similar ways. In this study, we develop a Disturbance Weighting Analysis Model (DWAM) for accurately mapping burn severity in a forest landscape that is jointly affected by wildfire and an emerging infectious disease - sudden oak death. Our approach treats burn severity in each basic mapping unit (e.g., 30 m grid from a post-fire Landsat image) as a linear combination of burn severity of trees affected (diseased) and not affected by the disease (healthy), weighted by their areal fractions in the unit. DWAM is calibrated using two types of inputs: i) look-up tables (LUTs) linking burn severity and post-fire spectra for diseased and healthy trees, derived from field observations, hyperspectral sensors [e.g., Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)], and radiative transfer models; and ii) pre-fire fractional maps of diseased and healthy trees, derived by decomposing a pre-fire Landsat image using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). Considering the presence of tree disease in DWAM improved the overall map accuracy by 42%. The superior performance is consistent across all three stages of disease progression. Our approach demonstrates the potential for improved mapping of forest burn severity by reducing the confounding effects of other biotic disturbances.

AB Microwave remote sensing, both active or passive, can provide useful information about the freeze/thaw (F/T) state of soil near the surface. Here we apply an edge detection algorithm on time series of indicators derived from measurements of SMAP L-band radiometer and ASCAT C-band scatterometer to detect the freeze/thaw onsets of surface soil. Comparing these results against the onsets derived from in situ measurements in Alaska, we demonstrate that this algorithm is an effective approach to detect onsets of the soil FIT transition. More specifically, our results show that the thawing onsets estimated from the SMAP data occurred 5 to 13 days earlier than the onsets estimated from the in situ measurements, which is likely due to the influence of snowmelt on the radiometer signal. The thawing onsets estimated from the ASCAT data were about 6 days later than the in situ onsets. Our estimated freezing onsets from each microwave remote sensing dataset were close to the in situ onsets (1-5 days). We also compare our estimated onsets with those from the SMAP Level 3 F/T product and the mean biases for thawing and freezing onsets are 1 +/- 2 and 1 +/- 3 days, respectively. Furthermore, we illustrate the complementary nature of the SMAP and ASCAT measurements and the potential for combining these two to differentiate snowmelt from soil thawing events.

AB Water spectral indices can enhance the difference between water bodies and background features. Thus, they have been widely used to extract and map surface water bodies based on multispectral satellite imagery. The urban scene is very heterogeneous since the surface is composed of a vast diversity of man-made objects, often of mixed distribution. Urban surface water mapping faces an extreme overestimation phenomenon because certain types of objects such as shadow, dark roads and some artificial features may return similar values to water bodies after an index computation. This study proposes a noise-prediction strategy to eliminate such misclassified nonwater areas in an automated way. Constrained energy minimization (CEM), a typical sparse target detection algorithm that does not need any background information, is utilized to draw the possible distribution of noise based on prior noise samples. The initial noise samples are automatically extracted by calculating the difference between two water indices widely accepted in urban scenes, namely, the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and the automated water extraction index (AWEI). Recently freely available Sentinel-2 multi spectral satellite imagery, with high spatial resolution (up to 10 m) and high repeated global coverage (every 5 days), was adopted, considering its potential on urban land cover mapping. Compared with the AWEI based approach, the results show that the proposed noise-prediction approach obtained an improved overall accuracy (increased Kappa coefficient by 0.07 on average), dramatically enhanced user accuracy (by 12.47% on average) with reduced noise, and simultaneously slightly decreased producer accuracy (by -1.19% on average). That is, the proposed method possesses an improvement of the misclassification of nonwater bodies to water bodies and a suppression of the missing of water body extraction at the same time. Finally, the comparative results, with the varying water index segmentation thresholds (-0.2 to 0.3) and an automatic Otsu threshold, indicate the robustness to the threshold of the proposed approach.

AB One of the most common approaches to reducing the environmental impact of nitrogen (N) fertilisation in intensive agrosystems is to adjust the N input of the crop requirement. This adjustment is frequently related to the nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) based on the concepts of the critical and actual N absorbed (kg/ha) in the crop canopy (respectively, N-c and CNC). Accurate estimation of the N-c and CNC at the field scale over large areas based on freely available satellite imagery is thus a key issue to address. Relying on a large dataset of farmers' fields, this study highlights the high correlation (R-2 = 0.90) between the wheat CNC and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) retrieved from Sentinel-2 (S2) with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The estimation is related to errors of 4 and 21 kg/ha (depending on the growing stage), which is a promising result for evaluating the NNI. There are four major outcomes from this result: (i) the importance of working at the canopy level; (ii) the independence of the relationship to the considered cultivars; (iii) the dependence of the relationship on the growing stage; and (iv) the potential to use only the 10 m S2 bands, opening the way for precision agriculture. In parallel, estimation accuracies were investigated for the three biophysical variables (BV) related to the CNC and N-c, i.e., the green area index (GAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) and CCC. From this analysis, the added value of the red-edge bands for improving the estimation of the 3 BVs of interest was quantified as was the performance reduction related to the field heterogeneity.

AB Landsat time series (LTS) enable the characterization of forest recovery post-disturbance over large areas; however, there is a gap in our current knowledge concerning the linkage between spectral measures of recovery derived from LTS and actual manifestations of forest structure in regenerating stands. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data provide useful measures of forest structure that can be used to corroborate spectral measures of forest recovery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of a spectral index of recovery based on the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR): the years to recovery, or Y2R metric, as an indicator of the return of forest vegetation following forest harvest (clearcutting). The Y2R metric has previously been defined as the number of years required for a pixel to return to 80% of its pre-disturbance NBR (NBRpre) value. In this study, the Composite2Change (C2C) algorithm was used to generate a time series of gap-free, cloud-free Landsat surface reflectance composites (1985-2012), associated change metrics, and a spatially-explicit dataset of detected changes for an actively managed forest area in southern Finland (5.3 Mha). The overall accuracy of change detection, determined using independent validation data, was 89%. Areas of forest harvesting in 1991 were then used to evaluate the Y2R metric. Four alternative recovery scenarios were evaluated, representing variations in the spectral threshold used to define Y2R: 60%, 80%, and 100% of NBRpre, and a critical value of z (i.e. the year in which the pixel's NBR value is no longer significantly different from NBRpre). The Y2R for each scenario were classified into five groups: recovery within < 10 years, 10-13 years, 14-17 years, > 17 years, and not recovered. Measures of forest structure (canopy height and cover) were obtained from ALS data. Benchmarks for height (> 5 m) and canopy cover ( > 10%) were applied to each recovery scenario, and the percentage of pixels that attained both of these benchmarks for each recovery group, was determined for each Y2R scenario. Our results indicated that the Y2R metric using the 80% threshold provided the most realistic assessment of forest recovery: all pixels considered in our analysis were spectrally recovered within the analysis period, with 88.88% of recovered pixels attaining the benchmarks for both cover and height. Moreover, false positives (pixels that had recovered spectrally, but not structurally) and false negatives (pixels that had recovered structurally, but not spectrally) were minimized with the 80% threshold. This research demonstrates the efficacy of LTS-derived assessments of recovery, which can be spatially exhaustive and retrospective, providing important baseline data for forest monitoring.

AB Snow cover condition across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is not only a significant indicator of climate change but also a vital variable in water availability because of its water storage function in high-mountain regions of Southwest China and the surrounding Asian countries. Limited by low spatial resolution, incomplete spatial coverage, and short time span of the current snow cover products, the long-term snow cover change across the TP under the climate change background remains unclear. To resolve this issue, a composite long-term gap-filled TP daily 5-km snow cover extent (SCE) record (TPSCE) is generated by integrating SCE from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) surface reflectance climate data record (CDR) and several existing snow cover data sets, with the help of a decision tree snow cover mapping algorithm, for the period 1981-2016. A snow discrimination process was used to classify the land surface into snow (pre-TPSCE) and non-snow using AVHRR surface reflectance CDR. To fill gaps caused by invalid observations and cloud contamination in pre-TPSCE, several existing daily SCE products, including MOD10C1, MYD10C1, IMS, JASMES, and a passive microwave snow depth data set are employed in the composition process. The daily snow discrimination accuracy, tested by ground snow-depth observations during 2000-2014, shows that the TPSCE captures the distribution of snow duration days (R-2 = 0.80, bias = 3.93 days) effectively. The comparison between the TPSCE and fineresolution snow cover maps (MCD10A1-TP) indicates high comparability between the TPSCE and MCD10A1-TP. In addition, cross-comparisons with changes in temperature, precipitation, and land surface albedo indicate that the TPSCE is reliable in climate change studies. In summary, the TPSCE is spatially complete and covers the longest period among all current snow cover products from satellite observations. The TPSCE seamlessly records changes in snow cover across the TP over the past 36 years, thereby providing valuable snow information for climate change and hydrological studies.

AB The presence of a forest canopy above highly reflective snow results in overall lower surface albedo, even when snow is intercepted by the forest canopy. The effective forest snow albedo (FSA) explains the overall upwelling radiation from the forest relative to the incoming radiation. FSA is strongly influenced by the complex pathways of radiation as it travels through the 3D canopy structure. Current errors in calculations of FSA arise due to uncertainties in how models should treat masking of snow by vegetation. Improvement of distributed models is currently limited by a lack of measurements that demonstrate both spatial and temporal variability over forests. We present above-canopy measurements of winter-time effective forest snow albedo using up- and down-looking radiometers mounted on an octocopter UAV for a total of fifteen flights on eight different days. Ground-view fractions across the flight path were between 0.12 and 0.81. Correlations between FSA and both ground-view fraction and maximum canopy height were statistically significant during 14 out of 15 flights, but correlation strength varied between flights as a function of solar angle and snow cover. Measured effective albedo across the flight path differed by up to 0.33 during snow-on canopy conditions. A subsequent comparison between maximum interception and no interception showed effective albedo differed by up 0.27. A similar variation (0.26) in effective FSA was measured during low (44) and high (67) solar zenith angles. This study therefore demonstrates that temporal and spatial variations in effective albedo caused by canopy shading of the snow surface are therefore as important as temporal variations caused by interception of snow by the canopy. Calculation of effective albedo of forested areas requires careful consideration of canopy height, canopy coverage, solar angle and interception coverage. The results of this study should be used to inform snow albedo and canopy structure parametrizations in local and larger scale land surface models.

AB Land degradation (LD) is one of the most catastrophic outcomes of long-lasting drought events and anthropogenic activities. Assessing climate and human-induced impacts on land can provide information for decision makers to mitigate the effects of these phenomena. The Northeastern region of Brazil (NEB) is the most populous dryland on the planet, making it a highly vulnerable ecosystem especially when considering the lingering drought that started in 2012. The present work consisted of detecting trends in biomass [leaf area index (LAI)] anomalies as indicators of LD in NEB. We also assessed how the loss of vegetation impacts the LD cycle, by measuring trends in albedo and evapotranspiration (ET). LAI, albedo and ET data were derived from MODIS sensors at 8-day temporal and 500 m spatial resolutions. For precipitation anomalies, we relied on CHIRPS-v2 10-day temporal at 5 km spatial resolution data. For detecting trends, we applied the Theil-Sen slope analysis on time series of MODIS LAI, albedo and ET images. Trend analysis was performed for the periods ranging from 2002-2012 (no severe droughts) to 2002-2016 (including the last drought). LAI trends were more pronounced and had a stronger signal than ET and albedo, therefore, LAI was our choice for mapping LD. The first analysis highlighted the human-induced LD prone areas whereas the last detected drought-induced LD prone areas. Considering only the trending areas, which was about 23.4% of the total, 4.5% of this area has undergone human-induced degradation whereas drought was responsible for 73%, although, not mutually exclusive. As reported in the literature and official data, grazing intensification might be a factor driving human-induced degradation. We noticed that the range of variation of LAI is narrow and even narrower for albedo, which demonstrates that land surface response is more influenced by soil reflectivity rather than the characteristic sparse vegetation coverage (LAI ranging from 0.04 to 0.4 in the Caatinga biome), which can barely alter albedo. Finally, the effects of LD on ET anomalies were assessed by Granger causality and impulse-response analyses as means to link land surface feature changes to the hydrological cycle. Albedo had a slightly weaker impulse than LAI on ET whereas precipitation played a major role. These relations are site-specific and, land surface features (biomass and albedo) showed to have a more substantial influence on ET in severely degraded areas. We concluded that drought led to trends indicating LD prone areas in NEB and the degradation cycle has positive feedback derived from ET reduction resulting in an increased net moisture deficit, although the latter statement has yet to be further investigated. The study warns of the desertification risk that NEB is facing and the need for the authorities to take action to mitigate degradation and drought effects on both traditionally surveyed (desertification nuclei) and newfound LD prone areas. We also highlight the limitation of confirming LD, as to date there is no post-drought data available and, lessons learned from the Sahel case make us cautious about claiming that an area is in fact degraded.

AB The NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission was launched on January 31st, 2015. The spacecraft was to provide high-resolution (3 km and 9 km) global soil moisture estimates at regular intervals by combining for the first time L-band radiometer and radar observations. On July 7th, 2015, a component of the SMAP radar failed and the radar ceased operation. However, before this occurred the mission was able to collect and process similar to 2.5 months of the SMAP high-resolution active-passive soil moisture data (L2SMAP) that coincided with the Northern Hemisphere's vegetation green-up and crop growth season. In this study, we evaluate the SMAP high resolution soil moisture product derived from several alternative algorithms against in situ data from core calibration and validation sites (CVS), and sparse networks. The baseline algorithm had the best comparison statistics against the CVS and sparse networks. The overall unbiased root-mean-square-difference is close to the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) the SMAP mission requirement. A 3 km spatial resolution soil moisture product was also examined. This product had an unbiased root-mean-square-difference of similar to 0.053 m(3)/m(3). The SMAP L2SMAP product for similar to 2.5 months is now validated for use in geophysical applications and research and available to the public through the NASA Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). The L2SMAP product is packaged with the geo-coordinates, acquisition times, and all requisite ancillary information. Although limited in duration, SMAP has clearly demonstrated the potential of using a combined L-band radar-radiometer for proving high spatial resolution and accurate global soil moisture.

AB Harmful algal blooms (HABs) present a potential danger for human health and commercial activities, especially in coastal regions. Observing systems increasingly rely on remote sensors to monitor and possibly predict the locations and intensity of such blooms. Here we present a novel approach for detecting HABs of Alexandrium fundyense in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. A. fundyense is considered toxic for individuals who consume shellfish when cell abundances adjacent to shellfish harvesting areas are as low as 200 cells.L-1, making it difficult to use direct remote sensing techniques to assess the threat in the early stages of the development of the bloom. Using in situ A. fundyense cell abundance measurements, together with satellite observations of sea-surface temperature and the occurrence of diatom-dominated phytoplankton populations, a warning system was developed based on three levels of alerts: green (low abundance of A. fundyense), orange (possible threat of A. fundyense) and red (high probability of A. fundyense concentrations that would result in shellfish toxicity above safe levels for human consumption). Combined information on diatom phenology and variations in sea-surface temperature are key to the timing of A. fundyense blooms: our data reveal that the termination of the diatom spring bloom, associated with the warming of the water, can trigger an increase in A. fundyense cell abundance. The objective criteria for a HAB warning system was developed and tested in the Bay of Fundy using two different datasets: one to develop the algorithm (data collected between 1998 and 2007) and one to assess its performance (data collected in 2011). The warning system is based on the cautionary principle that a false negative (warning not issued when it should have been) is far more serious than a false positive (warning issued when it should not have been). The overall success of the algorithm when tested on the validation dataset is about 70% using a threshold of 150 A. fundyense cells.L-1, with a low occurrence of false negative red alerts (< 8%). The satellite data -based warning can be used to optimize an in situ monitoring system, which can be designed to be more intensive when the warning status is orange or red. This study demonstrates that combined satellite information on phytoplankton phonology and sea-surface temperature can help predict low abundances of toxic A. fundyense cells. It also highlights the importance of an integrated approach combining satellite and in situ observations to monitor HABs.

AB The Northern and Southern Patagonian Ice Fields (NPI and SPI) in South America are the largest bodies of ice in the Southern hemisphere outside of Antarctica and the largest contributors to eustatic sea level rise (SLR) in the world, per unit area. Here we exploit swath processed CryoSat-2 interferometric data to produce maps of surface elevation change at sub-kilometer spatial resolution over the Ice Fields for six glaciological years between April 2011 and March 2017. Mass balance is calculated independently for nine sub-regions, including six individual glaciers larger than 300 km2. Overall, between 2011 and 2017 the Patagonian Ice Fields have lost mass at a combined rate of 21.29 +/- 1.98 Gt a(-1) contributing 0.059 +/- 0.005 rum a(-1) to SLR. We observe widespread thinning on the Ice Fields, particularly north of 49 degrees S. However the pattern of surface elevation change is highly heterogeneous, partly reflecting the importance of dynamic processes on the Ice Fields. The Jorge Montt glacier (SPI), whose tidewater terminus is approaching floatation, retreated similar to 2.5 km during our study period and lost mass at the rate of 2.20 +/- 0.38 Gt a(-1) (4.64 +/- 0.80 m(we) a(-1)). In contrast with the general pattern of retreat and mass loss, Pio XI, the largest glacier in South America, is advancing and gaining mass at 0.67 +/- 0.29 Gt a(-1) rate.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) values retrieved from satellite measurements in the thermal infrared (TIR) may be strongly affected by spatial anisotropy. Different parametric approaches have been proposed to simulate such effects. These are relatively simple models requiring few input data and therefore appropriate to simulate directional effects in satellite LST retrievals over large areas. The purpose of this study is to consistently evaluate the performance of two parametric models (the so-called Kernel and Hotspot models), and to assess their respective potential to correct directional effects on LST for a wide range of surface conditions, in terms of tree coverage, vegetation density, surface emissivity. We also propose an optimization of the correction of directional effects through a synergistic use of both models. The Kernel model allows an effective simulation of LST directionality associated with shadowing effects and emissivity anisotropy, but results show that it significantly underestimates the amplitude of the angular corrections. The Hotspot model performs better in simulating anisotropy related to shadowing effects. However, it is unable to account for emissivity anisotropy, showing lower performance than the Kernel model for nighttime data and for low tree coverage. The combined Kernel-Hotspot model provides corrections on LST directionality with reliable quality, with particularly improved performance during nighttime and for low tree densities.

AB As high-latitudes warm, permafrost thaws, and the hydrological cycle accelerates, ground-based monitoring of riverine organic matter may be supplemented by satellite remote sensing during ice-free conditions. Recent programs, namely the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory, have established methodologically consistent sampling across the hydrograph, and shared the resulting data publicly. However, these efforts are limited by frequency, funding, and length of record. Satellite remote sensing can be used to estimate chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) as a riverine constituent that influences optical properties in surface waters. In this study, daily CDOM absorption was first estimated using discharge-constituent regression-based models for 2000-2013. We then regressed these discharge-based CDOM estimates against Landsat TM and ETM + surface reflectance data from Google Earth Engine for the six largest rivers draining the pan-Arctic watershed (the Kolyma, Lena, Mackenzie, Ob', Yenisey, and Yukon rivers). These CDOM results were converted to dissolved organic carbon (DOC), using the strong relationship (R-2 = 0.88) between direct measurements of the two constituents. Using river-specific remote sensing models, R-2 could be as high as 0.84. Grouping all rivers into a single "universal" regression reduced R-2 and increased root mean square errors, such as in the Yenisey River where R-2 dropped by 0.63, and RMSE rose by 1.1 m(-1). Seasonally varying discharge drove much of the variation in satellite-derived CDOM and DOC, corroborating recent studies. Satellite imagery can increase the frequency of monitoring observations, particularly during summer and fall when riverine CDOM absorption may be most sensitive to thawing permafrost.

AB In this study, a vector radiative transfer model for the coupled ocean-atmosphere system with consideration of the effects of Earth curvature (named PCOART-SA) was developed using the pseudo-spherical approximation. Both downward and reflected solar beam radiation were corrected accounting for Earth curvature effects. Validation showed that the PCOART-SA results agreed well with literature benchmarks and the CDISORT and AccuRT model results. Based on PCOART-SA, Earth curvature effects on Rayleigh-scattering radiance including polarization were investigated. The results showed that the influence of Earth curvature increased rapidly with solar zenith angle, with influences up to 1%, 3%, and 12% for solar zenith angles at 75, 80, and 85, respectively, which should be considered for high accuracy atmospheric correction. We also found that the Rayleigh-scattering look-up table in SeaDAS after version 7.2 showed significant bias at high solar zenith angles, which needs further investigation. Finally, using the PCOART-SA model, we generated Rayleigh-scattering lookup tables for Aqua/MODIS with consideration of Earth curvature effects, which can be directly used in SeaDAS.

AB All values of soil adjustment factor (L) from 0 to 1 in the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) were found to be undesirable in arid areas with sparse vegetation cover. We hypothesized that the negative soil adjustment factor in the SAVI would be satisfactory in arid areas. In the study, we explored the potential of negative soil adjustment factor in the SAVI against a set of field measurements during the growing season of 2009 in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. As hypothesized, negative soil adjustment factor was found to give satisfactory reduction of soil background noise. SAVI (L = -0.2) (R-2 = 0.64, RMSE = 18.4 g m(-2), rRMSE = 25.5%, n = 120) provided dramatic improvements over optimal NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) (that is, SAVI (L = 0)) (R-2 = 0.44, RMSE = 22.7 g m(-2), rRMSE = 31.4%, n = 120) for aboveground living biomass (AGB) estimation among tested vegetation indices. A physical basis for the negative soil adjustment factor was also explored. Results showed that, the intersected points between approximate vegetation isolines and soil line were situated in the domain of positive values of NIR (near-infrared) and red in the first quadrant of NIR-red plane, and the slopes of vegetation isolines increased with increasing AGB in the desert steppe, thus resulting in negative factor by shifting the origin toward positive intersected points. This runs counter to reported vegetation isolines behavior for SAVI, in which the intersected points were situated in the region of negative values of NIR and red in the third quadrant. The good performance of negative factor was also observed for percent green cover (PGC) estimation in the desert steppe. We further proposed a conceptual model to describe vegetation isolines behavior in arid grasslands. Our findings will complement widely used soil adjustment factor. Further study is needed to validate the negative soil factor and test the conceptual model in other arid grasslands.

AB Remote measurements of land surface temperature are prone to significant directional anisotropy. This anisotropy is strong over urban surfaces because of three-dimensional structures and the resulting heterogeneous temperature distributions. However, the development of models that correct urban thermal anisotropy and consider the two factors is rare. In this study, with the assumption of random building orientations, we developed a Geometric model to simulate Thermal Anisotropy over a sparse Urban surface (GUTA-sparse), which does not consider the mutual shadowing effect. GUTA-sparse assumes that anisotropy is the sum of three parts: the vertical wall background temperature contribution, vertical wall orientation effects and shadow contribution. The simulation data provided by the 3-D Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model and airborne measurements over the city of Marseille were employed to evaluate model performance. The results show that in this model, the solar zenith angle influences the ability of the fitted coefficients to characterize surface features. GUTA-sparse is applicable over urban surfaces that have aspect ratios smaller than 1.0, where the mutual shadowing effect is negligible. The proposed model can also well simulate the airborne measured anisotropy with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.44, 0.44, 0.56 and 0.40 K, and the anisotropy amplitudes at the four flight times all exceed 8 K. The model is independent of surface parameters that are difficult to obtain, which makes it suitable for remote sensing applications. Because the model is linear with respect to surface parameters, it can be applied to heterogeneous urban surfaces. This model aids in better understanding the relationships among urban surface geometry, component temperatures and thermal anisotropy, and this model may potentially correct the directional temperature values to a common viewing geometry.

AB Measurements of vegetation structure have become a valuable tool for ecological research and environmental management. However, data describing the thermal 3D structure of canopies and how they vary both spatially and temporally remain sparse. Coincident RGB and thermal imagery from a UAV platform were collected of both a standalone tree and a relatively dense forest stand in the sub-alpine Eastern Swiss Alps. For the first time, SfM-MVS methods were used to develop 3D RGB and thermal point clouds of the two sites with point densities of 35,245 and 776 points per m(2), respectively, compared to 78 points per m(2) for an airborne LiDAR dataset of the same area. Despite the low resolution of the thermal imagery compared to RGB photosets, forest structural elements were accurately resolved in both point clouds. Improvements in the quality of the thermal 3D data were gained through the application of a distance filter based on the proximity of these data to the RGB 3D point data. Vertical temperature gradients of trees were negative with increasing height at the standalone tree, but were positive in the dense stand largely due to increased self-shading of incoming shortwave energy. Repeat surveys across a single morning during the snowmelt period revealed changes in the spatial distribution of canopy temperatures which are consistent with canopy warming from direct solar radiation. This is the first time that coincidentally acquired RGB and thermal imagery have been combined to generate separate RGB and thermal point clouds of 3D structures. These methods and findings demonstrate important implications for atmospheric, hydrological and ecological modeling, and have wide application for effective thermal measurements of remote environmental landscapes.

AB Simulated signals from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), reflected off the sea surface and received aboard low Earth orbiting satellites, have been used to derive sea surface height (SSH) and assimilated into an ocean model in an Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE). The experimental approach is named GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R), which was proposed for the International Space Station (ISS). This scientific experiment was conducted in the frame of the ESA mission called "GNSS REflectometry, Radio Occultation and Scatterometry aboard the International Space Station" (GEROS-ISS). In this study, three sources of uncertainties of the planned GNSS-R altimeter are considered by the GNSS-R simulator: the troposphere, the ionosphere, and a noise term. An ensemble optimal interpolation (EnOI) data assimilation system is set up for an eddy-resolving HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) of the South China Sea (SCS), and two data assimilation runs are performed from the 18th June to the 31st July 2014 with and without GNSS-R. In the run assimilating GNSS-R, the measurements come in addition to traditional Sea Level Anomalies (SLA) from present-day altimeters. In spite of the lower precision of individual GNSS-R retrievals, the results obtained in July show an overall improvement of the Root Mean Squared Difference (RMSD) by 14%, compared to traditional altimeter data only. Considering the crossing of Typhoon Rammasun through the SCS, the GNSS-R data improve the realism of the three largest eddies. The temperature sections along the typhoon track show large differences in the upper 200 m depths in excess of 1 degrees C near the shelf break. Finally, diagnostics of Degree of Freedom for Signal (DFS) provide a quantitative Impact Factor (IF) of the GNSS-R altimetry data over the conventional altimeter data. On average in July, the IF is low (< 5%), but for the period of the typhoon it reaches values over 20%. This indicates the complementary of the GNSS-R altimetry data to the present observing system, especially in filling the gaps of the traditional altimeters.

AB Spatial and temporal satellite image fusion (STIF) has provided a feasible alternative for generating imagery with both high spatial and temporal resolution, thus expanding the applications of existing satellite sensors. However, a critical challenge confronting the further development of STIF is to systematically and robustly address complex land surface changes, which include land cover changes without shape changes (e.g., crop rotation) and land cover changes with shape changes (e.g., urban expansion), in addition to conventional land surface changes (e.g., phenological changes of vegetation). This paper presents the Robust Adaptive Spatial and Temporal Fusion Model (RASTFM) to tackle this challenge with one prior pair of MODIS-Landsat images. In RASTFM, land surface changes are reorganized into non-shape changes (including phenological changes and land cover changes without shape changes) and shape changes (i.e., land cover changes with shape changes), which are handled differently. However, both non-shape changes and shape changes are predicted through a Non-Local Linear Regression (NL-LR) of the subject pixel's similar neighbors. A regression.based high-pass modulation is also performed as a post-processing step to improve both the spatial details and spectral fidelity of the predicted Landsat image. Unlike other STIF models (e.g., the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model, STARFM), RASTFM can find similar neighboring pixels more precisely through a non-local searching strategy and derives the weights of similar neighbors more rigorously via a linear regression model. As both non-shape and shape changes are treated based on the regression of similar neighboring pixels, the land surface changes are processed in a unified manner. Experiments that use one simulated and three actual MODIS-Landsat datasets featured by different types of land surface changes were conducted to demonstrate the performance of RASTFM. Comparisons with the state-of-the-art STIF models, including weighted function, unmixing and dictionary learning methods, show that NL-LR based RASTFM can capture the land surface changes in various landscapes more accurately and robustly in a unified manner, thereby facilitating the continuous and detailed monitoring of complex and diverse land surface dynamics.

AB Multispectral imagery is a widely used source of information to address post-fire ecosystem management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of remotely sensed indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS to assess initial bum severity (overall, on vegetation and on soil) in fire-prone pine forests along the Mediterranean Transition-Oceanic climatic gradient in the Mediterranean Basin. We selected four large wildfires which affected pine forests in a climatic gradient within the Iberian Peninsula. In each wildfire we established CBI plots to obtain field values of three bum severity metrics: site, vegetation and soil burn severity. The ability of 13 spectral indices to match these three field burn severity metrics was compared and their transferability along the climatic gradient assessed using linear regression models. Specifically, we analysed the performance of 12 indices previously used for bum severity assessments (8 reflective, 2 thermal, 2 mixed) and a new reflective index (dNBR-EVI). The results showed that Landsat spectral indices have a greater ability to determine site and vegetation bum severity than soil burn severity. We found large differences in indices performances among the three different climatic regions, since most indices performed better in the Mediterranean and Transition regions than in the Oceanic one. In general, the dNBR-EVI showed the best fit to site, vegetation and soil bum severity in the three regions, demonstrating broad transferability along the entire climatic gradient.

AB The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission provides time-variable gravity fields that are commonly used to study regional and global terrestrial total water storage (TWS) changes. These estimates are superimposed by different error sources such as the north south stripes in the spatial domain and spectral/spatial leakage errors, which should be reduced before use in hydrological applications. Although different filtering methods have been developed to mitigate these errors, their performances are known to vary between regions. In this study, a Kernel Fourier Integration (KeFIn) filter is proposed, which can significantly decrease leakage errors over (small) river basins through a two-step post-processing algorithm. The first step mitigates the measurement noise and the aliasing of unmodelled high-frequency mass variations, and the second step contains an efficient kernel to decrease the leakage errors. To evaluate its performance, the KeFIn filter is compared with commonly used filters based on (i) basin/gridded scaling factors and (ii) ordinary basin averaging kernels. Two test scenarios are considered-that include synthetic data with properties similar to GRACE TWS estimates within 43 globally distributed river basins of various sizes and application of the filters on real GRACE data. The KeFIn filter is assessed against water flux observations through the water balance equations as well as in-situ measurements. Results of both tests indicate a remarkable improvement after applying the KeFIn filter with leakage errors reduced in 34 out of the 43 assessed river basins and an average improvement of about 23.38% in leakage error reduction compared to other filters applied in this study.

AB The three-component model of Brewin et al. (2010) computes fractional contributions of three phytoplankton size classes (micro- (> 20 mu m), nano- (2-20 mu m), picophytoplankton (< 2 mu m)) to the overall chlorophyll a concentration (Chla). Using in situ pigment data, model coefficients were adjusted for application to the southern African marine region. The refined model was applied to seasonal and monthly climatologies of MODIS Aqua Chla around Southern Africa. Chla > 1 mg m(-3) was limited to shelf regions along the coasts of Southern Africa and Madagascar, while values < 0.1 mg(-3) were found over most of the open ocean between the equator and 38 S during austral summer and autumn. In winter and spring, low values (< 0.1 mg m(-3)) were restricted to smaller regions within subtropical gyres, while values up to 0.7 mg m(-3) extended over a much greater area of the open ocean. Shelf regions in the northern (NB) and southern Benguela (SB), Agulhas Bank (AB), Agulhas region (AR), and Mozambique Channel (MC) all showed similar seasonal cycles of size structure. On average, microphytoplankton comprised > 50% of the total Chia in these regions with little change throughout the year. The AR shelf differed, with picophytoplankton dominating in summer, and micro- and nanophytoplankton the rest of the year. In the open ocean domains of the NB, SB, and AB regions, nanophytoplankton dominated for most of the year, with picophytoplankton being more prevalent during summer and autumn. In contrast, in the AR open ocean, nanophytoplankton were dominant only during winter and early spring, whereas picophytoplankton dominated throughout the year in the MC open ocean. The refined model characterised previously unknown spatial and temporal changes in size structure in various ecosystems around Southern Africa.

AB Carbon-based fuels burned at industrial facilities account for a large proportion of greenhouse gas emissions, and an up-to-date spatiotemporally detailed inventory is essential for a better understanding of global carbon emission patterns. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product offers a quantitative estimation of the temperatures of sub-pixel heat sources, providing the potential for detecting thermal anomalies from industrial sectors across the globe. However, identifying subcategories of various industrial heat sources is challenging because there are scarcely any stable and typical characteristics for their classification at a single thermal anomaly scale. Specifically, these nighttime thermal anomalies exhibit a strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity (e.g., fluctuations in retrieved temperature, spatial shifts in position, and presence of false positives), even in industrial heat sources that do not vary through time. Here, we demonstrate an object-oriented approach to robustly segment and accurately classify various industrial heat sources from a time-series of the VIIRS Nightfire product. The approach operates from the cluster level of spatially adjacent nighttime thermal anomalies (i.e., nighttime-heat-source objects rather than individual thermal anomalies) to generate fingerprint like characteristics and to address the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Specifically, the spatial-aggregation characteristic of nighttime thermal anomalies from continuously operating industrial heat sources and the temporal-aggregation characteristics of biomass burnings were incorporated to differentiate industrial nighttime-heat-source objects from ubiquitous biomass burnings. Subsequently, the similarity of the thermal signals of nighttime thermal anomalies from identical industrial heat sources was used to generate highly recognizable characteristics for their identification. A spatiotemporally detailed inventory of industrial heat sources across the globe was then established from this object-oriented classification. The inventory included a total of 15,199 industrial heat sources, representing 49.52% of all higher confidence nighttime thermal anomalies in the VIIRS Nightfire product. Validation of the results showed that only 218 objects (1.43%) were biomass burnings or active volcanoes that were misclassified as industrial heat sources. Further validation of sub-categories indicated an overall classification accuracy of 77%. Our findings suggest that the VIIRS Nightfire product has great potential for monitoring the global distribution and dynamics of industrial heat sources, and combined with the object-oriented approach developed here the methodology is simple, robust, and cost-effective.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are the two most important greenhouse gases emitted by mankind. Better knowledge of the surface sources and sinks of these Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) and related carbon uptake and release processes is needed for important climate change related applications such as improved climate modelling and prediction. Some satellites provide near-surface-sensitive atmospheric CO2 and CH4 observations that can be used to obtain information on CQ(2) and CH4 surface fluxes. The goal of the GHG-CCI project of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) is to use satellite data to generate atmospheric CO2 and CH4 data products meeting demanding GCOS (Global Climate Observing System) greenhouse gas (GHG) ECV requirements. To achieve this, retrieval algorithms are regularly being improved followed by annual data reprocessing and analysis cycles to generate better products in terms of extended time series and continuously improved data quality. Here we present an overview about the latest GHG-CCI data set called Climate Research Data Package No.3 (CRDP3) focusing on the GHG-CCI core data products, which are column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 and CH4, i.e., XCO2 and XCH4, as retrieved from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and TANSO/GOSAT satellite radiances covering the time period end of 2002 to end of 2014. We present global maps and time series including initial validation results obtained by comparisons with Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) ground-based observations. We show that the GCOS requirements for systematic error (<1 ppm for XCO2, <10 ppb for XCH4) and long-term stability (<0.2 ppm/year for XCO2, <2 ppb/year for XCH4) are met for nearly all products (an exception is SCIAMACHY methane especially since 2010). For XCO2 we present comparisons with global models using the output of two CO2 assimilation systems (MACC version 14r2 and CarbonTracker version CT2013B). We show that overall there is reasonable consistency and agreement between all data sets (within-1-2 ppm) but we also found significant differences depending on region and time period.

AB Phytoplankton, the dominant marine primary producers, are considered to be highly sensitive indicators of ecosystem condition and change. The southwest area off the Iberian Peninsula (SWIP, NE Atlantic) is located in a biogeographical transition zone between temperate and subtropical waters, and classified as being very vulnerable to climate change. SWIP includes a variety of oceanic and coastal domains, under the influence of topographic irregularities, coastal upwelling and continental freshwater outflows, that collectively challenge the understanding of phytoplankton dynamics and controls. This study aimed to evaluate patterns in seasonal and interannual variability in phytoplankton and underlying environmental determinants within specific regions of SWIP, during a 15-year period (1997-2012), and to assess whether climate variability affects the regions in different ways. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of satellite-retrieved sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), acquired from the Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI), 4-Icm, 16-day resolution, was used to regionalize the study area. Region-specific Chl-a variability patterns and their linkages with environmental determinants were explored using Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMM). A set of local physical-chemical variables, derived from satellite and model data, and large-scale climate indices, were used as environmental variables. EOF analysis of Chl-a variability over the heterogeneous SWIP area identified nine coherent regions, with distinctive variability patterns (4 coastals, 2 slopes and 3 open-ocean regions). Region specific GAMM models explained between 32% and 82% of Chl-a variance, with higher explanatory power (>61%) for open ocean regions and coastal regions under increased riverine influence. Chl-a model predictors, as well as their effects, varied markedly among SWIP regions. However, climate-sensitive local environmental variables (sea surface temperature SST and photosynthetically available radiation) emerged as the most influential general predictors overall, and large-scale climate indices showed significant but minor effects. Over oceanic SWIP regions, Chl-a (0.08-1.50 pg L-1) showed a uni-modal annual cycle, with increases during the mixed layer deepening and late-winter maxima, reflecting seasonal changes in SST and ocean stratification, and probably related to increased nutrient availability and/or decreased mortality. Over coastal regions south of 37 N, Chl-a (0.23-10 pg L-1) also benefited from riverine discharges, mostly during winter, and upwelling induced by zonal westerly winds, stronger during summer. Over the Portuguese west coast region, Chl-a (0.26-2.20 pg L-1) showed a uni-modal annual cycle, with summer maxima, associated with the stimulatory effects of meridional northerly winds and coastal upwelling that partially extended into slope waters. Chl-a interannual variability showed zonal differences within SWIP, with significant interannual patterns only for regions south of 37 N. Nonetheless, contrasting trends were detected in coastal (decline) and oceanic (increase) regions, possibly a consequence of between-region differences in the relative roles of nutrient and light limitation, corresponding to significant interannual increases in wind speed and mixed layer depth. Our study used a biologically-relevant objective regionalization of a heterogeneous area, to elucidate phytoplankton dynamics and controls.
   The region -specific associations observed between phytoplankton and multiple climate-sensitive environmental drivers over the SWIP area reinforce the role of phytoplankton as a strategic element for evaluating ecosystem responses to climate variability and change.

AB Swell dissipation can influence air-sea interactions and is an error source in numerical models. Remote sensors, including altimeters and synthetic aperture radars, were employed to estimate swell dissipation rates in previous studies. A detailed error analysis is conducted here to better understand the results of these studies. With the help of a numerical model, we find that the point source model cannot separate swell dissipation from frequency dispersion and angular spreading effectively. Monte Carlo simulations of remotely sensing an ideal swell packet show that the accuracy of the estimated dissipation rate depends on the number, the span, and the wave height error of the observations on the swell track. The results also demonstrate that the dependence between estimated dissipation rates and wave steepness is an inherent relation from the fitting process which cannot prove that the boundary-layer turbulence is the leading reason for swell dissipation. Both the point source and the measurement errors of wave heights cause large errors of estimated dissipation rates. Comparing the overall error with the estimated dissipation rates, this study shows that the present swell tracking scheme using satellite data is sufficient to estimate a mean dissipation rate statistically through many swell tracks but is insufficient for case studies of swell dissipation. Besides, a buffer analysis shows that islands might cause more potential errors in many swell tracks used in previous studies, and ideal locations for future experiments are also identified. More advanced techniques are required for a better understanding of swell dissipation.

AB The mechanistic model reported in Lee et al. (2015) estimating the Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) was applied to an oligo- to mesotrophic reservoir in Brazil. The model was originally validated with data covering lake, oceanic, and coastal waters; however, the model used the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) designed for optically deep waters as input and was applied to oceanic and coastal waters to derive absorption [a] and backscattering [b(b)] coefficients. The hypothesis is that the use of QAA(v5) (http://www.ioccg.org/groups/Software_OCA/QAA_v5.pdf) to estimate both a and b(b) (step M1) to retrieve K-d (step M2) and Z(SD) (step M3) will lead to errors caused by M1 preventing an accurate estimate in oligo- to mesotrophic water. To test this hypothesis, data collected in three field trips were used to apply the mechanistic model based on the spectral bands from OLI/Landsat-8, (often applied to oceanic and coastal waters), and multispectral instrument (MSI)/Sentinel-2 bands (applied to QAA designed for very turbid inland water). The impact of step M1 over steps M2 and M3 was analyzed by the error analysis. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for K-d using QAA(v5) ranged between 1035% and 19.76%, while the error using QAA(M14) varied between 12.68% and 28.29%. Regarding the errors of step M3 and applying QAA 5, the total root-mean-square difference (RMSD) varied from 055 to 1.18 m and MAPE ranged between 12.86% and 31.17%, while the RMSD ranged between 0.70 and 1.50 m and MAPE varied from 1433% to 39.13% when using QAA(M14). However, the result from QAA(v5) showed a better correlation with in situ data, although underestimating K-d and Z(SD). Therefore, a modified version of QAA(v5) (QAA(R17)) was evaluated. The results showed an improvement of K-d (MAPE ranging between 8.89% to 18.76%) and Z(SD) (RMSD ranging between 032 and 0.90 m and MAPE ranging between 8.65 and 19.75%), bringing the values close to the 1:1 line. The largest error was observed for the data of the second field trip, where the bio-optical properties showed a horizontal gradient along the reservoir. In addition, the magnitude of the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) also varied depending on the water quality. Thus, with respect to Z(SD) mapping, this research showed that environments with a high variability in R-rs can limit the accurate estimation of inherent optical properties (IOPs) based on QAA(v5). Therefore, the limiting step of the model was attributed to M1, which means that the mechanistic model from Lee et al. (2015) can be considered an universal approach if M1 is modified based on the type of water. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Tropical forests are a key component of the global carbon cycle, and mapping their carbon density is essential for understanding human influences on climate and for ecosystem-service-based payments for forest protection. Discrete-return airborne laser scanning (ALS) is increasingly recognised as a high-quality technology for mapping tropical forest carbon, because it generates 3D point clouds of forest structure from which aboveground carbon density (ACD) can be estimated. Area-based models are state of the art when it comes to estimating ACD from ALS data, but discard tree-level information contained within the ALS point cloud. This paper compares area based and tree-centric models for estimating ACD in lowland old-growth forests in Sabah, Malaysia. These forests are challenging to map because of their immense height. We compare the performance of (a) an area-based model developed by Asner and Mascaro (2014), and used primarily in the neotropics hitherto, with (b) a tree-centric approach that uses a new algorithm (itcSegment) to locate trees within the ALS canopy height model, measures their heights and crown widths, and calculates biomass from these dimensions. We find that Asner and Mascaro's model needed regional calibration, reflecting the distinctive structure of Southeast Asian forests. We also discover that forest basal area is closely related to canopy gap fraction measured by ALS, and use this finding to refine Asner and Mascaro's model. Finally, we show that our tree-centric approach is less accurate at estimating ACD than the best-performing area-based model (RMSE 18% vs 13%). Tree-centric modelling is appealing because it is based on summing the biomass of individual trees, but until algorithms can detect understory trees reliably and estimate biomass from crown dimensions precisely, areas-based modelling will remain the method of choice.

AB One of the biodiversity metrics to track from space is the spatial variability in reflectance that has previously been proposed as a proxy of species counts per unit area. The corresponding hypothesis is known as the spectral variability hypothesis (SVH). Little attention has been paid so far to the questions whether the SVH holds over broader regions and across time. Here, we addressed these questions by using a spatially contiguous dataset of vascular plant species occurrences in Southern Germany along with MODIS data at 14 time steps. The floristic dataset consists of species occurrence data for 815 areas of 10 longitudinal by 6 latitudinal minutes (approximately 12 km by 11 km, referred to as mapping units). The spectral variability in space (within these units) was determined using MODIS pixels of 0.5 km by 0.5 km. We used two different measures of spectral variability in combination with a moving window approach to derive statistical links between spectral variability and species counts through space and time. The moving windows consisting of several mapping units were shifted in space and meanwhile used as target areas for correlation analyses.
   The performance of the spectral variability to predict species counts was influenced by the location and the extent of the reference windows. In some regions, high spectral variability was connected to high species counts. In other regions, comparably low spectral variability was linked to high species counts and vice versa. Furthermore, the relation between spectral variability and species varied with season. Certain areas changed from almost no correlation to very high correlation depending on the applied scene. Also, the applied spectral variability measure had a notable influence on the observed results.
   Based on these results, we conclude that the spectral variability hypothesis does not hold across landscapes at this spatial grain. Using spectral variability alone as a proxy for species counts in a monitoring approach for larger extents and grains is therefore unlikely to work in many parts of the world. This does not mean that it cannot help as a covariate in analyses with more predictors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The near-shore surface mesoscale atmospheric circulation in the upwelling systems off Peru and Chile is influential on the Sea Surface Temperature through Ekman transport and pumping. There has been a debate whether or not the so-called "wind drop-off", that is a shoreward decrease of the surface wind speed near the coast, can act as an effective forcing of upwelling through Ekman pumping. Although the wind drop-off has been simulated by high-resolution atmospheric models, it has not been well documented due to uncertainties in the scatterometry-derived wind estimates associated with land contamination. Here we use the along-track altimetry-derived surface wind speed data from ENVISAT, Jason-1, Jason-2, and SARAL satellites, to document the spatial variability of the mean wind drop-off near the coast as estimated from the inversion of the radar backscattering coefficient. The data are first calibrated so as to fit with the scatterometer observations of previous and current satellite missions (QuikSCAT, ASCAT). The calibrated data are then analyzed near the coast and a wind drop-off scale is estimated. The results indicate that the wind drop-off takes place all along the coast, though with a significant alongshore variability in its magnitude. Differences between products are shown to be related both to the differences in repeat cycle between the different altimetry missions and to the peculiarities of the coastline shape at the coastal latitudes of the incident tracks. The relative contribution of Ekman pumping and Ekman transport to the total transport is also estimated indicating a comparable contribution off Chile while transport associated to Ekman pumping is on average-1.4 larger than Ekman transport off Peru. Despite the aliasing effect associated with the weak repetitivity of the satellite orbit and the high frequency variability of the winds in this region, the analysis suggests that the seasonal cycle of the surface winds near the coast could be resolved at least off Peru.

AB Forest fires are incidents of great importance in Mediterranean environments. Landsat data have proven to be suitable for evaluating post-fire vegetation damage and determining different levels of burn severity, which is crucial for planning post-fire rehabilitation. This study assessed the utility of combined Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) fraction images and Land Surface Temperature (LST) to accurately map burn severity. We studied a large convection-dominated wildfire, which occurred on 19-21 September 2012 in Spain, in a zone dominated by Pinus pinaster Ait. Burn severity degree (low, moderate, and high) was measured 2-3 months after fire in 111 field plots using the Composite Burn Index (CBI). Four fraction images were generated using MESMA from the reflective bands of a post-fire Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) image: 1.-char, 2.-green vegetation (GV), 3.-non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil (NPVS) and 4.-shade. The thermal band was converted to LST using a single channel algorithm. Next, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) was used to obtain the probability of each burn severity level from MESMA fraction images and LST. Finally, a burn severity map was generated from the probability images and independently validated using an error matrix, producer and user accuracies per class, and kappa statistic. MLR identified the char fraction image and LST as the only significant explanatory variables when burn severity acted as the response variable. Two burn severity degrees (low-moderate and high) were finally considered to build the final burn severity map. In this way, we reached a higher accuracy (kappa = 0.79) than using the original three burn severity levels (kappa = 0.66). Our study demonstrates the validity of combining fraction images and LST from Landsat data to map burn severity accurately in Mediterranean countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) has the potential to accurately map global vegetation heights and fractional cover metrics using active laser pulse emission/reception. However, large uncertainties in the derivation of data products exist, since multiple physically plausible interpretations of the data are possible. In this study a method is described and evaluated to derive vegetation height and fractional cover from GLAS waveforms by inversion of the FLIGHT radiative transfer model. A lookup-table is constructed giving expected waveforms for a comprehensive set of canopy realisations, and is used to determine the most likely set of biophysical parameters describing the forest structure, consistent with any given GLAS waveform. The parameters retrieved are canopy height, leaf area index (LAI), fractional cover and ground slope. The range of possible parameters consistent with the waveform is used to give a per-retrieval uncertainty estimate for each retrieved parameter. The retrieved estimates were evaluated first using a simulated data set and then validated against airborne laser scanning (ALS) products for three forest sites coincident with GLAS overpasses. Results for height retrieval show mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.71 m for a mixed temperate forest site within Forest of Dean (UK), 3.35 m for the Southern Old Aspen Site, Saskatchewan, Canada, and 5.13 m for a boreal coniferous site in Norunda, Sweden. Fractional cover showed MAE of 0.10 for Forest of Dean and 0.23 for Norunda. Coefficient of determination between ALS and GLAS estimates over the combined dataset gave R-2 values of 0.71 for height and 0.48 for fractional cover, with biases of 3.4 m and 0.02 respectively. Smallest errors were found where overpass dates for ALS data collection closely matched GLAS overpasses. Explicit instrument parameterisation means the method is readily adapted to future planned spaceborne LiDAR instruments such as GEDI. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Agricultural drought is a complex and insidious natural hazard further complicated by crop impacts. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate drought analyses have achieved some success, but the analysis of agricultural drought evolution and integration with crop growth is still lacking. In this study, an Evolution Process-based Multi-sensor Collaboration (EPMC) framework was proposed with the realization that effective agricultural drought assessment requires an integrated approach that considers both drought development and crop phenology. Then the Process-based Accumulated Drought Index (PADI) was designed to quantify the accumulative drought impacts on crops. Based on the monitoring of precipitation, soil moisture, and vegetation conditions, EPMC extracted four main agricultural drought evolution phases termed: (i) latency, (ii) onset, (iii) development, and (iv) recovery. Subsequently, the crop growth stages and water-deficit sensitivity coefficients were integrated with the drought evolution process. Experiments conducted in three different climate regions of China demonstrated that the EPMC framework could clearly depict evolution of the different phases of agricultural drought. Three decades of multi-sensor datasets include monthly precipitation from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), root zone soil moisture from the satellite-model integrated Global Land Data Assimilation System version 2 (GLDAS-2.0), and vegetation condition data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). Results indicated that PADI reliably provided a weekly evaluation of accumulative drought severity instead of a "snapshot". PADI was also compared with the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and multi-time scale of Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Results showed good correlation with short-term SPI at the onset of drought as well as long-term SPI at later stages. Additionally, compared to the correlation with precipitation, soil moisture, and vegetation data alone, it was found that as an integrated model, PADI correlated well with wheat yield loss (Spearman rank correlation coefficient rho was between 0.66 and 0.77, p < 0.05). Therefore, the proposed multi-sensor integrated monitoring framework and index provide a useful and new approach to address the complexity of agricultural drought, with particular relevance to drought impact assessment.

AB Declining forest health can affect crucial ecosystem functions, such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, the regulation of water regimes, the modulation of regional climate and conservation of biodiversity. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) and imaging spectroscopy (IS) are two potentially complementary remote sensing technologies capable of characterizing and monitoring regional forest health. However, the combined use of ALS and IS data to classify the health of individual trees has not yet been assessed. In this study we propose a new approach utilizing ALS and IS combined to characterize the health of individual trees. Firstly, we applied a recently developed bottom-up individual tree delineation algorithm across a structurally complex floodplain eucalypt forest that has experienced episodes of severe dieback over the past six decades. We further calculated ALS and IS indices for delineated tree crowns and used them as predictor variables in machine learning models. We trained and evaluated an object-oriented random forest classifier against field-measured tree crown dieback and transparency ratios, as indicators of eucalypt tree health and crown density, respectively. Our results showed that die back levels of individual trees can be classified using ALS and IS with an overall accuracy of 81% and a kappa score of 0.66, while the classification of tree crown transparency levels had an overall accuracy of 70% and a kappa score of 0.5. Returned pulse width, intensity and density related ALS indices were the most important predictors in the tree health classification, as they accounted for >40% of the variance in the data. At the forest level in terms of die back, 81.5% of correctly delineated trees were classified as healthy, 12.3% as declining and 6.2% as dying or dead. Dieback occurred primarily in areas that were flooded <5% of the time, as quantified by Landsat derived flooding frequency (1986-2011). Our results provide a novel application of ALS and IS to accurately classify the health of individual trees in a structurally complex eucalypt forest, enabling us to prioritize areas for forest health promotion and conservation of biodiversity.

AB The surface reflectance, i.e., satellite derived top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance corrected for the temporally, spatially and spectrally varying scattering and absorbing effects of atmospheric gases and aerosols, is needed to monitor the land surface reliably. For this reason, the surface reflectance, and not TOA reflectance, is used to generate the greater majority of global land products, for example, from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors. Even if atmospheric effects are minimized by sensor design, atmospheric effects are still challenging to correct. In particular, the strong impact of aerosols in the visible and near infrared spectral range can be difficult to correct, because they can be highly discrete in space and time (e.g., smoke plumes) and because of the complex scattering and absorbing properties of aerosols that vary spectrally and with aerosol size, shape, chemistry and density.
   This paper presents the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) atmospheric correction algorithm that has been developed using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum Vectorial (6SV) model, refined to take advantage of the narrow OLI spectral bands (compared to Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM +)), improved radiometric resolution and signal-to-noise. In addition, the algorithm uses the new OLI Coastal aerosol band (0.433-0.450 mu m), which is particularly helpful for retrieving aerosol properties, as it covers shorter wavelengths than the conventional Landsat, TM and ETM + blue bands. A cloud and cloud shadow mask has also been developed using the "cirrus" band (1.360-1.390 pm) available on OLI, and the thermal infrared bands from the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) instrument. The performance of the surface reflectance product from OLI is analyzed over the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites using accurate atmospheric correction (based on in situ measurements of the atmospheric properties), by comparison with the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) adjusted surface reflectance product and by comparison of OLI derived broadband albedo from United States Surface Radiation Budget Network (US SURFRAD) measurements. The results presented clearly show an improvement of Landsat 8 surface reflectance product over the ad-hoc Landsat 5/7 LEDAPS product. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The emissivity of the sea surface is an important parameter for infrared measurements at large incidence angles, and the increased radiance of foam from breaking wave crests, attributed to the higher emissivity of foam over foam-free water, has not been confirmed experimentally at angles above 65 degrees. Here we report on outdoor laboratory experiments performed to confirm model predictions of a dramatic decrease in seawater emissivity at large incidence angles and to provide the first measurements of foam emissivity in this regime. A method is presented using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to measure the spectral emissivity of seawater and foam at incidence angles from 60 degrees to 85 degrees and wavelengths from 3.5-5.5 to 8-14 pm. The emissivity of water and foam are found to decrease dramatically for incidence angles above 65 degrees, with the decrease being less dramatic for foam than for water. The emissivity of foam is found to be higher than that of water for all wavelengths and incidence angles above 65 degrees where the difference is statistically significant. The difference between the emissivity of foam and the emissivity of water increases with incidence angle and reaches a maximum of 023 at 8.9 mu m and 85 degrees incidence. The significant difference between the emissivity of foam and water should be accounted for in infrared models of the sea surface at large incidence angles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new method to assess land surface fractional open water (f(w)) inundation dynamics was developed using high frequency (89 GHz) brightness temperatures (T-b) from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), with other ancillary inputs from AMSR-E and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The resulting 89 GHz fw (fw(WBand)) retrievals provide 10-day temporal fidelity and enhanced (5 km) resolution relative to other passive microwave sensor based land observations. A look-up table was first established to provide reference microwave emissivities for water and land endmembers under a range of atmosphere and land surface conditions. The fw(WBand) retrievals were then obtained on a per pixel basis using difference ratio and double difference methods for respective barren and vegetated soil conditions. The resulting fw(WBand) summer (JJA) seasonal composites correspond favorably (R >= 0.86, p < 0.001) with alternative, finer resolution <= 300 m) static open water maps derived from satellite radar and optical-infrared sensors over a pan Arctic (>= 45 degrees N) domain. The fw(WBand) retrievals also capture significant seasonal drought and flooding events inferred from river discharge records within the major Arctic basins. The fw(WBand) retrievals are found to be reliable for discriminating open water in moderately dense vegetation areas, but with greater uncertainty over barren land. The ability of the fw retrievals to detect surface water under vegetation also decreases exponentially with increasing canopy optical thickness. The new fw(WBand) dataset provides an improved resolution satellite environmental data record documenting open water patterns and inundation dynamics in boreal-Arctic ecosystems experiencing rapid climate change.

AB The Western United States is expected to undergo both extended periods of drought and longer wildfire seasons under forecasted global climate change and it is important to understand how these disturbances will interact and affect recovery and composition of plant communities in the future. In this research paper we describe the temporal response of grassland communities to drought and fire in southern Arizona, where land managers are using repeated, prescribed fire as a habitat restoration tool. Using a 25-year atlas of fire locations, we paired sites with multiple fires to unburned control areas and compare satellite and field-based estimates of vegetation cover over time. Two hundred and fifty Landsat TM images, dating from 1985-2011, were used to derive estimates of Total Vegetation Fractional Cover (TVFC) of live and senescent grass using the Soil-Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI) and post-fire vegetation greenness using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also implemented a Greenness to Cover Index that is the difference of time-standardized SATVITvFc and NDVI values at a given time and location to identify post-fire shifts in native, non-native, and annual plant cover. The results highlight anomalous greening and browning during drought periods related to amounts of annual and non-native plant cover present. Results suggest that aggressive application of prescribed fire may encourage spread of non-native perennial grasses and annual plants, particularly during droughts. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Combining spatially-explicit long-term forest inventory and remotely sensed information from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets through statistical models can be a powerful tool for predicting and mapping above-ground biomass (AGB) at a range of geographic scales. We present and examine a novel modeling approach to improve prediction of AGB and estimate AGB growth using LiDAR data. The proposed model accommodates temporal misalignment between field measurements and remotely sensed data a problem pervasive in such settings by including multiple time-indexed measurements at plot locations to estimate AGB growth. We pursue a Bayesian modeling framework that allows for appropriately complex parameter associations and uncertainty propagation through to prediction. Specifically, we identify a space-varying coefficients model to predict and map AGB and its associated growth simultaneously. The proposed model is assessed using LiDAR data acquired from NASA Goddard's LiDAR, Hyper-spectral & Thermal imager and field inventory data from the Penobscot Experimental Forest in Bradley, Maine. The proposed model outperformed the time-invariant counterpart models in predictive performance as indicated by a substantial reduction in root mean squared error. The proposed model adequately accounts for temporal misalignment through the estimation of forest AGB growth and accommodates residual spatial dependence. Results from this analysis suggest that future AGB models informed using remotely sensed data, such as LiDAR, may be improved by adapting traditional modeling frameworks to account for temporal misalignment and spatial dependence using random effects.

AB Visible, near-infrared and short wave infrared (VNIR/SWIR) hyperspectral imagery has proven to be a useful technique for mapping the soil surface properties over bare soils pixels. Multivariate regression models are usually built linking a set of soil surface properties (response Y-variables) to a set of imaging reflectance spectra over bare soil pixels (predictor X-variables), and then, they are applied to all bare soil pixels to map the soil surface properties. The applicability of VNIR/SWIR hyperspectral imagery for soil properties mapping decreases when surfaces are partially covered by vegetation. The objective of this research was to develop a "Double-Extraction" approach for clay content estimation over semi-vegetated surfaces and to evaluate its performance using VNIR/SWIR HyMap airborne data acquired in a Mediterranean region over an area of 24 km(2). The "Double-Extraction" approach consists of 1) an extraction of a soil reflectance spectrum, S-soil, using a semi-blind source separation (SBSS) technique applied to couples of semi-vegetated spectra and 2) an extraction of clay content from the soil reflectance spectrum S-soli using a multivariate regression method. The source separation approach is semi blind due to the use of available knowledge about expected soil and vegetation spectra. The multiplicative algorithm of Lee & Seung, belonging to the family of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods, is used to solve the blind source separation (BSS) problem. The multivariate regression method used in this study is the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method. The "Double-Extraction" approach was compared to a "Direct" approach consisting of the application of the multivariate regression model built from bare soil spectra over the semi-vegetated area.
   Our results showed poor prediction performances for both approaches when applied to all pixels; however, a slight improvement was observed when correcting the bias prediction that occurs when using the PLSR model. Conversely, satisfactory prediction performances were obtained by restricting the prediction to the weakly vegetated area (NDVI < 0.55) that covered 63% of the study area. The resulting clay map over this restricted vegetated area exhibited patterns of variations that matched the previous expertise acquired on the spatial structures of soils in this area.

AB Taking advantage of the spatially dense, multi-year time series of global Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) from two concurrent satellite missions, the spatial and temporal decorrelation scales of SSS in the Tropical Atlantic 30 degrees N-30 degrees S are quantified for the first time from SMOS and Aquarius observations. Given the dominance of the seasonal cycle in SSS variability in the region, the length scales are calculated both for the mean and anomaly (i.e. seasonal cycle removed) SSS fields. Different 7-10 days composite SSS products from the two missions are examined to explore the possible effects of varying resolution, bias corrections and averaging characteristics. With the seasonal cycle retained, the SSS field is characterized by strongly anisotropic spatial variability. Homogeneous SSS variations in the Tropics have the longest zonal scales of over similar to 2000 km and long temporal scales of up to similar to 70-80 days, as shown by both SMOS and Aquarius. The longest meridional scales, reaching over similar to 1000 km, are seen in the South Atlantic between similar to 10 degrees-25 degrees S, most discernible in Aquarius data. The longest temporal scales of SSS variability are reported by both satellites to occur in the North-West Atlantic region 15 degrees-30 degrees N, at the Southern end of the Sargasso Sea, with SSS persisting for up to 150-200 days. The removal of the seasonal cycle results in a noticeable decrease in the spatio-temporal decorrelation scales over most of the basin. Overall, with the exception of the differences in the South Atlantic, there is general agreement between the spatial and temporal scales of SSS from the two satellites and different products, despite differences in individual product calibration and resolution characteristics. These new estimates of spatio-temporal decorrelation scales of SSS improve our knowledge of the processes and mechanisms controlling the Tropical Atlantic SSS variability, and provide valuable information for a wide range of oceanographic and modelling applications.

AB Land Surface Temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of land-surface processes on regional and global scales, combining the results of all surface-atmosphere interactions and energy fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere. With the advent of the ESA's Sentinel 3 (S3) satellite, accurate LST retrieval methodologies exploiting the synergy between OLCI and SLSTR instruments can be developed. In this paper we propose a candidate methodology for retrieving LST from data acquired with the forthcoming S3 instruments. The LST algorithm is based on the Split-Window (SW) technique with an explicit dependence on surface emissivity, in contrast to the AATSR level 2 algorithm with emissivity dependence embedded in the algorithm coefficients. Performance of the methodology is assessed by using MERIS/AATSR pairs (instruments with similar characteristics to OLCI and SLSTR, respectively). LST retrievals using different datasets of input emissivity are validated against in situ data measured along one year (2011) in five test sites and intercompared to the standard AATSR level 2 products. Validation results show that LST is retrieved with the proposed SW algorithm typically with RMSE below 2 K, providing slightly better results than the AATSR level 2 product. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it allows for improvements in input emissivities to be directly translated into improved LST retrievals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this study, we investigate dominant backscattering mechanisms under different soil moisture (SM) and roughness conditions for bare sandy soils, and discuss potential impacts on active microwave algorithms for soil moisture estimation. This study used ground-based observations of backscattering coefficient (a) over three drydown periods. Under rough soil conditions, surface scattering was the dominant mechanism during both dry and wet periods, and the sigma(0) followed a power-law relationship with SM, with R-2 values > 0.86. However, under smooth soil conditions, the relationship was negative for SM < 0.07 m(3)/m(3). A simple volume scattering model was used to provide plausible explanation for such a behavior due to volume scattering. Sensitivities of sigma(0) to SM using both observed and modeled sigma(0) were analyzed. The observed sensitivity was higher for smooth soil than that for rough soil, when surface scattering was the dominant mechanism, while the sensitivity estimated by the AIEM model was largely unaffected by surface roughness. Observations at VV-pol were more sensitive to SM than at other polarizations by up to 1 dB/0.01m(3)/m(3) for rough soil, while the AIEM model estimated similar sensitivities at both VV and HH-pol, with the maximum difference between the modeled and observed sensitivities of 3 dB/0.01m(3)/m(3). This study demonstrates that volume scattering under dry, smooth conditions and a non-linear relationship between sigma(0) and SM under rough conditions in sandy soils may have significant impacts on estimate of SM using active algorithms.

AB High spatial resolution top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo data is needed to study the radiative forcing of natural or anthropogenic events at regional scales. However, existing products are typically estimated using broadband sensors with coarse spatial resolutions. This paper presents a hybrid method to retrieve TOA albedo over land from multispectral data collected by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at its native spatial resolution. The approach is based on extensive atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) simulations using representative surface and atmospheric conditions as inputs. The clear-sky algorithm explicitly takes surface reflectance anisotropy into account using the POLDER3/PARASOL bidirectional reflectance distribution function database as the boundary condition of RT simulations to first generate TOA spectral albedos and then convert them to broadband albedo. In the cloudy-sky method, surfaces are assumed to be Lambertian and surface spectra over the shortwave spectrum are used to directly obtain TOA broadband albedo. The TOA albedo retrieved from MODIS was compared with the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) TOA flux products, using twelve days of global data (one day each month) in 2007. The two data sets are in good agreement, with a root mean square difference (RMSD) of 0.036 (8.6%) for all Terra instantaneous data and 0.039 (9.1%) for all Aqua instantaneous data. Further analysis revealed that larger discrepancies mainly occurred at pixels of large solar or view zenith angles. RMSD between the two data sets was reduced to similar to 0.02 when the solar zenith angles were limited to 60 and the view zenith angles were limited to 30 degrees. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Wetlands are valuable ecosystems for maintaining biodiversity, but are vulnerable to climate change and land conversion. Despite their importance, wetland hydrology is poorly understood as few tools exist to monitor their hydrologic regime at a landscape scale. This is especially true when monitoring hydrologic change at scales below 30 m, the resolution of one Landsat pixel. To address this, we used spectral mixture analysis (SMA) of a time series of Landsat satellite imagery to reconstruct surface-water hydrographs for 750 wetlands in Douglas County, Washington State, USA, from 1984 to 2011. SMA estimates the fractional abundance of spectra representing physically meaningful materials, known as spectral endmembers, which comprise a mixed pixel, thus providing sub-pixel estimates of surface water extent Endmembers for water and sage steppe were selected directly from each image scene in the Landsat time series, whereas endmembers for salt and wetland vegetation were derived from a mean spectral signature of selected dates spanning the 1984-2011 timeframe. This method worked well (R-2 = 0.99) for even small wetlands (<1800 m(2)) providing a wall-to-wall dataset of reconstructed surface-water hydrographs for wetlands across our study area. We have validated this method only in semi-arid regions. Further research is necessary to extend its validity to other environments. This method can be used to better understand the role of hydrology in wetland ecosystems and as a monitoring tool to identify wetlands undergoing abnormal change. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Wetlands provide important ecosystem functions for water alteration and conservation of bio-diversity, yet they are vulnerable to both human activities and climate changes. Using four decades of Landsat and HJ-1A/1B satellites observations and recently developed classification algorithms, long-term wetland changes in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China, have been investigated in this study. In dry seasons, while the transitions from mudflat to vegetation and vice versa were comparable before 2001, vegetation area increased by 620.8 km(2) (16.6% of the lake area) between 2001 and 2013. In wet seasons, although no obvious land cover changes were observed between 1977 and 2003, similar to 30% of the Nanjishan Wetland National Nature Reserve (NWNNR) in the south lake changed from water to emerged plant during 2003 and 2014. The changing rate of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in dry seasons showed that the vegetation in the lake center regions flourished, while the growth of vegetation in the off-water areas was stressed. Rapid NDVI increase was also found in the NWNNR in the wet seasons. The relationships between the water levels and vegetation coverage also showed two regimes in both dry and wet seasons for the pre-Three Gorges Dam (TGD) period (before 2003) and post-TGD period (after 2003). Analyses of long-term hydrological and meteorological data clearly indicated that while local precipitation remained stable, the water level of Poyang Lake decreased significantly after the impoundment of the TGD, which is likely the main reason for the wetland expansion in recent years.

AB For over two decades nighttime satellite imagery from the Operational Linescan System (OLS) has been used to detect impervious surfaces. However, OLS-based maps suffer from the sensor's coarse resolution (2.7 km/pixel), overglow, and saturation in urban areas, resulting in inaccurate estimates of the extent and degree of impervious surfaces. In order to provide more reliable estimates of impervious surface extent, we used high resolution (similar to 10 m/pixel) nighttime photography from the International Space Station (ISS). Focusing on the city of Berlin in Germany, we produced a map of the extent of impervious surfaces. Our classification was 85% accurate for both user and producer measures. Impervious surfaces omitted by ISS photography were mainly transit roads and airport runways, while green areas and water bodies within the city were falsely identified. An analysis based on ISS imagery classified 55.7% of the study area as impervious, which is only 3.9% less than ground truth (while the OLS-based estimate was 40% higher than ground truth). ISS imagery failed to provide reliable information about the degree of imperviousness for individual pixels (+/- 20% errors); nevertheless it accurately estimated the spatially-averaged degree of imperviousness for the whole study area (30.2% vs. the reference value of 30.1%). These results show that ISS photography is an important source of nighttime imagery for mapping the extent of impervious surfaces, and represents a considerable improvement over OLS capabilities.

AB This study answered the following questions: 1) Is polarimetric C-band SAR (PoISAR) more efficient than dual polarization (dual-pol) C-band SAR for mapping varzea floodplain vegetation types, when using images of a single hydrological period? 2) Are single-season C-band PoISAR images more accurate for mapping varzea vegetation types than dual-season dual-pol C-band SAR images? 3) What are the most efficient polarimetric descriptors for mapping varzea vegetation types? We applied the Random Forests algorithm to classify dual-pol SAR images and polarimetric descriptois derived from two full-polarimetric Radarsat-2 C-band images acquired during the low and high water seasons of Lago Grande de Curuai floodplain, lower Amazon, Brazil. We used the Kappa index of agreement (kappa), Allocation Disagreement (AD) and Quantity Disagreement (QD), and Producer's and User's accuracy measurements to assess the classification results. Our results showed that single-season full-polarimetric C-band data can yield more accurate classifications than single-season dual-pol C-band SAR imagery and similar accuracies to dual-season dual-pol C-band SAR classifications. Still, dual season PoISAR achieved the highest accuracies, showing that seasonality is paramount for obtaining high accuracies in wetland land cover classification, regardless of SAR image type. On average, single-season classifications of low-water periods were less accurate than high-water classifications, likely due to plant phenology and flooding conditions. Classifications using model-based polarimetric decompositions (such as Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi and van Zyl) produced the highest accuracies (kappa greater than 0.8; AD ranging from 7.5% to 2.5%; QD ranging from 15% to 12%), while eigenvector-based decompositions such as Touzi and Cloude-Pottier had the worst accuracies (kappa ranging from 0.5 to 0.7; AD greater than 10%; QD smaller than 10%). Vegetation types with dense canopies (Shrubs, Floodable Forests and Emergent Macrophytes), whose classification is challenging using C-band, were accurately classified using dual-season full-polarimetric SAR data, with Producer's and User's accuracies between 80% and 90%. We conclude that full polarimetric C-band imagery can yield very accurate classifications of varzea vegetation (kappa similar to 0.8, AD similar to 3% and QD similar to 10%) and can be used as an operational tool for forested wetland mapping.

AB Biodiversity is considered to be an essential element of the Earth system, driving important ecosystem services. However, the conservation of biodiversity in a quickly changing world is a challenging task which requires cost-efficient and precise monitoring systems. In the present study, the suitability of airborne discrete-return LiDAR data for the mapping of vascular plant species richness within a Sub-Mediterranean second growth native forest ecosystem was examined. The vascular plant richness of four different layers (total, tree, shrub and herb richness) was modeled using twelve LiDAR-derived variables. As species richness values are typically count data, the corresponding asymmetry and heteroscedasticity in the error distribution has to be considered. In this context, we compared the suitability of random forest (RF) and a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a negative binomial error distribution. Both models were coupled with a feature selection approach to identify the most relevant LiDAR predictors and keep the models parsimonious. The results of RF and GLM agreed that the three most important predictors for all four layers were altitude above sea level, standard deviation of slope and mean canopy height. This was consistent with the preconception of LiDAR's suitability for estimating species richness, which is its capacity to capture three types of information: micro-topographical, macro-topographical and canopy structural. Generalized Linear Models showed higher performances (r(2): 0.66, 050, 052, 0.50; nRMSE: 16.29%, 19.08%, 17.89%, 2131% for total, tree, shrub and herb richness respectively) than RF (r(2): 0.55, 0.33, 0.45, 0.46; nRMSE: 18.30%, 21.90%, 18.95%, 21.00% for total, tree, shrub and herb richness, respectively). Furthermore, the results of the best GLM were more parsimonious (three predictors) and less biased than the best RF models (twelve predictors). We think that this is due to the mentioned non-symmetric error distribution of the species richness values, which RF is unable to properly capture.
   From an ecological perspective, the predicted patterns agreed well with the known vegetation composition of the area. We found especially high species numbers at low elevations and along riversides. In these areas, overlapping distributions of thermopile sderophyllos species, water demanding Valdivian evergreen species and species growing in Nothofagus obliqua forests occur.
   The three main condusions of the study are: 1) appropriate model selection is crucial when working with biodiversity count data; 2) the application of RF for data with non-symmetric error distributions is questionable; and 3) structural and topographic information derived from LiDAR data is useful for predicting local plant species richness.

AB Quantifying and mapping dense tropical forest structure at region to country level have become pressing needs, notably but not exclusively for assessing carbon stocks as part of the Reducing Emission from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD +) process. Fourier texture features from very high spatial resolution passive optical data have shown good potential as non-saturating proxies for stand parameters, including above-ground biomass, within required standards of precision and accuracy. These proxies are, however, sensitive to acquisition geometry (sun view angles), even for acquisition geometries usually in use in VHR sensors, hampering regional or multi-temporal studies combining multiple acquisitions. Our aim was to improve the understanding of this variation formalized in the bidirectional texture function (BTF), and find ways to mitigate it. We used simulated stands and the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model, as well as a collection of Ikonos images over a forest site near Santarem (Para, Brazil). BTF proved dependent on forest structure and displayed strong anisotropy with respect to forward vs. backward scattering modes. But it remained approximately constant over a large range of angular configurations in forward mode, thereby allowing operational use without any correction. This range could be broadened by correcting bias using empirical BTF fitting or (more practically) by inter-calibrating Fourier spectra when some overlap area is available between images. Prediction of a forest structure parameter (D-max, the estimated maximum trunk diameter class) using images in varying configurations then remained unbiased and below 15% relative RMSE except in the vicinity (+/- 10 degrees in the principal bidirectional plane) of the hotspot direction. Near hotspot directions need to be proscribed, as the absence of visible shadows impedes textural description. These results, and the increasing availability of large swath VHR sensor constellations (e.g. SPOT 6-7), open the way to operational broad scale applications for forest characterization, above-ground biomass mapping and multitemporal degradation monitoring.

AB This paper describes the development of a Global 3 arc-second Water Body Map (G3WBM), using an automated algorithm to process multi-temporal Landsat images from the Global Land Survey (GLS) database. We used 33,890 scenes from 4 GLS epochs in order to delineate a seamless water body map, without cloud and ice/snow gaps. Permanent water bodies were distinguished from temporal water-covered areas by calculating the frequency of water body existence from overlapping, multi-temporal, Landsat scenes. By analyzing the frequency of water body existence at 3 arc-second resolution, the G3WBM separates river channels and floodplains more clearly than previous studies. This suggests that the use of multi-temporal images is as important as analysis at a higher resolution for global water body mapping. The global totals of delineated permanent water body area and temporal water-covered area are 3.25 and 0.49 million km(2) respectively, which highlights the importance of river-floodplain separation using multi-temporal images. The accuracy of the water body classification was validated in Hokkaido (Japan) and in the contiguous United States using an existing water body databases. There was almost no commission error, and about 70% of lakes >1 km(2) shows relative water area error <25%. Though smaller water bodies (<1 km(2)) were underestimated mainly due to omission of shoreline pixels, the overall accuracy of the G3WBM should be adequate for larger scale research in hydrology, biogeochemistry, and climate systems and importantly includes a quantification of the temporal nature of global water bodies.

AB Satellite Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is suited to monitoring ground deformation on the scale of volcanic arcs, providing insight into the eruptive cycle over both long and short time periods. However, these measurements are often contaminated with atmospheric artefacts caused by changes in the refractivity of the atmosphere. Here, we test the use of two large-scale atmospheric models, ERA-Interim (ERA-I) and North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), to correct atmospheric uncertainties in InSAR data from the Cascades Volcanic Arc, United States. At Lassen Volcanic Center, we find that NARR reduces interferogram standard deviation in 79% of cases by an average of 22%. Using NARR, we develop a strategy to produce a priori estimates of atmospheric uncertainties on an arc-wide basis. We show that in the Cascades, the RMS variation in range change is dependent upon volcano topography and increases by 0.7 cm per kilometre of relief. We use this to estimate detection thresholds for long-term monitoring of small magnitude (I cm/yr) deformation signals, and short-term monitoring of ground deformation associated with pre-eruptive unrest. This new approach of assessing atmospheric uncertainties a priori is widely applicable to other volcanic arcs, and provides realistic estimates of atmospheric uncertainties suitable for use in near-real-time analysis of InSAR data during periods of volcanic unrest (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB The RAdiative transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) activity focuses on the benchmarking of canopy radiative transfer (RT) models. For the current fourth phase of RAMI, six highly realistic virtual plant environments were constructed on the basis of intensive field data collected from (both deciduous and coniferous) forest stands as well as test sites in Europe and South Africa. Twelve RT modelling groups provided simulations of canopy scale (directional and hemispherically integrated) radiative quantities, as well as a series of binary hemispherical photographs acquired from different locations within the virtual canopies. The simulation results showed much greater variance than those recently analysed for the abstract canopy scenarios of RAMI-IV. Canopy complexity is among the most likely drivers behind operator induced errors that gave rise to the discrepancies. Conformity testing was introduced to separate the simulation results into acceptable and non-acceptable contributions. More specifically, a shared risk approach is used to evaluate the compliance of RI model simulations on the basis of reference data generated with the weighted ensemble averaging technique from ISO-13528. However, using concepts from legal metrology, the uncertainty of this reference solution will be shown to prevent a confident assessment of model performance with respect to the selected tolerance intervals. As an alternative, guarded risk decision rules will be presented to account explicitly for the uncertainty associated with the reference and candidate methods. Both guarded acceptance and guarded rejection approaches are used to make confident statements about the acceptance and/or rejection of RT model simulations with respect to the predefined tolerance intervals.

AB We present a novel inversion algorithm that generates a mass balance field that is simultaneously consistent with independent observations of glacier inventory derived from optical imagery, cryosphere-attributed mass trends derived from satellite gravimetry, and ice surface elevation trends derived from airborne and satellite altimetty. We use this algorithm to assess mass balance across Greenland and the Canadian Arctic over the Sep-2003 to Oct2009 period at 26 km resolution. We evaluate local algorithm-inferred mass balance against forty in situ point observations. This evaluation yields an RMSE of 0.15 mWE/a, and highlights a paucity of in situ observations from regions of high dynamic mass loss and peripheral glaciers. We assess mass losses of 212 +/- 67 Gt/a to the Greenland ice sheet proper, 38 +/- 11 Gt/a to peripheral glaciers in Greenland, and 42 +/- 11 Gt/a to glaciers in the Canadian Arctic These magnitudes of mass loss are dependent on the gravimetry-derived spherical harmonic mass trend we invert We spatially partition the transient glacier continuity equation by differencing algorithminferred mass balance from modeled surface mass balance, in order to solve the horizontal divergence of ice flux as a residual. This residual ice dynamic field infers flux divergence (or submergent flow) in the ice sheet accumulation area and at tidewater margins, and flux convergence (or emergent flow) in land-terminating ablation areas, which is consistent with continuum mechanics theory.

AB The 2013-2015 Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) Preparatory Flight Campaign, using the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER), seeks to demonstrate appropriate sensor signal, spatial and spectral resolution, and orbital pass geometry for a global mission to reveal ecological and climatic gradients expressed in the selected California, USA study area. One of the awarded projects focused on the flight transects covering the coastal ocean to demonstrate that the AVIRIS data can be used to infer phytoplankton functional types at the land-sea interface. Specifically, this project directly assesses whether HyspIRI can provide adequate signal in the complex aquatic environment of the coastal zone to address questions of algal bloom dynamics, water quality, transient responses to human disturbance, river runoff, and red tides. Phytoplankton functional type (PFT), or biodiversity, can be determined from ocean color using the Phytoplankton Detection with Optics (PHYDOTax) algorithm and this information can be used to detect and monitor for harmful algal blooms. PHYDOTax is sensitive to spectral shape and accurate retrievals of ocean color across the visible spectral range is needed. The specific goal of this paper is to address the challenges of sensor capabilities and atmospheric correction in coastal environments by assessing two atmospheric correction methods using AVIRIS data for the retrieval of ocean color for use in derived products of chlorophyll-a and phytoplankton functional type. The atmospheric correction algorithms Atmospheric Removal (ATREM) and Tafkaa were applied to AVIRIS imagery of Monterey Bay, CA collected on 10 April 2013 and 31 October 2013. Data products from the imagery were compared with shipboard measurements including chlorophyll-a from whole-water samples and phytoplanlcton community structure estimated from diagnostic pigment markers using CHEMical TAXonomy (CHEMTAX). Using ATREM and Tafkaa and a selected set of input parameters for the scenes, we were unable to produce accurate retrievals of ocean color for the determination of chlorophyll-a and phytoplanlcton diversity. A modified ATREM correction produced science-quality data in which chlorophyll-a was accurately estimated using the Ocean Color 3 (00) chlorophyll-a algorithm, but biodiversity using PHYDOTax was not accurately estimated. Improvements in sensor calibration, sensitivity, and atmospheric correction of the HyspIRI imagery data set is needed in order to adequately estimate biogeochemically meaningful data products for the ocean such as chlorophyll-a, inherent optical properties, or PFfs. The HyspIRI Science Team is seeking improvements so the HyspIRI Airborne Campaign data set can be used for algorithm development to understand biodiversity and ecosystem function of coastal habitats that are facing increasing threats of human impact and climate change.

AB Direct measurement of depth of the similar to 1900 nm feature (F-1900) caused by molecular water is not possible from hyperspectral data acquired under natural illumination. Proxy measures for depth were evaluated to estimate the true depth of F-1900 from such data. Suitable proxy measures were identified using data acquired by a high-resolution spectrometer (under artificial and natural illumination) and by a hyperspectral imaging sensor (under artificial illumination), with different amounts of simulated atmospheric noise. The best performing proxy measures were used to estimate depth from hyperspectral imagery acquired in the field under natural illumination. Proxy measures comprised a ratio of reflectance, continuum-removed depth at a single wavelength and continuum-removed depth integrated over several wavelengths. For high resolution spectra, a ratio of reflectance at 2017 nm and 1967 nm (Ratio(2017/1967)) and the continuum-removed depth at 1967 nm (CRD1967) were strongly correlated with depth R-2 = 0.98-0.99 and R-2 = 0.95-0.96, respectively. For hyperspectral imagery acquired in the laboratory, Ratio(2017/1967) and CRD1967 were strongly correlated with depth across all levels of atmospheric noise (R-2 = 0.94-0.98 and 0.94-0.97, respectively). Proxy measures using integrated depth performed relatively poorly (R-2 = 0.65-0.86). In independent tests, depth of F-1900 was consistently overestimated by CRD1967 but not by Ratio(2017/1967). Validation of field imagery was done by comparing depth predicted by the proxy measures with depth measured from laboratory imagery of collocated samples from the field. Ratio(2017/1967) derived from a polynomial fit to the data between 1961 and 2134 nm (Ratio(2017/1967)) most closely approximated measured depth. Ratio(2017/1967), derived from the original data either under or overestimated depth. Measures of continuum-removed depth generated from the original data (CRD1967) and from a polynomial fit to the original data (CRDP1967) overestimated the depth of F-1900. This study showed that the depth of F-1900 can be predicted from data acquired under natural illumination however, the choice of proxy measure can have a significant impact upon quantitative estimates.

AB In the Mackenzie Delta, western Arctic Canada, decisions relating to navigation, socio-economics, infrastructure stability, wildlife, vegetation and emergency preparedness are closely related to the delta hydrology. Presented here is a remote sensing decision-tree approach to delineate open-water hydrological features using high-resolution LiDAR terrain, intensity and derivative data. The proposed classification scheme exploits the propensity of LiDAR point attributes and data metrics such as point density and standard deviation (of intensity and elevation) to cluster around characteristic response values over water and non-water surfaces. Due to the impracticability of validating an Arctic water surface classification over such a huge and remote area, results of the hierarchical classification were compared to alternative classifications derived from Radarsat-2 and a manually intensive digitisation technique. Open-water features were identified with >95% accuracy when compared to manually interpreted data. The spatially extensive but temporally distinct information on the hydrological setting of the delta thus extracted forms the basis for calculation of time-invariant parameters such as off-channel storage capacity and hydraulic gradients. In situations where LiDAR data are primarily collected in support of terrain-based watershed hydrologic or floodplain hydraulic assessments, contemporaneous water extent and associated level data are valuable in further characterizing terrain hydrological characteristics.

AB Autumn phenology plays a critical role in regulating growing season duration and can be estimated from satellite remote sensing. However, to date, little work has been undertaken to evaluate the performance of remotely sensed autumn phenology, mainly due to a lack of spatiotemporally compatible field observations. To address this limitation, we conducted intensive ground observations of leaf coloration and leaf fall from 610 deciduous trees at two 625 x 625 m study areas within a mixed forest in northern Wisconsin, USA during 2010 and 2012. We derived landscape phenology (LP) indices by upscaling these plot-level observations to facilitate spatially compatible comparisons with coarse resolution satellite measures. The satellite-derived land surface phenology (LSP) was based on 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data from both standard 16-day composite (MOD13Q1) and daily Nadir Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) products. The results revealed that LSP dormancy onset differed from the observed date of full leaf coloration by 525 days on average (ranging from 0 to 12 days). Furthermore, progression of the autumn season as determined from LSP and LP showed close agreement as increasing LP leaf coloration corresponded to declining NDVI and EVI values. In addition, the end of the leaf coloring phase was marked by a simultaneous stabilizing of both NDVI and EVI time series whereas the timing of the end of the growing season (leaf fall) closely corresponded to minimum NDVI values. These findings clearly support the use of satellite measurements to effectively monitor temporal dynamics of autumn phenology in a temperate mixed forest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With the economic development during the past thirty years, the atmospheric particulate matters over eastern China have reached high levels, causing serious environmental pollution and increased threat to public health. The in situ measurement of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) mass concentration is currently widely employed even if this traditional approach has limitations with respect to wide-range coverage and spatial continuity. Satellite remote sensing provides a possibility to monitor continuously spatial coverage of atmospheric particulate matters. However, the conversion between particle mass concentration and remotely sensed optical parameters is still a big challenge. The existing correlation approaches, i.e. estimating aerosol optical depth (ACM) and surface PM2.5 relationship based on statistics with limited samples, meet more and more limitations with respect to representativeness and applicability. In this paper, we developed a relationship between fine particle extinction and its volume, and thus established a multi-parameter remote sensing formula of dry PM2.5 mass concentration near the ground. To test the method, we utilized AOD and fine mode fraction (FMF) provided by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), supplementing with planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) and relative humidity (RH) obtained from re-analysis data based on model simulation. The remote sensing results of dry PM2.5 mass concentration near the ground over polluted regions of China from October to December 2013 showed that our method revealed well the spatial distribution of PM2.5 in the study area and illustrated clearly the daily variation. The validation against 15 in situ stations showed good performance of the method formulas (mean values of 101 vs. 105 mu g/m(3) for the average of three months of data) and suggested main errors caused by the input data which could be improved in the near future with the advance of satellite remote sensing. We also discussed uncertainty sources and possible improvements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forest height is an important indicator for forest biomass. Ground surface elevation is essential to derive forest height from spaceborne data including interferometric synthetic aperture radar or stereo imagery. Considering the good performance of stereo images in characterizing the vertical structure of forest with non-closed canopies, the main issue addressed in this study is whether stereo imagery acquired in winter can view the ground surface under dense deciduous forest. To make full use of information provided by different observation geometries, the three sets of matching points from different view were combined. Then the vertical distribution of matching points from stereo images was referenced to the vegetation vertical structure and the ground surface elevation from airborne laser scanner (ALS) data. The vertical distribution of matching points from stereo images over typical deciduous forest stands including sparse, disturbed and dense forests were examined. Most matching points were located on the ground surface while some points came from branches and trunks in all the three forest stands. This phenomenon was also observed from a transect of a digital surface model from ZY-3. Twelve elevation indices, including minimum, maximlim, mean elevations and an additional nine percentiles of cumulative probability (El 0 to E90) from the matching points of ZY-3 over 30 m x 30 m cell were compared with the ground surface elevation from ALS data. The results showed that E30 gave the best measurement of ground surface elevation with R-2 > 0.99 and RMSE = 2.54 m. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The synergy of a time series of optical satellite observations from a variety of sensors can be exploited to improve the retrieval of biophysical variables. Information from different sensors may assist in the variable retrieval by limiting potential ambiguities. This involves observations at different spatial, spectral, temporal and angular resolutions, etc. Furthermore, using timely data is of much importance for vegetation monitoring in environmental modeling. While the other necessary variables for such models can be collected daily (e.g. meteorological variables), the temporal resolution of optical sensors (high to intermediate spatial resolutions) does not allow having temporally frequent products of vegetation characteristics due to the revisit time of the sensors and cloud coverage. A multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach applied to a temporal sequence of radiometric data acquired by different sensors can improve mapping and monitoring of vegetation state variables over time. Even when no observations are available due to cloudiness or orbital configuration, the prior retrievals are taken. The study provides a prototype proof of concept for a multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach to retrieve vegetation state variables using data collected by different imaging spectral-radiometers over time. Focus is given to the retrieval of LAI, fCover and chlorophyll content over the agricultural test site in Barrax, Spain. The approach is evaluated over a limited number of remotely sensed data acquired during a short period in the Sentinel-3 Experiment (SEN3EXP 2009) field campaign. A variety of satellite observations including CHRIS-Proba, Landsat TM and ASTER are integrated and combined by means of the multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach and through inversion of a coupled surface-atmosphere radiative transfer model. We applied the iterative Bayesian model inversion in which retrievals of the current observation are incorporated as prior information to the successor observation.
   This paper presents an overview of the results and challenges in utilizing the multi-temporal, multi-sensor approach and the Bayesian inversion technique in the retrieval of terrestrial vegetation properties. Overall, the accuracy obtained with data acquired by multiple sensors over time was higher than when using a single sensor. LAI and fCover were retrieved with RMSE = 0.7 (m(2)/m(2)) and 0.1 respectively (multiple sensors), while RMSE = 1.09 (m(2)/m(2)) and 0.15 respectively, when using data acquired by a single sensor.

AB L-band ALOS-PALSAR images acquired before, during and after the 2010 Merapi eruption have been used to classify and map the pyroclastic deposits emplaced during this VEI-4 event. We characterize the deposits using direct-polarized and cross-polarized L-band SAR data and by combining the information of amplitude evolution with temporal decorrelation. Changes in amplitude of the radar signal enable us to map the pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) and tephra-fall deposits. Radar amplitudes in direct (HH) and cross (HV) polarizations decrease where the valley-confined and overbank block-and-ash flow (BAF) deposits (D1) are emplaced. Rainfall- and runoff-reworked PDC deposits (D2) are characterized by an increase in ground backscattering for HH polarization and a decrease for HV polarization. Ground backscattering transiently increases in both polarizations after pyrodastic surge (D3) and tephra fall (D4) deposition. We use a supervised classification method based on maximum likelihood to map the deposits D1-D4. The temporal decorrelation of the radar signal and the amplitude evolution improve the quality of classification results. Classification derived from ALOS-PALSAR images using the maximum likelihood classification provides a result with 70% classification accuracy for deposits overall. The estimated areas of valley-confined and overbank PDC deposits (either primary or reworked by rainfall and runoff) are consistent with the areas measured by other studies, while the large discrepancy in area estimated for pyroclastic-surge deposits can be partly explained by the strong erosion due to intense rainfall that removed a large part of these thin deposits.

AB Water siltation caused by artisanal gold mining has impacted the Tapajos River Basin in Brazil for the past 40 years, however spatial-temporal information about changes in water quality and consequences to the aquatic environment is lacking. To address this, the Landsat satellite family sensors were used to retrieve total suspended solids (TSS) of the water of the Tapajos River from 1973 to 2013. An image processing approach that includes atmospheric correction, based on the 6S model, and glint removing, based on shortwave infrared correction, was applied and validated with in situ radiometric data. An optimization of the atmospheric correction having dark dense forest spectra as reference was applied and allowed a robust correction of MSS, TM and OLI signal to surface reflectance values. Sediment concentration was estimated based on a non-linear empirical regression between measured TSS and satellite surface reflectance at red band. The multi-temporal analysis of TSS showed that the sediment load in the Tapajos aquatic system is in synchrony with mining activities, and a constant seasonal variation of water siltation is observed throughout the time frame of this study. At the end of the rainy season, mining activities intensify and, coupled with low water flow, TSS increases. During the high water level, TSS concentrations were consistently lower because of high water dilution and low mining activity. In a decadal analysis, a peak of sediment concentration coincides with a peak of gold production in all sites analyzed during early 1990s. More recently, due to the currently gold rush, an increase in suspended solids has been observed mainly in the Novo and Tocantins rivers where industrial mining has been installed.

AB Fog is a crucial driver of epiphyte richness in tropical montane cloud forests but its spatial occurrence and role in tropical lowland areas is poorly understood. Recent studies in French Guiana have reported high epiphyte richness in previously undescribed "tropical lowland cloud forest" (LCF) due to radiation fog. Here, we analyze the spatial extent of fog/low stratus (FLS) in lowland forests of French Guiana using the frequency distribution by means of night-time MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data for the years 2007-2010. The analysis is based on a newly developed dynamic threshold-test method relying on brightness temperature differences between thermal and mid-infrared bands. Individual thresholds for the discrimination between fog/low stratus and cloud-free pixels were retrieved by radiative transfer calculations and validated using discriminant analysis. The thresholds dynamically depend on total precipitable water (TPW) and the terrain-induced maximum possible sub-pixel fog coverage. The results of the new retrieval were validated using in-situ data and compared to results from existing fog detection algorithms, showing an improvement of the new detection scheme regarding the capability to detect sub-pixel fog coverage under varying TPW. FLS frequency maps derived from the novel fog classification scheme indicate a widespread distribution of night-time fog in river valleys, marking a multitude of potential areas for LCF throughout French Guiana. LCF is probably not only a local phenomenon but also may be widely distributed in river valleys in the lowland tropics, with significant consequences for biodiversity mapping in tropical lowland areas.

AB Thermal infrared satellite observations of the Earth's surface are widely used to retrieve Land Surface Temperature (LST) and monitor LST changes around the world. Since January 2012, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) has provided daily observations of LST with a spatial resolution of 750 m at nadir. Comparison of the standard VIIRS LST product with the equivalent daily standard product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection-5 and with ground-based measurements over vegetated and inland water surfaces showed good agreement Analysis indicated the accuracy and precision of the VIIRS product over these cover types was 02 K and 2.0 K respectively provided the analyses included appropriate compensation for any spatial heterogeneity in LST within the validation site. However, comparisons between in situ LST and the VIIRS and MODIS LST over arid and semi-arid regions indicate both satellite products significantly underestimate the LST, and the VIIRS algorithm can have large errors in the retrieved LST over areas of high atmospheric water vapor. Errors of up to 4 K were observed over semi-arid and arid areas due to incorrect characterization of emissivity, and differences of up to 15 K were observed over areas with high atmospheric water content between the VIIRS LST and matching MODIS LST.

AB The effusion rate is the most important parameter to gather when a volcanic eruption occurs, because it controls the way in which a lava body grows, extends and expands, influencing its dimensional properties. Calculation of lava flow volume from thermal images collected by helicopter surveys has been largely used during the last decade for monitoring subaerial effusive eruptions. However, due to the depths where volcanic activity occurs, monitoring submarine volcanic eruptions is a very difficult task The 2011-2012 submarine volcanic eruption at El Hierro, Canary Islands, has provided a unique and excellent opportunity to monitor eruptive processes occurring on the seabed. The use of a hand-held thermal camera during daily helicopter flights allowed us to estimate for the first time the daily and total erupted magma volumes from a submarine eruption. The volume of magma emitted during this eruption has been estimated at 300 Mm(3), giving an average effusion rate of similar to 25 m(3) s(-1). Thermal imagery by helicopter proved to be a fast, inexpensive, safe and reliable technique of monitoring volcanic eruptions when they occur on the shallow seabed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Accurate estimation of carbon fluxes across space and time is of great importance for quantifying global carbon balances. Current production efficiency models for calculation of gross primary production (GPP) depend on estimates of light-use-efficiency (LUE) obtained from look-up tables based on biome type and coarse-resolution meteorological inputs that can introduce uncertainties. Plant function is especially difficult to parameterize in the savanna biome due to the presence of varying mixtures of multiple plant functional types (PFTs) with distinct phenologies and responses to environmental factors. The objective of this study was to find a simple and robust method to accurately up-scale savanna GPP from local, eddy covariance (EC) flux tower GPP measures to regional scales utilizing entirely remote sensing oservations. Here we assessed seasonal patterns of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation products with seasonal EC tower GPP (GPP(EC)) at four sites along an ecological rainfall gradient (the North Australian Tropical Transect, NATT) encompassing tropical wet to dry savannas.
   The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) tracked the seasonal variations of GPP(EC) well at both site- and cross-site levels (R-2 = 0.84). The EVI relationship with GPP(EC) was further strengthened through coupling with ecosystem light-use-efficiency (eLUE), defined as the ratio of GPP to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Two savanna landscape eLUE models, driven by top-of-canopy incident PAR (PAR(TOC)) or top-of-atmosphere incident PAR (PAR(TOA)) were parameterized and investigated. GPP predicted using the eLUE models correlated well with GPP(EC), with R-2 of 0.85 (RMSE = 0.76 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and 0.88 (RMSE = 0.70 g C m(-2) d(-1)) for PAR(TOC) and PAR(TOA), respectively, and were significantly improved compared to the MOD17 GPP product (R-2 = 0.58, RMSE = 1.43 g C m(-2) d(-1)). The eLUE model also minimized the seasonal hysteresis observed between green-up and brown-down in CPPEC and MODIS satellite product relationships, resulting in a consistent estimation of GPP across phenophases. The eWE model effectively integrated the effects of variations in canopy photosynthetic capacity and environmental stress on photosynthesis, thus simplifying the up-scaling of carbon fluxes from tower to regional scale. The results from this study demonstrated that region-wide savanna GPP can be accurately estimated entirely with remote sensing observations without dependency on coarse-resolution ground meteorology or estimation of light-use-efficiency parameters.

AB Photosynthesis (PSN) is a pigment level process in which antenna pigments (predominately chlorophylls) in chloroplasts absorb photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for the photochemical process. PAR absorbed by foliar non-photosynthetic components is not used for PSN. The fraction of PAR absorbed (fAPAR) by a canopy/vegetation (i.e., fAPAR(canopy)) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images, referred to as MOD15A2 FPAR, has been used to compute absorbed PAR (APAR) for PSN (APAR(PSN)) which is utilized to produce the standard MODIS gross primary production (GPP) product, referred to as MOD17A2 GPP. In this study, the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll throughout the canopy (fAPAR(chl)) was retrieved from MODIS images for three AmeriFlux crop fields in Nebraska. There are few studies in the literature that compare the performance of MOD15A2 FPAR versus fAPAR(chl) in GPP estimation. In our study MOD15A2 FPAR and the retrieved fAPAR(chl) were compared with field fAPAR(canopy) and the fraction of PAR absorbed by green leaves of the vegetation (fAPAR(green)). MOD15A2 FPAR overestimated field fAPAR(canopy) in spring and in fall, and underestimated field fAPAR(canopy) in midsummer whereas fAPAR(chl) correctly captured the seasonal phenology. The retrieved fAPAR(chl) agreed well with field fAPAR(green) at early crop growth stage in June, and was less than field fAPAR(green) in late July, August and September. GPP estimates with fAPAR(chl) and with MOD15A2 FPAR were compared to tower flux GPP. GPP simulated with fAPAR(chl) was corroborated with tower flux GPP. Improvements in crop GPP estimation were achieved by replacing MOD15A2 FPAR with fAPAR(chl) which also reduced uncertainties of crop GPP estimates by 1.12-237 g C m(-2) d(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Deforestation and forest degradation are one of the important sources for human induced carbon dioxide emissions and their rates are highest in tropical forests. For man-kind, it is of great importance to track land-use conversions like deforestation, e.g. for sustainable forest management and land use planning, for carbon balancing and to support the implementation of international initiatives like REDD + (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation). SAR (synthetic aperture radar) sensors are suitable to reliably and frequently monitor tropical forests due to their weather independence. The TanDEM-X mission (which is mainly aimed to create a unique global high resolution digital elevation model) currently operates two X-band SAR satellites, acquiring interferometric SAR data for the Earth's entire land surface multiple times. The operational mission provides interferometric data as well as mono- and bistatic scattering coefficients. These datasets are homogenous, globally consistent and are acquired in high spatial resolution. Hence, they may offer a unique basic dataset which could be useful in land cover monitoring.
   Based on first datasets available from the TanDEM-X mission, the main goal of this research is to investigate the information content of TanDEM-X data for mapping forests and other land cover classes in a tropical peatland area. More specifically, the study explores the utility of bistatic features for distinguishing between open and closed forest canopies, which is of relevance in the context of deforestation and forest degradation monitoring. To assess the predominant information content of TanDEM-X data, the importance of information derived from the bistatic system is compared against the monostatic case, usually available from SAR systems. The usefulness of the TanDEM-X mission data, i.e. scattering coefficients, derived textural information and interferometric coherence is investigated via a feature selection process. The resulting optimal feature sets representing a monostatic and a bistatic SAR dataset were used in a subsequent classification to assess the added value of the bistatic TanDEM-X features in the separability of land cover classes. The results obtained indicated that especially the interferometric coherence significantly improved the separability of thematic classes compared to a dataset of monostatic acquisition. The bistatic coherence was mainly governed by volume decorrelation of forest canopy constituents and carries information about the canopy structure which is related to canopy cover. In contrast the bistatic scattering coefficient had no significant contribution to class separability. The classification with coherence and textural information outperformed the classification with the monostatic scattering coefficient and texture by more than 10% and achieved an overall accuracy of 85%. These results indicate that TanDEM-X can serve as a valuable and consistent source for mapping and monitoring tropical forests. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB An ice thickness retrieval algorithm utilizing data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) was developed and applied to Great Bear Lake (GBL) and Great Slave Lake (GSL), Northwest Territories, Canada, for the period 2002-2009. The temporal evolution of vertically polarized AMSR-E brightness temperature (T-B) at 18.7 GHz was explored to estimate ice thickness between the late freeze-up (ice-on) and early break-up (melt-onset) periods. The sensitivity of AMSR-E T-B at H and V polarizations to the seasonal evolution of ice thickness was examined statistically and with forward simulations of T-B using the most recent version of the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) model, which incorporates a freshwater ice layer. The strong relation found between T-B at 18.7 GHz V-pal and ice thickness was exploited for the development of a regression-based ice thickness retrieval algorithm. Simple linear regression equations allow for the estimation of ice thickness on a monthly basis from January to April; one, the Global equation, combines T-B data for GBL and GS', and two others, the Regional equations, use T-B data for each lake alone. Estimated late-winter ice thicknesses on GBL were determined to be on average 5-10 cm thicker than on GSL with the exception of ice season 2005-2006 when it was estimated to be 10 cm thicker on GSL. For both lakes the 2004-2005 and 2008-2009 ice seasons experienced the thickest end-of-winter ice thicknesses, ranging from 130 to 134 cm on GBL and GSL The thinnest end-of-winter ice thicknesses were on average 120 cm on GBL (2005-2006) and 123 cm on GSL (2007-2008). Variability in air temperature, snowfall and subsequent redistribution by wind, and lake depth explain ice thickness variations within and between lakes over the seven winter seasons analyzed. Estimated ice thicknesses from AMSR-E compare well with coincident in situ measurements collected on GBL and GSL over a limited number of ice seasons and sites within the large passive microwave footprints (Mean Bias Error, MBE = 6 cm; Root Mean Square Error, RMSE = 19 cm).

AB Spectral unmixing is the process of decomposing the spectral signature of a mixed pixel into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances. Endmembers are spectra of the pure materials present in the image and abundances at each pixel represent the percentage of each endmember that is present in the pixel. Many spectral unmixing techniques treat a pixel as independent of its neighbors, therefore, only spectral characteristics of the image are used to address the spectral unmixing problem. However, a number of recent studies have found that spatial autocorrelation provides useful information for spectral unmixing. Combining spatial information with its spectral counterpart can lead to improvements in the unmixing results. In this paper, the unmixing methods that incorporate spatial information are termed spatial spectral unmixing, whereas those exploiting only spectral information are referred to as spectral-only unmixing. We summarize the available spatial spectral unmixing methods according to the following three categories: 1) endmember extraction, 2) selection of endmember combinations, and 3) abundance estimation. An experiment-based comparison between representative spatial spectral and spectral-only unmixing methods is also presented in order to demonstrate the advantages of spatial spectral methods. Furthermore, considerations and suggestions of the incorporation of spatial information are provided. With this review, we hope to bring spatial spectral unmixing to the attention of the remote sensing community and stimulate new research initiatives to integrate both spatial and spectral information for unmixing purposes.

AB Sentinel-2 is ESA's medium spatial resolution (10-60 m) super-spectral instrument aimed at ensuring data continuity for global land surface monitoring of Landsat and SPOT. Several simulation studies have been conducted that show the potential of Sentinel-2 for estimating biophysical and biochemical parameters such as leaf area index, chlorophyll and nitrogen, and spectral products such as the red edge position and NDVI time series, providing data continuity for a number of other operational sensors. This paper aims at simulating Sentinel-2 products that are relevant to the geology and soil science community and we compare these to well established band ratio products from ASTER As the basis for the simulation we use airborne hyperspectral imagery from the HyMAP sensor which were spectrally and spatially resampled to the resolutions of ASTER and Sentinel-2 using actual spectral response functions and pixel aggregate, respectively. The simulated image products demonstrate a good correspondence between ASTER and Sentinel-2 VNIR and SWIR bands. A number of band ratios are proposed for Sentinel-2 to derive the following products: ferric iron, ferrous iron, laterite, gossan, ferrous silicate and ferric oxides. These are compared to established band ratios of real ASTER data as well as simulated (from HyMAP) ASTER data and they correlate favourably. Investigating the spatial patterns reveals that there is a good match between the proposed Sentinel-2 band ratio products and those of ASTER. The resulting band ratio products are compared to the local geologic map of the imaged hydrothermal area (the Rodalquilar mining area, Cabo de Gata volcanic field, SE Spain). It is shown that they support the existing conceptual geologic model of the epithermal deposit. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs) is the radiation flux emitted from chlorophyll molecules and can be used as a remote sensing (RS) observable to be linked to plant photosynthesis. Recently, significant progress has been made to quantify Fs from RS data, but both retrieval and interpretation of Fs remain challenging. In the case of airborne sensors with a medium spectral resolution (<2-4 nm), Fs is typically estimated using the Fraunhofer Line Depth (FLD) approach focusing on atmospheric O-2 absorption bands. Most critical for accurate Fs retrievals based on such methods is the characterization of atmospheric scattering and absorption processes during data acquisition. So far, detailed experimental evidence on the retrieval accuracy of airborne measured Fs is lacking. We performed an experiment using a low-flying aircraft equipped with a non-imaging spectrometer acquiring medium spectral resolution data during the course of one day, using a repeat-track approach with changing flight altitudes. Fs in the near infrared was retrieved using a semi-empirical approach constraining the FLD based Fs retrieval from the O-2-A absorption band at 760 nm by using non-fluorescent surfaces. We used a-local sensitivity analysis to assess Fs retrieval biases related to observational and atmospheric parameters. Our results demonstrate a reliable Fs retrieval from airborne data using reference surfaces and indicate the need for accurate knowledge of atmospheric scattering and absorption processes. This study contributes to an estimation of the total error budget of Fs retrievals and will serve as a practical guideline for Fs retrieval schemes to be applied to medium resolution airborne spectroscopy data.

AB The global oceans are a major sink for atmospheric CO2, but the magnitude of this sink is still under question since there are many uncertainties inherent in determining global CO2 fluxes across the air-sea interface. The sign and magnitude of the air-sea fluxes show significant regional and seasonal variation. The gas transfer variables necessary to determine air-sea CO2 fluxes are temperature dependent and studies of global CO2 fluxes commonly rely on measurements of the sub-surface oceanic mixed layer temperature, rather than the cooler skin temperature for these calculations. This surface skin temperature is, on average, about 0.2 K cooler than that of the mixed layer, leading to underestimates of oceanic CO2 uptake when the mixed layer temperature is used for calculations. This study explores the impact, upon both the global annual mean, and as seasonal global distributions, of replacing a mixed layer temperature measurement with a skin temperature measurement to improve global estimates of air-sea CO2 exchange, making use of extensive satellite and in situ measurements. Resulting estimates show, contrary to previous studies, that the contribution of the-cool skin is relatively minor on a global scale, suggesting that calculations can confidently continue to move forward in refining estimates and monitoring air-sea CO2 exchange from remotely sensed parameters, providing better resolution both in time and space in future studies.

AB This study explores the possibility of estimating different stages of ecological succession in tropical dry forests using CHRIS/PROBA hyperspectral and multi-angular satellite images. Tropical dry forests (TDFs) in the Americas are considered one of the most threatened ecosystems in region, experiencing also high rates of secondary growth. In this study, TDFs are studied along three successional stages (early, intermediate and late) in sites across a latitudinal gradient in the Americas. Sites are located in Mexico, Nicaragua and Brazil. Due to their strong annual phenological signal, reflectance values of CHRIS/PROBA Mode-4 were extracted for the dry and wet season, and afterwards analyzed using scatterplots, n-D visualization tools, and Transformed Divergence separability tests. Spectral separation of three successional stages within TDFs was observed in images corresponding to the dry season, at all study sites. In this season, it is possible to discriminate the different successional stages in all viewing angles. For the spectral separation of the three successional stages in images of the wet season, it is required the use of the 18 bands of the sensor. Our analysis also indicates that better spectral separation is achieved at 550, in both seasons. Our results confirm the utility of multi-angular and hyperspectral sensors as a critical tool for environmental planning in TDFs environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Super dust storms occurred over the Middle East and southwest Asia on March 2012. These storms reduced the air quality over the Gulf Region, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan. Airports were shut down due to poor visibility, schools were closed, and hundreds of people were hospitalized with respiratory problems. In order to better understand the effects of such dust storms we have analyzed aerosol optical and radiative properties during this event using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and the Aerosol Robotic Network. Maximum aerosol optical depth (AOD) values occurred on the 18th of March in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, where values of 4.9, 4.4, 4.3, and 4.9 were recorded, respectively. In Oman, the Arabian Sea, and Iran, maximum AOD values occurred on the 19th of March, reaching 4.5, 5, and 5, respectively. The dust storm then spread across Pakistan, passing through Multan, Faisalabad, and Lahore where maximum AOD values of 2.1, 2.6, and 2.7, respectively, were attained on the 20th of March. The maximum aerosol volume size distributions (VSDs) in Lahore occurred on dusty days and minimum VSDs on non-dusty days. The VSD, single scattering albedo, refractive index, and asymmetry parameter values on dusty days suggested that dust aerosols were predominant over anthropogenic aerosols in these urban environments. The shortwave aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) values (on both dusty and non-dusty days) ranged between -50 W m(-2) and -194 W m(-2) (average: -114 +/- 40 W m(-2)) at the earth's surface, and between -31 W m(-2) and -105 W m(-2) (average: -58 +/- 25 W m(-2)) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). The longwave aerosol ARF values ranged between + 6 W m(-2) and + 20W m(-2) (average: + 12 +/- 4 W m(-2)) at the earth's surface, and between + 7 W m(-2) and + 30 W m(-2) (average: + 16 +/- 7 W m(-2)) at the TOA. Longwave radiations therefore produced significant warming, both at the TOA and at the earth's surface. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study presents a decision-tree (DT) approach to classifying heterogeneous land cover types within a northern watershed located in the zone of discontinuous permafrost using airborne LiDAR and high resolution spectral datasets. Results are compared with a more typically applied supervised classification. Increasing errors in discharge resulting from an inaccurate classification are quantified using a distributed hydrological model.
   The hierarchical classification was accurate between 88% and 97% of the validation sub-area, whereas the parallelepiped classification was accurate between 38% and 74% of the same area (despite overall accuracy of similar to 91%, kappa = 0.91). Topographical derivatives were best able to explain variations in land cover types (82% to 96%), whilst spectral and vegetation structural derivatives were less accurate. When compared with field measurements, the hierarchical classification of plateau edges (adjacent to a fen) was within 2 m of measured, 60% of the time, whilst this occurred only 40% of the time when using a spectral classification. When examining the impacts of land cover classification accuracy on modelled discharge, we find that the length of the Hydrological Response Unit defined by the classification (and subject to varying levels of errors) was linearly related to discharge (m(3)) such that an increase in permafrost plateau area would increase discharge by 26% of the total. The methodology presented in this paper clarifies previous classification and modelling studies using Landsat and IKONOS data for the same basin. This study greatly improves upon past classifications in the same area, furthers our understanding of the distribution of connected bogs and fens (as conveyors of water to the basin outlet) within the watershed, and current spatial extents of rapidly thawing permafrost plateaus, which are critical for better understanding the impacts of climate change on these northern environments.

AB Leaf reflectance of monocotyledons generally displays a strong azimuthal anisotropy due to the longitudinal orientation of the veins. The Cook and Torrance (CT) bidirectional reflectance distribution function model was adapted to account for this distinctive feature. The resulting ACT (Anisotropic Cook and Torrance) model is based on the decomposition of the roughness parameter into two perpendicular components. It is evaluated on sorghum (Sorghum halepense) and wheat (Triticum durum) leaf BRF (Bidirectional Reflectance Factor) measurements acquired using a conoscope system. Results show that the ACT model fits the measurements better than azimuthally isotropic surface models: the root mean square error computed over all the BRF measurements for both leaves decreases from approximate to 0.06 for the Lambertian model to approximate to 0.04 for the CT model and down to approximate to 0.03 for the ACT model. The adjusted value of the refraction index is plausible (n approximate to 1.32) for both leaves while the retrieved roughness values perpendicular to the veins (sorghum = 0.56; wheat = 0.46) is about two times larger than that parallel to the veins (sorghum = 0.27; wheat = 0.18). Nonetheless, the observed residual discrepancies between the ACT model simulations and the measurements may be explained mainly by the Lambertian assumption of the volume scattering.

AB Trends in the start or end of growing season (SOS, EOS) of terrestrial vegetation reported previously as latitudinal averages limit the ability to investigate the effects of land cover change and species-wise conditioning on the presented vegetation phenology information. The current research provided more reliable estimates of the trends in the annual growth pattern of terrestrial vegetation occurring at latitudes greater than 45 degrees N. 25 years of satellite-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (GIMMS NDVI) was used and reliable vegetated pixels were analysed to derive the SOS and EOS. The rate of change in SOS and EOS over 25 years was estimated, aggregated and scrutinised at different measurement levels: a) vegetation type, b) percentage vegetative cover, c) core area, d) percentage forest cover loss, and e) latitude zones. The research presents renewed and detailed estimates of the trends in these phenology parameters in these strata. In the >45 degrees N zone, when only reliable pixels were considered, there was an advancement of -0.58 days yr(-1) in SOS and a delay of + 0.64 days yr(-1) in EOS. For homogeneous vegetated areas (91-100% cover at 8 km spatial resolution) the 55-65 degrees N zone showed the maximum change with -1.07 days yr(-1) advancement in SOS for needle leaved deciduous vegetation, and -1.06 days yr(-1) delay in EOS for broad leaved deciduous vegetation. Overall, the increasing trend in EOS during senescence (September to November) was greater in magnitude than the decreasing trend in SOS during spring (March to May) and the change in EOS was more consistent and greater than that in SOS.

AB Snow cover plays an important role in hydrological processes and global climate change research. Geostationary satellites with high temporal resolution provide multiple observations in one day, which highlights their potential for monitoring real-time snow-cover information. In this paper, data from the Chinese meteorological satellites Fengyun-2D (FY-2D), Fengyun-2E (FY-2E) and Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) was used for snow-cover mapping over China. A new method of detecting snow-cover information is proposed, that combines the Visible and Infrared Spin Scan-Radiometer (VISSR) on board the geostationary satellites FY-2D and FY-2E and the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) on board the polar orbiting satellite FY-3B. The snow cover estimated from Fengyun satellites was compared by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow-cover products (MOD10A1 and MYD10A1), and Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow-cover products. The Fengyun satellite snow-cover images and IMS snow-cover products were validated with meteorological station observations for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 winter seasons. The influence of elevation and land-cover types on the accuracy of snow retrievals was also analyzed. The results showed that the combined use of FY-2D and FY-2E VISSR data reduced cloud obscuration by 30.47% compared to the MODIS products. The validation demonstrated that the accuracy of the final multi-sensor snow-cover images was 91.28%, which is similar to that for IMS snow-cover products. This work indicates that combined data from geostationaly satellites and passive microwave remote sensing monitored snow cover over China to a high level of accuracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Subsurface soil temperature is a key variable of land surface processes and not only responds to but also modulates the interactions of energy fluxes at the Earth's surface. Thermal remote sensing has traditionally been regarded as incapable of detecting the soil temperature beneath the skin-surface. This study shows that thermal remote sensing can be used to estimate soil temperatures. Our results provide insights into thermal observations collected with tandem polar-orbiting satellites when used toward obtaining soil temperatures under clear-sky conditions without the use of any ground-based information or field-measured soil properties.
   We designed an analytical three-time-scale (3-scale, for short) model, dividing the annual cycle of soil temperatures into three subcycles: the annual temperature cycle (ATC), which represents the daily-averaged temperature; the diurnal temperature cycle (DTC), which represents the instantaneous temperature; and the weather-change temperature cycle (WTC), which is divided into two parts to represent both the daily-averaged (WTCavg) and the instantaneous temperature (WTCinst). The DTC and WTCinst were further parameterized into four undetermined variables, including the daily-averaged temperature, thermal inertia, upward surface flux factor, and day-to-day change rate. Thus, under clear-sky conditions, the four thermal measurements in a diurnal cycle recorded with tandem polar-orbiting satellites are sufficient for reconstructing the DTC of both land surface and soil temperatures. Polar-orbiting satellite data from MODE are used to show the model's capability. The results demonstrate that soil temperatures with a spatial resolution of 1 km under snow-free conditions can be generated at any time of a clear-sky day. Validation is performed by using a comparison between the MODIS-inverted and ground-based soil temperatures. The comparison shows that the accuracy of inverted soil temperatures lies between 03 and 2.5 K with an average of approximately 1.5 K. These results open a new frontier in the application of thermal remote sensing wherein soil temperatures with high spatial and temporal resolutions can be remotely estimated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB More accurate estimation of the carbon dioxide flux depends on the improved scientific understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote-sensing-based approaches to continental-scale estimation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) have been developed but coarse spatial resolution is a source of errors. Here we demonstrate a satellite-based method of estimating NEE using Landsat TM/ETM + data and an upscaling framework. The upscaling framework contains flux-footprint climatology modeling, modified regression tree (MRT) analysis and image fusion. By scaling NEE measured at flux towers to landscape and regional scales, this satellite-based method can improve NEE estimation at high spatial-temporal resolution at the landscape scale relative to methods based on MODIS data with coarser spatial-temporal resolution. This method was applied to sixteen flux sites from the Canadian Carbon Program and AmeriFlux networks located in North America, covering forest, grass, and cropland biomes. Compared to a similar method using MODIS data, our estimation is more effective for diagnosing landscape NEE with the same temporal resolution and higher spatial resolution (30 m versus 1 km) (r(2) = 0.7548 vs. 0.5868, RMSE = 1.3979 vs. 1.7497 g C m-(2) day(-1), average error = 0.8950 vs. 1.0178 g C m(-2) day(-1), relative error = 0.47 vs. 0.54 for fused Landsat and MODIS imagery, respectively). We also compared the regional NEE estimations using Carbon Tracker, our method and eddy-covariance observations. This study demonstrates that the data-driven satellite-based NEE diagnosed model can be used to upscale eddy-flux observations to landscape scales with high spatial-temporal resolutions.

AB Spectral vegetation indices can be generalized as a function of surface reflectance with respect to wavelength. However, there is significant information on vegetation structure embedded in the anisotropic effects of the target. In this study, we describe and characterize a new vegetation index, the Anisotropic Flat Index (AFX) that captures this anisotropic scattering information and can be derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) product suite (MOD43A1). The AFX is created by normalization of net scattering magnitude (obtained from volumetric and geometric-optical scattering) with the isotropic scattering. The AFX summarizes the variability of basic dome-bowl anisotropic reflectance patterns of the terrestrial surface. A classification scheme for BRDF typology is created based on AFX archetypes that capture characteristic BRDF shape types. This study fully characterizes AFX in a number of steps. First, sensitivity to random noise and observation geometries is explored by comparing the AFX with other variables derived from field measurements that comprehensively sample the viewing hemisphere. Second, AFX is compared with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values using field measurements from many ground campaigns, as well as global MODIS observations from EOS Land Validation Core Sites (LVCS). Third, a BRDF typology is developed by classification of an a priori database of BRDF archetypes from field measurements, and from MODIS observations that cover the full range of vegetation types from grasslands to closed forest (MCD43A). Fourth, the response of AFX to the parameter variability of canopy architectures and background optical properties for three vegetation types with discontinuous woody canopies is investigated through the use of a 5-Scale BRDF model simulation. Finally, global BRDF archetypes are mapped and discussed through the use of a global high-quality MODIS BRDF/albedo gap filled product (MCD43GF). The results show that the AFX summarizes BRDF archetypes and provides additional information on vegetation structure and other anisotropic reflectance characteristics of the land surface.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is crucial for a wide variety of land-atmosphere studies. A long-term and time-consistent LST product is highly desirable for use in global climate studies. In this study, we developed a method to normalize the Terra-MODIS LST during daytime to a consistent local solar time to generate a time-consistent LST product. A multiple linear regression model for the slope of LST versus the local solar time during the period 10:00-12:00 as a function of the normalized-difference vegetation index, solar zenith angle, and digital elevation model was established using MSG-SEVIRI data. The regression equation was then applied to normalize the Terra-MODIS LST during daytime to a consistent local solar time (i.e., 11:00 local solar time). The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated using MSG-SEVIRI-derived LST data. The results indicate that the root mean square error of the differences between the LST before temporal normalization and the actual LST (derived from MSG-SEVIRI data) is approximately 1.5 K, whereas those between the LST after temporal normalization and the actual LST is approximately 0.5 K.

AB The U.S. currently leads the world in installed geothermal capacity with power plants in eight states, and exploration for new electrical-grade geothermal systems is ongoing. Geothermal systems at depth may be identified at the surface by hot springs and fumaroles or by minerals produced by thermal fluids (hydrothermal alteration and hot spring deposits). Northern Fish Lake Valley, Nevada hosts two previously known geothermal fields. This study expanded prospects and identified new areas for future exploration within the valley. We demonstrated the potential for using remote sensing data to evaluate regions that are not well explored. We used visible, near, and shortwave infrared (0.4-2.5 mu m) remote sensing data to map surficial mineralogy. Data were collected by three airborne imaging spectrometer instruments, AVIRIS, HyMap, and ProSpecTIR, each over different parts of Fish Lake Valley. Minerals were identified using diagnostic spectral features. We verified remote sensing results in the field using a portable spectrometer to confirm agreement between field and remote spectra.
   The discovery of additional geothermal resources in Fish Lake Valley may provide the necessary added incentive to build costly transmission lines to this remote location. We used remote sensing data to delineate four new targets for future geothermal exploration in northern Fish Lake Valley. Two new areas of sinter and travertine deposits were identified northwest of the playa, likely deposited around fault-controlled hot springs during the Pleistocene when the water table was higher. Previously undocumented Miocene crystalline travertine was identified within the Emigrant Hills. Argillic alteration was mapped within ranges, where thermal fluids were likely discharged from faults to alter rhyolite tuff. Here we explain our data processing techniques which include a novel decorrelation stretch designed for geothermal prospecting, and discuss how remote sensing results guided our interpretation of the region's geothermal systems.

AB We measured the rate of dispersal of saltcedar leaf beetles (Diorhabda carinulata), a defoliating insect released on western rivers to control saltcedar shrubs (Tamarix spp.), on a 63 km reach of the Virgin River, U.S. Dispersal was measured by satellite imagery, ground surveys and phenocams. Pixels from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra satellite showed a sharp drop in NDVI in midsummer followed by recovery, correlated with defoliation events as revealed in networked digital camera images and ground surveys. Ground surveys and MODIS imagery showed that beetle damage progressed downstream at a rate of about 25 km yr(-1) in 2010 and 2011, producing a 50% reduction in saltcedar leaf area index and evapotranspiration by 2012, as estimated by algorithms based on MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index values and local meteorological data for Mesquite, Nevada. This reduction is the equivalent of 10.4% of mean annual river flows on this river reach. Our results confirm other observations that saltcedar beetles are dispersing much faster than originally predicted in pre-release biological assessments, presenting new challenges and opportunities for land, water and wildlife managers on western rivers. Despite relatively coarse resolution (250 m) and gridding artifacts, single MODIS pixels can be useful in tracking the effects of defoliating insects in riparian corridors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a radiative transfer model for the emissivity of vertically structured layers of sea foam at microwave frequencies from 1 GHz to 37 GHz. The main features of the model are: (1) Continuous variation in the amount of air in the foam layer depth which affects foam emission through vertically inhomogeneous foam properties. (2) Various radiative terms contributing to foam emissivity, such as upwelling and downwelling emissions within the foam layer, emission of seawater beneath the foam, and multiple reflections of these components at the foam layer interfaces. (3) Distribution of foam layer thicknesses. The dependencies of foam emissivity on foam layer thickness and incidence angle are presented. Analysis of the model sensitivity to input parameters shows that its results are most affected by the choice of the void fraction value at the air-foam interface. Comparisons of the model results to published experimental and modeling data show that with fewer model variables and inputs, and with a single tuning parameter, the model performs as well as, or better than, other physical models.

AB Verticillium wilt (VW) caused by the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb, is the most limiting disease in all traditional olive-growing regions worldwide. This pathogen colonizes the vascular system of plants, blocking water flow and eventually inducing water stress. The present study explored the use of high-resolution thermal imagery, chlorophyll fluorescence, structural and physiological indices (xanthophyll, chlorophyll a + b, carotenoids and blue/green/red B/G/R indices) calculated from multispectral and hyperspectral imagery as early indicators of water stress caused by VW infection and severity. The study was conducted in two olive orchards naturally infected with V. dahliae. Time series of airborne thermal, multispectral and hyperspectral imagery was acquired in three consecutive years and related to VW severity at the time of the flights. Concurrently to the airborne campaigns, field measurements conducted at leaf and tree-crown levels showed a significant increase in crown temperature (Tc) minus air temperature (Ta) and a decrease in leaf stomatal conductance (G) across VW severity levels, identifying VW-infected trees at early stages of the disease. Higher Tc Ta and G values measured in the field were associated with higher VW severity levels. At leaf level, the reduction in G caused by VW infection was associated with a significant increase in the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI570) and a decrease in chlorophyll fluorescence (F). The airborne flights enabled the early detection of VW by using canopy-level image-derived airborne Tc Ta, Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) calculated from the thermal imagery, blue/blue-green/blue-red ratios (B/BG/BR indices) and chlorophyll fluorescence, confirming the results obtained in the field. Airborne Tc Ta showed rising values with a significant increase of -2 K at low VW severity levels, and was significantly correlated with G (R-2 = 0.76, P = 0.002) and PRI570 (R-2 = 0.51, P = 0.032). Early stages of disease development could be differentiated based on a CWSI increase as VW developed, obtaining a strong correlation with G (R-2 = 0.83, P < 0.001). Likewise, the canopy-level chlorophyll fluorescence dropped at high VW severity levels, showing a significant increase as disease progressed. These results indicate the potentials of an early detection of V. dahliae infection and discrimination of VW severity levels using remote sensing. Indicators based on crown temperature such as CWSI, and visible ratios B/BG/BR as well as fluorescence were effective in detecting VW at early stages of disease development. In affected trees, the structural indices PRI, chlorophyll and carotenoid indices, and the R/G ratio were good indicators to assess the damage caused by the disease. 2013 Elsevier Inc.

TI Methane concentrations over Monsoon Asia as observed by SCIAMACHY:
   Signals of methane emission from rice cultivation

AB We have analyzed the column-averaged CH4 concentration (xCH(4)) using scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric chartography (SCIAMACHY) and compared the data with the bottom-up emission inventory data sets and other satellite-derived indices such as the land-surface water coverge (LSWC) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The geographical distribution of high CH4 values corresponds to strong emissions from regions where rice is cultivated, as indicated in the inventory maps. The Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) between xCH(4) and the rice emission inventory data are observed to be greater than similar to 0.6 over typical rice fields, with outstanding r-values of similar to 0.8 in the Ganges Basin, Myanmar, and Thailand. This suggests that the emission of CH4 from rice cultivation mainly controls the seasonality of the CH4 concentration over such regions. The correlation between xCH(4) and LSWC and NDVI is also as large as 0.6. In Southeast Asia, the r-values of xCH4 with bottom-up inventory data that includes all categories are not as high as those with the emission, as estimated from the rice category only. This is indicative of the relative importance of rice emissions among all other emission categories in Southeast Asia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The capacity to remotely identify impacts of ozone on conifers in California, USA and Catalonia, Spain was investigated using remote sensing and terrain-driven GIS analyses related to plant water relations and ozone uptake. The Ozone Injury Index (OII) field metric applied to Pinus ponderosa and Pinus jeffreyi in the USA and adapted to Pinus uncinata in Spain included visible chlorotic mottling, needle retention, needle length, and crown depth. Species classifications of AVIRIS and CASI hyperspectral imagery all approached 80% overall accuracy for the target bioindicator species. Remote sensing vegetation indices correlated best with longer-wavelength SWIR indices from the AVIRIS data in California, with the exception of the Photosynthetic Reflectance Index (PRI) correlation with the 011 Visual Component (OIIVI), which was also the highest direct correlation in Catalonia. In Catalonia, the OIIVI alone and its subparts correlated better with the CASI data than with the full OIL namely the PRI (R-2 = 0.28, p = 0.0044 for OIIVI-amount and R-2 = 0.33 and p = 0.0016 for OIIVI-severity). Stepwise regression models of ozone injury developed using remote sensing indices combined with terrain-derived GIS variables were significant for OII in California (R-2 = 0.59, p < 0.0001) and in Catalonia (R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.0001 for OIIVI). Multiple regression models of ozone injury including a three year average of O-3 exposure were significant both with imaging spectroscopy indices alone (R-2 = 0.56, p < 0.0001) and with topographic variables added (R-2 = 0.77, p < 0.0001) in Catalonia. Applying the multivariate models to image classifications could provide useful maps useful for ozone impact monitoring but requires further validation before being considered operational.

AB Clumping index, the measure of foliage grouping relative to a random distribution of leaves in space, is a key structural parameter of plant canopies that influences canopy radiation regimes and controls canopy photosynthesis and other land-atmosphere interactions. In this study, we retrieve the clumping index using the original 275 m resolution data of the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument over a set of sites representing diverse biomes and different canopy structures. Also for the first time, the MISR derived clumping index values are directly validated with both in-situ vertical profiles and seasonal trajectories of clumping index. Our results illustrate that MISR data with 275 m allow clumping index estimates at much more pertinent scales (both spatial and temporal) than previous maps from Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for modeling local carbon and energy fluxes.

AB Intra-annual and interannual variability of satellite derived chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) is studied using wavelet analysis during 1997-2010 in tropical, subtropical and temperate zones of the Eastern North Atlantic (20-50 degrees N and 5-40 degrees W). It was found that during the period of observations the Chl dynamics was dominated by the four major periodicities: 0.5-year, 1-year, 2-year and 3-5-year cycles. The 0.5-year wavelet cycle predominantly is a function of the intensity of the secondary bloom (autumn or summer); it attains maximum of 80-100% of the fundamental seasonal (1-year) cycle in the subtropics and 30-60% in the southern tropics. The 2-year and 3-5-year wavelet cycles characterise the variations in the annual mean Chl concentrations and their amplitudes change in-parallel with the change of the amplitude of the 1-year cycle. Expressed as the percentage of the 1-year cycle, the interannual cycles play the most significant role in Chl variations in the southern tropics (40-50%). The 2-year and 3-5 year cycles are also present in the North Atlantic Oscillation Index (NAOI), but only the 3-5-year Chl cycle is closely coupled with the corresponding cycle in the NAOI. Weak correlations with the 2-year cycle are suggested to be a result of the NAOI variations that does not always directly translate into a biological response. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Worldwide, cropland ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon (C) cycle. However, quantifying and understanding the cropland C cycle are complex, due to variable environmental drivers, varied management practices and often highly heterogeneous landscapes. Efforts to upscale processes using simulation models must resolve these challenges. In this study we show how data assimilation (DA) approaches can link C cycle modelling to Earth observation (EO) and reduce uncertainty in upscaling. We evaluate a framework for the assimilation of leaf area index (LAI) time-series, derived from EO optical and radar sensors, for state-updating a model of crop development and C fluxes. Sensors are selected with fine spatial resolutions (20-50 m) to resolve variability across field sizes typically used in European agriculture (1.5-97.6 ha). Sequential DA is used to improve the canopy development simulation, which is validated by comparing time-series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) predictions to independent eddy covariance observations at multiple European cereal crop sites. From assimilating all EO LAI estimates, results indicated adjustments in LAI and, through an enhanced representation of C exchanges, the predicted at-harvest cumulative NEE was improved for all sites by an average of 69% when compared to the model without DA. However, using radar sensors, being relatively unaffected by cloud cover and more sensitive to the structural properties of crops, further improvements were achieved when compared to the combined, and individual, use of optical data. Specifically, when assimilating radar LAI estimates only, the cumulative NEE estimation was improved by 79% when compared to the simulation without DA. Future developments would include the assimilation of additional state variables, such as soil moisture. (c) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A two-source model (TSM) for surface energy balance, considering explicitly soil and vegetation components, was tested under water stress conditions. The TSM evaluated estimates the sensible heat flux (H) using the surface-air thermal gradient and the latent heat flux (LE) as a residual from the surface energy balance equation. The analysis was performed in a semiarid Mediterranean tussock grassland in southeast Spain, where H is the dominant flux and LE rates are low, challenging conditions under which the TSM has not been validated before. We evaluated two different resistance schemes: series and parallel; as well as the iterative algorithm included in the TSM to disaggregate the soil-surface composite temperature into its separate components. Continuous field measurements of composite soil-vegetation surface temperature (T-R) and bare soil temperature (T-s) from thermal infrared sensors were used for model testing along with canopy temperature estimates (T'(c)), derived from T-R and T-s.
   Comparisons with Eddy covariance and field data showed that the TSM produced reliable estimates of net radiation (Rn) and H fluxes, with errors of similar to 30% and similar to 10%, respectively, but not for LE, with errors similar to 90%. Despite of lower errors (similar to 10%) in estimating H using parallel resistance, the series scheme was more robust showing slightly higher correlations (r(2) = 0.78-0.80 vs. r(2) = 0.75-0.77) and allowing a better disaggregadon of soil and canopy fluxes. Differences between model runs using the iterative algorithm to disaggregate T-R and the simplified version that uses separate inputs of T-s and T'(c) were minor. This demonstrates the robustness of the iterative procedure to disaggregate a composite soil-vegetation temperature into separate soil and vegetation components in semiarid environments with good prospects for image applications.

AB In interior Alaska, wildfires change gross primary production (GPP) after the initial disturbance. The impact of fires on GPP is spatially heterogeneous, which is difficult to evaluate by limited point-based comparisons or is insufficient to assess by satellite vegetation index. The direct prefire and postfire comparison is widely used, but the recovery identification may become biased due to interannual climate variability. The objective of this study is to propose a method to quantify the spatially explicit GPP change caused by fires and succession. We collected three Landsat images acquired on 13 July 2004,5 August 2004, and 6 September 2004 to examine the GPP recovery of burned area from 1987 to 2004. A prefire Landsat image acquired in 1986 was used to reconstruct satellite images assuming that the fires of 1987-2004 had not occurred. We used a light-use efficiency model to estimate the GPP. This model was driven by maximum light-use efficiency (E-max) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (F-PAR). We applied this model to two scenarios (i.e., an actual postfire scenario and an assuming-no-fire scenario), where the changes in E-max and F-PAR were taken into account. The changes in E-max were represented by the change in land cover of evergreen needleleaf forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, and shrub/grass mixed, whose E-max was determined from three fire chronosequence flux towers as 1.1556, 13336, and 0.5098 gC/MJ PAR. The changes in F-PAR were inferred from NDVI change between the actual postfire NDVI and the reconstructed NDVI. After GPP quantification for July, August, and September 2004, we calculated the difference between the two scenarios in absolute and percent GPP changes. Our results showed rapid recovery of GPP post-fire with a 24% recovery immediately after burning and 43% one year later. For the fire scars with an age range of 2-17 years, the recovery rate ranged from 54% to 95%. In addition to the averaging, our approach further revealed the spatial heterogeneity of fire impact on GPP, allowing one to examine the spatially explicit GPP change caused by fires.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a central parameter for surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies, in which thermal remote sensing plays a key role. Traditionally, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), percent green vegetation (%GV), and percent impervious surface area (%ISA), have been widely applied to examine the impacts of land cover compositions on SUHI. Urban thermal pattern, however, is a complicated physical phenomenon involving a series of environmental factors, and it is insufficient to employ only one indicator for the explanation of the SUHI phenomenon. Therefore, considering different thermal properties of various land cover compositions, this study proposed a two-step physically based method, the spectral unmixing and thermal mixing (SUTM) model, to examine the impacts of typical land cover compositions on urban thermal pattern. The performance of SUTM was compared with those of linear and non-linear (quadratic) regression models with NDVI, %GV, and %ISA as individual independent variables. Results indicate that SUTM outperforms all regression models, with the lowest root mean square error (2.89 K) and mean absolute error (2.11 K). Moreover, when the accuracy was assessed at five interval levels of percent impervious surface area, it indicates that SUTM performs consistently well in both rural and urban areas. Comparatively, NDVI and %GV-based regression models perform well in rural areas, but poor in urban areas, whereas %ISA-based models perform well in urban areas, but relatively poor in rural areas. This study found that soil, including both moist and dry soil, has significant impacts on modeling SUHI. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate estimation of spatially distributed air temperature (Ta) is useful for a wide range of disciplines such as hydrology, meteorology and ecology. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (Ts) products hold the potential to get spatial estimates of land surface temperature at high temporal (daily) and spatial resolution (1 km) across the world. In this paper, the possibility of retrieving high-resolution Ta data from MODIS Ts data on both Terra and Aqua satellites was investigated over Xiangride River basin in the north Tibetan Plateau. The results of statistical analysis show that during the night MODIS Ts data on Terra satellite provides a good estimation of daily minimum air temperature with RMSE=2.97 degrees C, MAE=237 degrees C, and r=0.94, while during the day the difference between Terra MODIS Ts data and daily maximum air temperature is large with RMSE=7.45 degrees C, MAE=621 degrees C, and r=0.83. In order to improve the accuracy of the estimation of daily maximum air temperature, the temperature-vegetation index (TVX) method was used in this paper. By lowering the threshold for the negative correlation coefficient between NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and Ts to -0.1, the TVX method was applied to MODIS land products to estimate daily maximum air temperature successfully for the first time. The validation results show that the TVX method has improved the accuracy of daily maximum air temperature significantly with RMSE=3.79 degrees C, MAE=3.03 degrees C, and r=0.83. Finally, the diurnal air temperature variation was simulated using a simple sine curve model for the period 21:00-9:00 UCT. The simulation results were in good agreement with observed values with RMSE=3.43 degrees C, MAE=2.54 degrees C, and r=0.86. The results of this study show that daily maximum and minimum air temperature can be retrieved effectively from MODIS land surface products through the use of TVX method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Combining remote sensing data and socio-economic data to quantitatively analyze urban growth is a topic growing in importance. We used square grid cells to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban growth in the Tokyo, japan, metropolitan area by using remote sensing imagery from 1972 to 2011 and census population data from 1970 to 2010. First, we used the subspace classification method to produce land-cover maps by using Landsat images from 1972, 1987, 2001, and 2011. Next, we integrated the land-cover maps with basic grid cell maps (using the standard 1 km(2) grid cell system of Japan) to represent the proportion of each land-cover category within each 1 km(2) grid cell area. Finally, we combined the proportional land-cover maps and population census data to investigate the relationship between land-cover changes and population density change based on grid cells. By using grid cells it is straightforward to (i) integrate remote sensing, geographic information system (GIS), and statistical data within the cells; (ii) quantify land-cover changes in terms of the percentage of area affected and rates of change and compare them with population census data: and (iii) analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of urban growth patterns. Between 1972 and 2011 the rapid expansion of the urban area was accompanied by extensive shrinking of the agricultural area around the new settlements. As a result, the urban growth rate exceeded the population growth rate by more than a factor of 2.6. We used the grid cells to investigate the spatial relationship between the changes of land-cover classes and population density change, and then calculated the correlation coefficients of land-cover categories and population density changes for 3 intervals between 1972 and 2011 (1972-1987, 1987-2001, and 2001-2011). The results showed that the urban/built-up density decreased in the metropolitan inner core as the city center experienced depopulation. Spatial correlation analysis showed a strong positive correlation between urban expansion and population density change (r = 0.59), and that urban expansion was strongly negatively correlated with cropland change (r = -0.77). The results also demonstrated that grid cells allow remote sensing and statistics data to be combined, improving the knowledge, understanding, and analysis of urban dynamics. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Understanding urban environments and their spatio-temporal changes is essential for regional and local planning and environmental management. To facilitate monitoring and analyzing urban environments, remotely sensed data have been applied extensively because of its synoptic view and repeat coverage over large geographic areas. Compared with traditional per-pixel and sub-pixel image analyses, spectral indices have apparent advantages due to their easy implementation. However, most spectral indices are designed to highlight only one land cover, and confusion between other land cover types, in particular impervious surfaces and bare soil, has not been successfully addressed. This study proposes a biophysical composition index (BCI) for simple and convenient derivation of urban biophysical compositions for practical applications following Ridd's conceptual vegetation - impervious surface - soil triangle model by a reexamination of the Tasseled Cap (IC) transformation. Further, this research explores the applicability of BCI in various remotely sensed images at different spatial resolutions. Results indicate that, BCI has a closer relationship with impervious surface abundance than those of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI), with correlation coefficients of approximately 0.8 at various resolutions. Also, the performances of BCI in quantifying vegetation abundance are comparable with NDVI at all three spatial scales. Additionally, with much higher values of separability metrics than any other index, the study confirms that BCI was shown to be the most effective index of the four evaluated for separating impervious surfaces and bare soil.

AB Skin sea surface temperatures (SST) from the infra-red atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI) have been available in the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperatures (GHRSST) L2Pcore format from the EUMETSAT data centre since March 2011. IASI SSTs, produced from version 5.0 of the IASI Product Processing Facility (PPF), have been validated against drifting buoy SSTs and compared to AVHRR SSTs contained with the EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea-Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF) matchup dataset, over the period October 2010 to July 2011. The IASI SSTs were found to be of good quality with a slight cool bias compared to drifting buoys (bias -0.32 K, sigma 0.32 K) and AVHRR SSTs (bias -0.35 K, sigma 0.30 K). The highest quality IASI SSTs had a bias compared to drifting buoys of -0.16 K (sigma 0.33 K). Using three-way collocations of differences between IASI, AVHRR, and drifting buoy SSTs gave IASI SSTs to have a standard deviation of error of 0.28 K. AVHRR 0.13 K, and drifting buoys 0.20 K. IASI and AVHRR SSTs were found to be complementary to each other, giving benefit in different locations. Some residual cloud contamination was observed in the IASI SSTs, contributing to the slight cool bias. For collocations deemed likely to be 100% cloud free, the IASI bias reduces to -0.25 K (sigma 0.39 K) using quality levels 2 to 5, and a bias of -0.09 K (sigma 0.34 K) for observations with quality level 5. In addition, some evidence of increased uncertainties due to comparing point buoy observations with areal satellite observations was seen in the daily statistics for all observation types.

AB We investigate the displacement induced by the 2-3 April 2010 seismic swarm (the largest event being of MI 4.3 magnitude) by means of DInSAR data acquired over the volcano by the Cosmo-SkyMed and ALOS radar systems. Satellite observations, combined with leveling data, allowed us to perform a high-resolution modeling inversion capable of fully capturing the deformation pattern and identifying the mechanism responsible for the PFS seismic activation. The inversion results well explain high gradients in the radar line of sight displacements observed along the fault rupture. The slip distribution model indicates that the fault was characterized by a prevailing left-lateral and normal dip-slip motion with no fault dilation and, hence, excludes that the April 2010 seismic swarm is a response to accommodate the stress change induced by magma intrusions, but it is due to the tectonic loading possibly associated with sliding of the eastern flank of the volcano edifice. These results provide a completely different scenario from that derived for the 22 September 2002 M3.7 earthquake along the PFS, where the co-seismic shear-rupture was accompanied by a tensile mechanism associated with a first attempt of magma intrusion that preceded the lateral eruption occurred here a month later. These two opposite cases provide hints into the behavior of the PFS between quiescence and unrest periods at Etna and pose different implications for eruptive activity prediction and volcano hazard assessment. The dense pattern of ground deformation provided by integration of data from short revisiting time satellite missions, together with refined modeling for fault slip distribution, can be exploited at different volcanic sites, where the activity is controlled by volcano-tectonic interaction processes, for a timely evaluation of the impending hazards.

AB Signals of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) bi-statically reflected off pristine dry snow in Dome-Concordia, Antarctica, were collected during an experimental campaign with the aim of investigating the potential capabilities of these signals to remotely sense dry snow areas. The data have been used to sense the sub-surface structure of the snow by means of a new holographic observable. The obtained reflected signals present interferometric patterns consistent with the coherent superposition of signals reflected in different layers of the snow sub-structure, down to a few hundred meters depth. A forward model has been developed to compare the amplitude and phase behavior of the interferences with the data. A new radio-holographic observable is also defined, to help identify the layer at which the internal reflections occur. This work represents the first step towards the potential use of a space-based GNSS-R mission for densely monitoring the depths of Antarctica's thick dry snow; and/or complementing L-band radiometric observations.

AB Spatiotemporal dimensionality refers to the continuum of spatial and temporal patterns in an image time series. Time-Space characterization refers to a way of representing this continuum of patterns as combinations of spatial and temporal constituents - with a minimum of assumptions about the forms of the patterns. Patterns can be related to processes through modeling. By combining characterization and modeling, two complementary analytical tools can be used together so that each resolves a key limitation of the other. This study describes a straightforward extension of Principal Component Analysis and Spectral Mixture Analysis to multitemporal imagery and illustrates how characterization of the dimensionality and eigenstructure of the data can inform modeling of the processes represented in the data. The relationships among spatiotemporal processes can be represented as combinations of temporal endmembers in a temporal feature space where the dimensions represent different components of the temporal patterns present in the data. The topology of the feature space and the processes being modeled together inform the selection of temporal endmembers and the structure of the model chosen to represent the processes. The dimensionality revealed by the characterization can also provide a partial solution to the problem of endmember variability. The characterization and modeling process is illustrated with the vegetation phenology of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta using a MODIS vegetation index time series. Additional applications and limitations of Time-Space characterization and mixture modeling are further illustrated by comparing the eigenstructures and temporal feature spaces of Landsat vegetation fraction and DMSP-OLS night light time series.

AB A lack of spatially, structurally and thematically accurate habitat data complicates conservation and management planning as well as ecological research within structurally complex littoral enviromnents. The Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) Survey (SHOALS) has considerable potential to provide such data, by means of its proficiency in generating high-resolution measurements of emerged and immersed elevations and to create thematic maps. Return signals, i.e., waveforms, contain signatures and structural information of salt-marsh and benthic cover. This paper focuses on the capability of the SHOALS to assess the structural complexity of emerged and immersed coastal habitats, and to define the contribution of SHOALS data, both elevation and intensity, in order to accurately and seamlessly map these habitats from supratidal to nearshore levels. The study area was selected based upon the variety of littoral cover types, encompassing kelp habitat, eelgrass meadow, beach, salt-marsh, farm and urban coastal environments. Firstly, the LiDAR-derived green waveform, through an ad hoc decision-tree, satisfactorily assessed the structural complexity of littoral habitats (r = 0.75, p<0.01). Secondly, synergistic combination between NDLVI (LiDAR-derived red and near-infrared data) and topographic/bathymetric surfaces (LiDAR-derived near-infrared and green, respectively) enabled the accurate mapping of 19 littoral habitats (overall accuracy and kappa coefficient equaled to 90.09% and 0.8883, respectively). Accordingly, a single multispectral (three bands) LiDAR survey holds significant potential for monitoring small-scale structural complexity, as well as constructing spatially and temporally seamless patterns of coastal habitats.

AB Daily values of gross primary production (GPP) derived from an eddy-covariance flux tower have been used to analyze the information content of the MODIS Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) on the light-use efficiency (epsilon). The study has been conducted in a Mediterranean Pinus pinaster forest showing summer water stress. Advanced processing techniques have been used to analyze the effect of various external factors on c and PRI temporal variations. The intra-annual correlation between these two variables has been found to be mostly attributable to concurrent variations in sun and view zenith angles. The PRI has been normalized from these angular effects (NPRI), and its ability to track ecosystem c response to prolonged summer water limitations has been analyzed. The observed shift between E and NPRI reveals that, for the study area and at MODIS spatial resolution, NPRI is informative on changes in pigments and canopy structure related to the vegetation response to prolonged water stress.

AB An improved automatic detection of mesoscale frontal activity is proposed, based on the edge detection algorithm initially presented by Cayula and Cornillon (1992). The performance and the sensitivity of their original method have been extensively tested on a very large MODIS SST data set at 1 km resolution, over the Canary Upwelling System, and compared to the results of a classic gradient based method. Its evaluation, including the companion method using a contour-following algorithm, shows that a significant part of the fronts was not detected by the earlier method despite an overall robustness.
   We propose here an improved implementation of the single image edge detection algorithm, from the best combination of multiple detections based on sliding windows (referred to as CMW). The results show a very significant increase of the overall performance: using a time series of 6 years (1,988 images), we observed an average increase of 140% in the edge detection and 30% improvement in the average length of the segments. Additionally, the sensitivity to the size of the detection window is lower, and the necessity of using the "following algorithm" is greatly reduced.
   We applied the CMW improvements to the Canary Current System, and showed frontal activity developed along the whole coast, with more intense fronts between Cape Ghir (30 degrees 30' N) and Cape Beddouza (32 degrees 30' N), and between Cape Juby (28 degrees N) and Cape Bojador (26 degrees 30' N). The highest filament activity was associated with Cape Bojador followed by Cape Ghir and Cape Blanco (21 degrees N). Considering the seasonality, two main areas were identified, north and south of Cape Juby, with marked seasonality in the fronts and filaments. No major interannual differences in frontal activity were observed in 2002-2007, except less seasonality during 2007. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Identification of "ever-cropped" land (1984-2010) using Landsat annual

AB A time series of 230 intra- and inter-annual Landsat Thematic Mapper images was used to identify land that was ever cropped during the years 1984 through 2010 for a five county region in southwestern Kansas. Annual maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) image composites (NDVIann-max) were used to evaluate the inter-annual dynamics of cropped and non-cropped land. Three feature images were derived from the 27-year NDVIann-max image time series and used in the classification: 1) maximum NDVI value that occurred over the entire 27 year time span (NDVImax), 2) standard deviation of the annual maximum NDVI values for all years (NDVIsd), and 3) standard deviation of the annual maximum NDVI values for years 1984-1986 (NDVIsd84-86) to improve Conservation Reserve Program land discrimination.
   Results of the classification were compared to three reference data sets: County-level USDA Census records (1982-2007) and two digital land cover maps (Kansas 2005 and USGS Trends Program maps (1986-2000)). Area of ever-cropped land for the five counties was on average 11.8% higher than the area estimated from Census records. Overall agreement between the ever-cropped land map and the 2005 Kansas map was 91.9% and 97.2% for the Trends maps. Converting the intra-annual Landsat data set to a single annual maximum NDVI image composite considerably reduced the data set size, eliminated clouds and cloud-shadow affects, yet maintained information important for discriminating cropped land. Our results suggest that Landsat annual maximum NDVI image composites will be useful for characterizing land use and land cover change for many applications. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI Evaluation of the predicted error of the soil moisture retrieval from
   C-band SAR by comparison against modelled soil moisture estimates over
   Australia

AB The Sentinel-1 will carry onboard a C-band radar instrument that will map the European continent once every four days and the global land surface at least once every twelve days with finest 5 x 20 m spatial resolution. The high temporal sampling rate and operational configuration make Sentinel-1 of interest for operational soil moisture monitoring. Currently, updated soil moisture data are made available at 1 km spatial resolution as a demonstration service using Global Mode (GM) measurements from the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) onboard ENVISAT. The service demonstrates the potential of the C-band observations to monitor variations in soil moisture. Importantly, a retrieval error estimate is also available; these are needed to assimilate observations into models. The retrieval error is estimated by propagating sensor errors through the retrieval model.
   In this work, the existing ASAR GM retrieval error product is evaluated using independent top soil moisture estimates produced by the grid-based landscape hydrological model (AWRA-L) developed within the Australian Water Resources Assessment system (AWRA). The ASAR GM retrieval error estimate, an assumed prior AWRA-L error estimate and the variance in the respective datasets were used to spatially predict the root mean square error (RMSE) and the Pearson's correlation coefficient R between the two datasets. These were compared with the RMSE calculated directly from the two datasets. The predicted and computed RMSE showed a very high level of agreement in spatial patterns as well as good quantitative agreement; the RMSE was predicted within accuracy of 4% of saturated soil moisture over 89% of the Australian land mass. Predicted and calculated R maps corresponded within accuracy of 10% over 61% of the continent. The strong correspondence between the predicted and calculated RMSE and R builds confidence in the retrieval error model and derived ASAR GM error estimates.
   The ASAR GM and Sentinel-1 have the same basic physical measurement characteristics, and therefore very similar retrieval error estimation method can be applied. Because of the expected improvements in radiometric resolution of the Sentinel-1 backscatter measurements, soil moisture estimation errors can be expected to be an order of magnitude less than those for ASAR GM. This opens the possibility for operationally available medium resolution soil moisture estimates with very well-specified errors that can be assimilated into hydrological or crop yield models, with potentially large benefits for land-atmosphere fluxes, crop growth, and water balance monitoring and modelling.

AB We present a method based on space-borne optical imagery from the SPOT5 satellite to directly measure the phase velocity fields of ocean waves. The panchromatic and multispectral scenes acquired by SPOTS the same day on the same area are not strictly superimposable due to the different locations of the CCDs (Charged Coupled Device) in the focal plane of the instrument. In this manuscript, we propose a method that exploits the temporal lag that exists between the panchromatic and multispectral scenes to measure the ocean wave velocity fields. We firstly discuss the principle and the methodology. Then, we apply it offshore La Reunion Island. Finally, we compare and discuss the results against a swell propagation model. Our method is proven reliable and can be immediately extended to other push-broom sensors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying suitable habitat is critical to endangered species management and recovery. However, this basic task is often complicated by the rarity of the species in question and the limited availability of high quality environmental data. The endangered Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla) occupies early seral shrub communities generated by fire. The ability to predict vegetation structure is particularly important for mapping vireo habitat because this species occupies transitional, non-equilibrium vegetation types. We use presence data for territorial male vireos collected throughout the Fort Hood Military Reservation, Texas, to construct habitat suitability models using vegetation type (mapped from aerial imagery), soil data, and laser altimetry (LiDAR)-derived measures of vegetation structure. LiDAR produces a three-dimensional, high-resolution representation of vegetation structure across broad spatial scales. We built models that incorporated LIDAR outputs as well as the other habitat predictors using a non-parametric machine-learning algorithm, cforest. Models built using a single predictor class (vegetation structure or type or soil) performed similarly across 25 bootstrapped training and test datasets (median accuracies 76%, 74%, and 79%, respectively). Models incorporating two predictor classes performed better (80-81%) and only slightly worse than the full model (82%). Furthermore, vegetation type and soil data were more important predictors of habitat suitability than structural measures in the full model. Predictive maps suggest that models incorporating vegetation type and soil would be most useful for habitat conservation and management applications on Fort Hood. The addition of LiDAR-derived variables to the model further distinguishes suitable habitats from potentially suitable but presently overgrown areas. In the absence of detailed vegetation data, models based on structural measures performed well when combined with soil data. This could be useful in a broader regional context in which vireos occupy a greater variety of vegetation types with a common structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Impervious surface quantification is important for many planning and management applications because of the impacts that impervious surfaces have on a range of environmental resources such as groundwater. This research proposes an integrated method to quantify impervious surfaces at multiple spatial scales via a synthesis of several machine learning approaches. In this study, we 1) proposed a hierarchical classification method to detect impervious surfaces through a fusion of optimized artificial immune networks (OPTINC) and decision trees at high spatial resolution, 2) evaluated the method using multi-sensor data (i.e., high spatial resolution WorldView-2 and LiDAR data) to map impervious surfaces, 3) tested the applicability of the binary impervious surface maps to quantify sub-pixel imperviousness from Landsat TM data of a larger region using regression trees at moderate spatial resolution, and 4) examined the model sensitivity of regression trees to training sample size for impervious surface quantification. OPTINC and decision trees successfully identified impervious surfaces at high resolution (overall accuracy>90%). The regression tree predicted imperviousness from the TM data with a moderate success (R-2=0.64 and MAE=14.2%). Although the regression tree appeared robust when training sample size was sufficiently large, it was not stable with small sample size (e.g., <100). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Gas flaring monitoring from space using the ATSR instrument series
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID WORLD
AB Gas flaring flames are characterised by high temperatures and ATSR instruments are equipped with the appropriate spectral bands to detect them. In order to monitor gas flaring on global scale a new active flame detection scheme from satellite night-time Short Wavelength Infra Red measurements (SWIR, 1.6 mu m) has been developed and tested using the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) family measurements. The new algorithm, called ALGO3, is based on the verified assumption that, at SWIR wavelengths, the background contribution to the night-time total radiation measured by ATSR is negligible, while that emitted by active flames is fully detectable. ALGO3 products are suitable for detecting gas flares, due to their peculiar high temperature/small area flames. Flaring sites have been discriminated according to time persistency criteria, i.e. location for which hot spots are found at frequencies higher than 4 times a year are assumed to be industrial settlements. Continuity and consistency between the ATSR missions has been verified, and results relative to 1991-2009 time window are reported. Validation of flaring site discrimination has been performed by visual inspection of high resolution Earth surface images. The comparison of ALGO3 retrievals with light count data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) show very good agreement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper evaluates the ability of small footprint, multiple return and pulsed airborne scanner data to classify tree genera hierarchically using stepwise cluster analysis. Leaf-on and leaf-off airborne scanner datasets obtained in the Washington Park Arboretum, Seattle, Washington, USA were used for tree genera classification. Parameters derived from structure and intensity data from the leaf-on and leaf-off laser scanning datasets were compared to ground truth data. Relative height percentiles and simple crown shapes using the ratio of a crown length to width were computed for the structure variables. Selected structure variables from the leaf-on dataset had higher classification rate (74.9%) than those from the leaf-off dataset (50.2%) for distinguishing deciduous from coniferous genera using linear discriminant functions.
   Unsupervised stepwise cluster analysis was conducted to find groupings of similar genera at consecutive steps using k-medoid algorithm. The three stepwise cluster analyses using different seasonal laser scanning datasets resulted in different outcomes, which imply that genera might be grouped differently depending on the timing of the data collection. When combining leaf-on and leaf-off LIDAR datasets, the cluster analysis could separate the deciduous genera from evergreen coniferous genera and could make further separations between evergreen coniferous genera When using the leaf-on LIDAR dataset only, the cluster analysis did not separate deciduous from evergreen genera The overall results indicate the importance of the timing of laser scanner data acquisition for tree genera separation and suggest that the potential of combining two LIDAR datasets for improved classification.

AB This paper considers the uncertainties that arise in estimating the concentration of suspended minerals by optical remote sensing in waters which contain unknown concentrations of other optically significant constituents. Relationships between suspended mineral concentrations and remote sensing reflectance were calculated by radiative transfer modelling using representative specific inherent optical properties (SIOPs) for phytoplankton (CHL), suspended mineral particles of terrigenous origin (MSSter) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) that were derived from measurements at 173 stations in UK shelf seas. When only suspended minerals were present, remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) was related to MSSter, by a family of saturation curves whose shape depended strongly on wavelength. However the addition of CHL and CDOM made this relationship considerably more complex. Polynomial expressions were therefore derived for the maximum and minimum values of MMSter consistent with a given R(rs)667 in the presence of independently varying concentrations of CHL and CDOM. For CHL ranging from 0 to 10 mg m(-3) and CDOM from 0 to 1 m(-1), for example, an R(rs)667 observation 0.01 sr(-1) could corresponded to MSSter values between 7 and 12 g m(-3). The presence of biogenic minerals in the form of diatom frustules. MSSdia, had little influence on the accuracy of MSSter retrieval. The degree of variability in the relationship between MSSter and Rrs667 predicted by the model was confirmed by measurements of radiometric profiles and mineral concentrations at 110 Irish Sea stations. Uncertainties in the remote sensing of MSSter in coastal waters are more appropriately indicated by upper and lower limits set according to the likely ranges of other optically significant constituents than by percentage errors. Moreover, the influence of these constituents should be eliminated before variations in the relationship between MSSter and Rrs are attributed to qualitative changes in mineral particle characteristics.

AB The Joint Research Centre Two-stream Inversion Package (JRC-TIP) makes use of white sky albedo products-derived from MODIS and MISR observations in the visible and near-infrared domain-to deliver consistent sets of information about the terrestrial environments that gave rise to these data. The baseline version of the JRC-TIP operates at a spatial resolution of 0.01 degrees and yields estimates of the Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) of the effective canopy Leaf Area Index (LAI), the canopy background albedo, the vegetation scattering properties, as well as, the absorbed, reflected and transmitted fluxes of the vegetation canopy. In this contribution the evaluation efforts of the JRC-TIP products are extended to the deciduous forest site of Hainich (Germany) where multiannual datasets of in-situ estimates of canopy transmission-derived from LAI-2000 observations-are available. As a Fluxnet site, Hainich offers access to camera acquisitions from fixed locations in and above the canopy that are being used in phenological studies. These images qualitatively confirm the seasonal patterns of the effective LAI, canopy transmission and canopy absorption products (in the visible range of the solar spectrum) derived with the JRC-TIP. Making use of the LAI-2000 observations it is found that 3/4 of the JRC-TIP products lie within a +/- 0.15 interval around the in-situ estimates of canopy transmission and absorption. The largest discrepancies occur at the end of the senescence phase when the scattering properties of the vegetation (evidenced by the pictures) and the images qualitatively confirm the seasonal patterns of the effective LAI, canopy transmission and canopy absorption products (in the visible range of the solar spectrum) derived with the JRC-TIP. Making use of the LAI-2000 observations it is found that 3/4 of the JRC-TIP products lie within a +/- 0.15 interval around the in-situ estimates of canopy transmission and absorption. The largest discrepancies occur at the end of the senescence phase when the scattering properties of the vegetation (evidenced by the pictures) and the effective LAI (also derived from LAI-2000 measurements) are experiencing large simultaneous changes. It was also found that the seasonal pattern of vegetation scattering properties derived from MISR observations in the near-infrared varies together with the Excess Green index computed from the various channels of the camera data acquired at the top of the canopy.

AB Canopy phenology is an important factor driving seasonal patterns of water and carbon exchange between land surface and atmosphere. Recent developments of real-time global satellite products (e.g., MOD'S) provide the potential to assimilate dynamic canopy measurements with spatially distributed process-based ecohydrological models. However, global satellite products usually are provided with relatively coarse spatial resolutions, averaging out important spatial heterogeneity of both terrain and vegetation. Therefore, bias can result from lumped representation of ecological and hydrological processes especially in topographically complex terrain. Successful downscaling of canopy phenology to high spatial resolution would be indispensable for catchment-scale distributed ecohydrological modeling, aiming at understanding complex patterns of water, carbon and nutrient cycling in mountainous watersheds. Two downscaling approaches are developed in this study to overcome this issue by fusing multi-temporal MODIS and Landsat TM data in conjunction with topographic information to estimate high spatio-temporal resolution biophysical parameters over complex terrain. MODIS FPAR (fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) is used to provide medium spatial resolution phenology, while the variability of vegetation within a MODIS pixel is characterized by Landsat NDVI. The algorithms depend on the scale-invariant linear relationship between FPAR and NDVI, which is verified in this study. Downscaled vegetation dynamics are successfully validated both temporally and spatially with ground-based continuous FPAR and leaf area index measurements. Topographic correction during the downscaling process has a limited effect on downscaled FPAR products except for the period around the winter solstice in the study area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB The use of remote sensing is necessary for monitoring forest carbon stocks at large scales. Optical remote sensing, although not the most suitable technique for the direct estimation of stand biomass, offers the advantage of providing large temporal and spatial datasets. In particular, information on canopy structure is encompassed in stand reflectance time series. This study focused on the example of Eucalyptus forest plantations, which have recently attracted much attention as a result of their high expansion rate in many tropical countries. Stand scale time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were obtained from MODIS satellite data after a procedure involving un-mixing and interpolation, on about 15,000 ha of plantations in southern Brazil. The comparison of the planting date of the current rotation (and therefore the age of the stands) estimated from these time series with real values provided by the company showed that the root mean square error was 35.5 days. Age alone explained more than 82% of stand wood volume variability and 87% of stand dominant height variability. Age variables were combined with other variables derived from the NDVI time series and simple bioclimatic data by means of linear (Stepwise) or nonlinear (Random Forest) regressions. The nonlinear regressions gave r-square values of 0.90 for volume and 0.92 for dominant height, and an accuracy of about 25 m(3)/ha for volume (15% of the volume average value) and about 1.6 m for dominant height (8% of the height average value). The improvement including NDVI and bioclimatic data comes from the fact that the cumulative NDVI since planting date integrates the interannual variability of leaf area index (LAI), light interception by the foliage and growth due for example to variations of seasonal water stress. The accuracy of biomass and height predictions was strongly improved by using the NDVI integrated over the two first years after planting, which are critical for stand establishment. These results open perspectives for cost-effective monitoring of biomass at large scales in intensively-managed plantation forests. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Leaf spectroscopy may be useful for tropical species discrimination, but few studies have provided an understanding of the spectral separability of species or how leaf spectroscopy scales to the canopy level relevant to mapping. Here we report on a study to classify humid tropical forest canopy species using field-measured leaf optical properties with leaf and canopy radiative transfer models. The experimental dataset included 188 canopy species collected in humid tropical forests of Hawaii. The leaf optical model PROSPECT-5 was used to simulate the leaf spectra of each species, which was used to train a classifier based on Linear Discriminant Analysis, and a canopy radiative transfer model 4SAIL2 to scale leaf measurements to the canopy level. The relationship linking classification accuracy at the leaf level to biodiversity showed an asymptotic trend reaching a maximum error of 47% when applied to the entire 188 species experimental dataset, and 56% when a simulated dataset showing amplified within-species spectral variability was used, suggesting uniqueness of the spectral signature for a significant proportion of species under study. The maximum error in canopy-level species classification was higher than leaf-level classification: 55% when canopy structure was held constant, and 64% with varying and unknown canopy structure. However, when classifying fewer species at a time, errors dropped considerably; for example, 20 species can be classified to 82-88% accuracy. These results highlight the potential of imaging spectroscopy to provide species discrimination in high-diversity, humid tropical forests. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The optical properties of aerosol have been simultaneously retrieved over the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China during December 2009 from multi-angular, multi-spectral, and polarized airborne data. A new airborne Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) with high spatial resolution (4 m at 4000 m a.g.l.) is used to retrieve the aerosol optical properties, which is an experimental airborne instrument focused on monitoring aerosol particle pollution, dealing with the apportionment of sources and controlling air quality in cities. We present a case study of polarized observations performed during high air pollution episodes in the southeast of China. Exceptionally high values of the aerosol optical depth of up to 0.8 (at 0.865 mu m) were observed in this case study. The spatial and temporal variability of aerosol optical properties over the Pearl River Delta region were analyzed using polarized measurements with high spatial resolution. To reduce the ambiguity in retrieving aerosol optical properties using DPC alone, ground-based measurements (Automatic CE318-DP polarized sun-sky radiometer, Raman Lidar) were used to constrain the inversion in terms of the key characteristics of a local aerosol model, including spectral complex refractive index, size distribution, and vertical distribution of aerosol optical parameters. The surface contribution to the polarized radiance was simulated using bidirectional polarized reflectance distribution function (BPDF), which was adjusted using DPC measurements at low altitude. The aerosol optical properties were retrieved using DPC over the Pearl River Delta, and are in good agreement with coincident sun photometer retrievals. The retrieval algorithm of aerosol optical properties using high spatial resolution polarized measurements proposed in this paper shows potential to retrieve the aerosol optical properties over cities.

AB Most space-borne sensors cannot detect subsurface features. Groundwater is a typical subsurface feature, and its discharge to coastal ocean waters plays an important role in transporting terrestrial chemical constituents and providing habitats for various species of fauna and flora. This is the first paper to report observational evidence for submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) in tidal flats using space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Tidal flats are composed of high-moisture-saturated sediments and water puddles. These shallow water puddles were imaged effectively by using SAR systems. The presence of water puddles is usually indicated by low radar backscatter in SAR images due to specular reflections on the water surface. This effect was proved by comparing radar backscattering coefficients obtained from two space-borne SAR systems, TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2, with those obtained from two theoretical scattering models, IEM and Oh model. We observed relatively large, widely distributed water puddles in belt shape along the upper parts of the tidal flat, which were confirmed to be related to the discharge of groundwater. The results of this research suggest that SAR can be a powerful tool for observing and determining the areal distributions of possible groundwater discharge in large tidal flats, which is normally difficult to detect with traditional measurement tools or survey techniques for groundwater discharge. We firmly believe that this technique can reduce significantly the efforts of field work to confirm SGD in tidal flats. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The scientific method has been characterized as having two distinct components, Discovery and Justification. Discovery emphasizes ideas and creativity, focuses on conceiving hypotheses and constructing models, and is generally regarded as lacking a formal logic. justification begins with the hypotheses and models and ends with a valid scientific inference. Unlike Discovery, justification has a formal logic whose rules must be rigorously followed to produce valid scientific inferences. In particular, when inferences are based on sample data, the rules of the logic of justification require assessments of bias and precision. Thus, satellite image-based maps that lack such assessments for parameters of populations depicted by the maps may be of little utility for scientific inference: essentially, they may be just pretty pictures. Probability- and model-based approaches are explained, illustrated, and compared for producing inferences for population parameters using a map depicting three land cover classes: non-forest, coniferous forest, and deciduous forest. The maps were constructed using forest inventory data and Landsat imagery. Although a multinomial logistic regression model was used to classify the imagery, the methods for assessing bias and precision can be used with any classification method. For probability-based approaches, the difference estimator was used, and for model-based inference, a bootstrap approach was used. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Practical and financial constraints associated with traditional field-based lithological mapping are often responsible for the generation of maps with insufficient detail and inaccurately located contacts. In arid areas with well exposed rocks and soils, high-resolution multi- and hyperspectral imagery is a valuable mapping aid as lithological units can be readily discriminated and mapped by automatically matching image pixel spectra to a set of reference spectra. However, the use of spectral imagery in all but the most barren terrain is problematic because just small amounts of vegetation cover can obscure or mask the spectra of underlying geological substrates. The use of ancillary information may help to improve lithological discrimination, especially where geobotanical relationships are absent or where distinct lithologies exhibit inherent spectral similarity. This study assesses the efficacy of airborne multispectral imagery for detailed lithological mapping in a vegetated section of the Troodos ophiolite (Cyprus), and investigates whether the mapping performance can be enhanced through the integration of LiDAR-derived topographic data. In each case, a number of algorithms involving different combinations of input variables and classification routine were employed to maximise the mapping performance. Despite the potential problems posed by vegetation cover, geobotanical associations aided the generation of a lithological map - with a satisfactory overall accuracy of 65.5% and Kappa of 0.54 - using only spectral information. Moreover, owing to the correlation between topography and lithology in the study area, the integration of LiDAR-derived topographic variables led to significant improvements of up to 22.5% in the overall mapping accuracy compared to spectral-only approaches. The improvements were found to be considerably greater for algorithms involving classification with an artificial neural network (the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map) than the parametric Maximum Likelihood Classifier. The results of this study demonstrate the enhanced capability of data integration for detailed lithological mapping in areas where spectral discrimination is complicated by the presence of vegetation or inherent spectral similarities.

AB Most of the operational Sea Surface Temperature (SST) products derived from satellite infrared radiometry use multi-spectral algorithms. They show, in general, reasonable performances with root mean square (RMS) residuals around 0.5 K when validated against buoy measurements, but have limitations, particularly a component of the retrieval error that relates to such algorithms' limited ability to cope with the full variability of atmospheric absorption and emission. We propose to use forecast atmospheric profiles and a radiative transfer model to simulate the algorithmic errors of multi-spectral algorithms. In the practical case of SST derived from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), we demonstrate that simulated algorithmic errors do explain a significant component of the actual errors observed for the non linear (NL) split window algorithm in operational use at the Centre de Meteorologie Spatiale (CMS). The simulated errors, used as correction terms, reduce significantly the regional biases of the NL algorithm as well as the standard deviation of the differences with drifting buoy measurements. The availability of atmospheric profiles associated with observed satellite-buoy differences allows us to analyze the origins of the main algorithmic errors observed in the SEVIRI field of view: a negative bias in the inter-tropical zone, and a mid-latitude positive bias. We demonstrate how these errors are explained by the sensitivity of observed brightness temperatures to the vertical distribution of water vapour, propagated through the SST retrieval algorithm.

AB The amount of water stored and moving through the Amazon floodplain is not known, yet is necessary for understanding the role of the wetland in the regional carbon balance and the sediment and nutrient exchanged with the main river channel. Here, we separate the Amazon floodplain into six 330 km x 330 km areas and use gravimetric and imaging satellite methods (i.e., GRACE, SRTM, GPCP and JERS-1) to estimate the amounts of water filling and draining from the mainstem Amazon floodplain. We show that the amount of water stored on and subsequently drained from the mainstem Amazon floodplain each year represents about 5% of the total volume of water discharged from the Amazon River into the Atlantic Ocean. Despite a five-fold increase in mainstem discharge from upstream to downstream, the floodplain water volume exchanged with the river only doubles (based on all six 330 km reach lengths). Rates of exchange along the 330 km reach lengths vary from 5500 m(3)/s during floodplain infilling to -7500 m(3)/s during drainage. The contribution to the floodplain from local upland runoff represents less than 20% of the floodplain water volume for any given time. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Variations in agricultural production due to rainfall and temperature fluctuations are a primary cause of food insecurity on the African continent. Analysis of changes in phenology can provide quantitative information on the effect of climate variability on growing seasons in agricultural regions. Using a robust statistical methodology, we describe the relationship between phenology metrics derived from the 26 year AVHRR NDVI record and the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI). We map the most significant positive and negative correlation for the four climate indices in Eastern, Western and Southern Africa between two phenological metrics and the climate indices. Our objective is to provide evidence of whether climate variability captured in the four indices has had a significant impact on the vegetative productivity of Africa during the past quarter century. We found that the start of season and cumulative NDVI were significantly affected by large scale variations in climate. The particular climate index and the timing showing highest correlation depended heavily on the region examined. In Western Africa the cumulative NDVI correlates with PDO in September-November. In Eastern Africa the start of the June-October season strongly correlates with PDO in March-May, while the PDO in December-February correlates with the start of the February-June season. The cumulative NDVI over this last season relates to the MEI of March-May. For Southern Africa, high correlations exist between SOS and NAO of September-November, and cumulative NDVI and MEI of March-May. The research shows that climate indices can be used to anticipate late start and variable vigor in the growing season of sensitive agricultural regions in Africa. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We compare the performances of two widely used hemispheric scale snow products during April. May, and June over North America. The Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), based primarily on optical-band remotely sensed images, is the latest incarnation of a product that dates back to the 1960s and has been used as input to operational weather forecasting models as well as for establishing the historical climatology of snow extent over land surfaces. NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) has been used for numerous applications since It was launched aboard the Terra satellite platform in 1999 The MODIS snow product is based primarily on optical-band reflectances. We include in our analysis only observations that are largely unobstructed by clouds as determined using the MODIS cloud detection algorithm Then, after removing the influences of terrain and projection errors, we identify regions and land surface types where discrepancies between these two products occur. We also compare IMS and MODIS to the snow reanalysis produced by the Canadian Meteorological Center (CMC). We find that on seasonal time scales, the most pronounced differences between the IMS and MODIS snow products occurs during the ablation season over North America. Our results corroborate earlier studies showing pronounced differences over the northern tundra in June, where MODIS appears to be in agreement with other observations, as well as differences in April and May in the boreal forest, where evidence suggests that both products may be biased (although MODIS biases may be smaller) in comparison with the CMC product (which is based on station observations) The influence of clouds may be a factor even though the analysis includes only clear days. Another possible explanation for these discrepancies Involves the impact of numerous small lakes over the North American landscape on the interpretation of satellite retrievals in the visible band, although there are other potential sources of error in both products For example, comparison to the CMC reanalysis suggests that MODIS may be overestimating snow during the ablation season in the boreal forest The resolution of these discrepancies may affect our understanding of the seasonal snow cover cycle, the evaluation of and development of parameterization schemes for climate models, and the development of a climate data record for snow cover.

AB The challenge to retrieve canopy height from large-footprint satellite lidar waveforms over mountainous areas is formidable given the complex interaction of terrain and vegetation. This study explores the potential of GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) for retrieving maximum canopy height over mountainous areas in the Pacific Coast region, including two conifers sites of tall and closed canopy and one broadleaf woodland site of shorter and sparse canopy. Both direct methods and statistical models are developed and tested using spatially extensive coincident airborne lidar data. The major findings include: 1) the direct methods tend to overestimate the canopy height and are complicated by the identification of waveform signal start and terrain ground elevation, 2) the exploratory data analysis indicates that the edge-extent linear regression models have better generalizability than the edge-extent nonlinear models at the inter-site level, 3) the inter-site level test with mixed-effects models reveals that the edge-extent linear models have statistically-justified generalizability between the two conifer sites but not between the conifer and woodland sites, 4) the intra-site level test indicates that the edge-extent linear models have statistically-justified generalizability across different vegetation community types within any given site; this, combined with 3), unveils that the statistical modeling of maximum canopy height over large areas with edge-extent linear models only need to consider broad vegetation differences (such as woodlands versus conifer forests instead of different vegetation communities within woodlands or conifer forests), and 5) the simulations indicate that the errors and uncertainty in canopy height estimation can be significantly reduced by decreasing the footprint size. It is recommended that the footprint size of the next-generation satellite lidar systems be at least 10 m or so if we want to achieve meter-level accuracy of maximum canopy height estimation using direct and statistical methods.

AB Wheat is one of the key cereal crops grown worldwide, providing the primary caloric and nutritional source for millions of people around the world. In order to ensure food security and sound, actionable mitigation strategies and policies for management of food shortages, timely and accurate estimates of global crop production are essential. This study combines a new BRDF-corrected, daily surface reflectance dataset developed from NASA's Moderate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) with detailed official crop statistics to develop an empirical, generalized approach to forecast wheat yields. The first step of this study was to develop and evaluate a regression-based model for forecasting winter wheat production in Kansas. This regression-based model was then directly applied to forecast winter wheat production in Ukraine. The forecasts of production in Kansas closely matched the USDA/NASS reported numbers with a 7% error. The same regression model forecast winter wheat production in Ukraine within 10% of the official reported production numbers six weeks prior to harvest. Using new data from MODIS, this method is simple, has limited data requirements, and can provide an indication of winter wheat production shortfalls and surplus prior to harvest in regions where minimal ground data is available.

AB Coccolithophores are the largest source of calcium carbonate in the oceans and are considered to play an important role in oceanic Carbon cycles. Current methods to detect the presence of coccolithophore blooms from Earth observation data often produce high numbers of false positives in shelf seas and coastal zones due to the spectral similarity between coccolithophores and other suspended particulates. Current methods are therefore unable to characterise the bloom events in shelf seas and coastal zones, despite the importance of these phytoplankton in the global carbon cycle. A novel approach to detect the presence of coccolithophore blooms from Earth observation data is presented. The method builds upon previous optical work and uses a statistical framework to combine spectral, spatial and temporal information to produce maps of coccolithophore bloom extent. Validation and verification results for an area of the north east Atlantic are presented using an in situ database (N = 432) and all available SeaWiFS data for 2003 and 2004. Verification results show that the approach produces a temporal seasonal signal consistent with biological studies of these phytoplankton. Validation using the in situ coccolithophore cell count database shows a high correct recognition rate of 80% and a low false-positive rate of 0.14 (in comparison to 63% and 0.34 respectively for the established, purely spectral approach). To guide its broader use, a full sensitivity analysis for the algorithm parameters is presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on northern vegetation, particularly along transition zones such as the treeline. Studies of vegetation composition and change in this ecotone have largely focussed on local analysis of individual trees using labour intensive stand reconstruction techniques, which are spatially limited and do not consider vegetation types other than trees. Remote sensing may be well suited to monitoring recent changes across the treeline because it captures integrated changes of all vegetation life forms over large spatial extents. This research examines treeline vegetation composition and change along the western subarctic treeline mapped by Timoney et al. (1992) using a 1 km resolution, 22-year AVHRR archive from 1985-2006. While most remote sensing studies on vegetation change in arctic and subarctic regions only exploit information contained in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), we examine long-term reflectance trends in AVHRR bands 1 and 2 in addition to NDVI. The GeoSail canopy reflectance model is used to map treeline composition by combining information from 22-year summertime and early springtime composite images. A set of spectral change vectors are then generated from GeoSail simulations and used to classify trends in AVHRR along the treeline to estimate vegetation change. Evaluation of vegetation composition against the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) product that has been recently validated along the treeline reveals good spatial correspondence. Temporal trends are shown to agree with literature on tundra-taiga vegetation dynamics in recent decades. Evidence is presented that suggests replacement of bare surfaces with herb, conifer decline along the southern treeline, increased shrubiness, and increased conifer recruitment and growth in the north.

AB The and and semi-arid sagebrush-grass ecosystem occupies a substantial portion of rangelands in the western United States. Using remote sensing techniques to map the percent of sagebrush, grass/forb, and bare ground components is necessary for forage production estimation and natural resource management over large areas. However optical data have significant deficiencies in these ecosystems because of exposed bright soil, spectrally-indeterminate vegetation, and a large dead vegetation component. Radar data also have deficiencies caused by factors such as antenna pattern calibration, local incidence angle (LIA), soil moisture, and surface roughness. With the complementary vegetation information gained from optical data and radar data, these two datasets were fused to estimate 10-m sagebrush, grass, and bare ground percent cover in the non-forested areas of Yellowstone National Park, which is a representative native western rangeland ecosystem of the US. The datasets were processed to resolve the issues of antenna pattern calibration and LIA effect. Peak green Landsat, late fall Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), and Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AirSAR) data were fused in this analysis. AVIRIS, Landsat, AirSAR and elevation data were used to segment the study area into two main subcategories of "pure grass" and "mixed sagebrush and grass". Landsat Tasseled Cap Greenness (LTCG) was used to retrieve bare land and grass percentages in pure grass areas. In the areas with mixed grass and sagebrush, standardized LTCG and radar C-vv were used to derive the vegetation cover percentage, and the ratio of standardized LTCG and radar L-hv was further used to calculate the relative abundance of sagebrush and grass. Comparison between the field and remote sensing estimations shows the correlation coefficients were 0.838, 0.746, and 0.830 for bare land, grass, and sagebrush, respectively. When grouped into three discrete categories of "low", "medium", and "high", the overall accuracies were 79.4%, 75.9%, and 77.6%. respectively. Our study shows the potential for application of global spaceborne C- and L-band radar and optical data fusion for large-area rangeland monitoring. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Data of normalized water-leaving radiance, nLw. obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite at spatial resolution of 250 m (band 1 centered at 645 nm) and 500 m (band 4 at 555 nm) are used to study turbid plumes in coastal waters of southern California during rainstorm events in winter of 2004-2005. Our study area includes San Diego coastal waters, which extend approximately 25 km offshore between Point Loma and 10 km south of the US-Mexican border. These waters are influenced by terrigenous input of particulate and dissolved materials from San Diego and Tijuana watersheds and non-point sources along the shore. Optimum threshold values of satellite-derived normalized water-leaving radiances at both wavebands were established for distinguishing the plume from ambient ocean waters. These threshold values were determined by searching for a maximum correlation between the estimates of satellite-derived plume area calculated using a broad range of nLw values and the environmental variables characterizing rainfall, river discharge, wind. and tides. A correlation analysis involving the amount of precipitated water accumulated during a storm event over the San Diego and Tijuana watersheds was selected as the basis for final determinations of the optimum threshold nLW(thr) and subsequent calculations of the plume area. By applying this method to a sequence of MODIS imagery, we demonstrate the spatial extent and evolution of the plume during rainstorm events under various conditions of precipitation, river discharge, wind forcing, and coastal currents.

AB Heterogeneous heat was applied to a homogenous soil surface to simulate a natural fire event. Subsequently cooled soil samples were evaluated spectrally and a spectral-spatial cube was generated corresponding to the burned area. Heat-induced spectral changes associated with thermal effects on soil minerals were observed across the entire spectrum, including: soil color changes (iron-oxide transformation); shifting absorption bands (iron-oxide transformation and illite/calcite ratio); changes in spectral shape (illite/montmorillonite ratio): disappearing absorption features (unknown); and changes in the overall brightness (soot). A model was developed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) to predict maximum soil surface temperatures, measured using thermocouples, from soil spectral reflectance. Thus, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that soil spectroscopy reveals important information about soil temperature history and as such, represents a promising tool for viewing fire events retrospectively.

AB Wind disturbance events can impact spatially heterogeneous patterns in vegetation structure and disturbance severity in forested landscapes. Characterizing these patterns in forested ecosystems with remote sensing data has been a persistent challenge as variation in severity may be heterogeneous at fine spatial scales. Yet the degree and pattern of disturbance severity are an important influence on successional dynamics. This study explored how spectral and textural characteristics of high-spatial resolution IKONOS imagery reflected patterns of disturbance severity across a windstorm damaged, 121-km(2) area of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) in northeastern Minnesota, USA. In this study, spectral and spatial features of high-spatial resolution (1-m panchromatic and 4-m multispectral) IKONOS satellite imagery from a single post-disturbance date are coupled with field observations of disturbance within 0.045-ha field plots to access the potential for empirically modeling disturbance severity across this heterogeneous landscape within the BWCAW. Combining textural and spectral features led to a multiple regression model that explained 68% of the variance, and predicted disturbance severity equally well for ground data not included in the model development. The results suggest the utility of combining spatial and spectral data for detecting differences in forest structure caused by ecological processes such as disturbance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB The technique of Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was used for estimation of Leaf Area Index (LAI) from remote sensing-based multi-spectral vegetation indices (VI) such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the mid-infrared corrected Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIc), Simple Ratio (SR), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Reduced Simple Ratio (RSR) in a region of equatorial rainforest in Central Sulavesi, Indonesia. The linear regressions between NDVI, NDVIc, SR, SAVI and RSR as explanatory variables and ground measurements of LAI at 166 plots as a dependent variable were produced using common modelling approach - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression fitted to all data points, as well as GWR. Accuracy and precision statistics indicate that the GWR method made significantly better predictions of LAI in all simulations than OLS did. The relationships between LAI and the explanatory variables were found to be significantly spatially variable and scale-dependent. GWR has the potential to reveal local patterns in the spatial distribution of parameter estimates. it demonstrated sensitivity of the model's accuracy and performance to scale variation. The GWR approach enables finding the most appropriate scale for data analysis. This scale was different for each VI. The results suggest that spatial non-stationarity and scale-dependency in the relationship between LAI and remote sensing data has important implications for estimations of LAI based on empirical transfer functions.

ID RULE-BASED CLASSIFICATION; RANDOM FORESTS; NO-TILL; IMAGERY
AB We used an object-oriented approach in conjunction with the Random Forest algorithm to classify agricultural practices, including tillage (till or no-till (NT)), crop intensity, and grassland-based conservation reserve (CR). The object-oriented approach allowed for per-field classifications and the incorporation of contextual elements in addition to spectral features. Random Forest is a classification tree-based advanced classifier that avoids data over-fitting associated with many tree-based models and incorporates an unbiased internal classification accuracy assessment. Landsat satellite imagery was chosen for its continuous coverage, cost effectiveness, and image accessibility. Classification results for 2007 included producer's accuracies of 91% for NT and 31% for tillage when applying Random Forest to image objects generated from a May Landsat image. Low classification accuracies likely were attributed to the misclassification of conservation-based tillage practices as NT. Results showed that the binary separation of tillage from NT management is likely not appropriate due to surface spectral and textural similarities between NT and conservation-type tillage practices. Crop and CR lands resulted in producer's accuracies of 100% and 90%, respectively. Crop and fallow producer's accuracies were 95% and 82% in the 2007 classification, despite post-senesced vegetation; misclassification within the fallow class was attributed to pixel-mixing problems in areas of narrow (<100 m) strip management. A between-date normalized difference vegetation index approach was successfully used to detect areas having "changed" in vegetation status between the 2007 and prior image dates; classified "changed" objects were then merged with "unchanged" objects to produce crop status maps. Field crop intensity was then determined from the multi-year analysis of generated crop status maps. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies show that an atmospheric correction algorithm using shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands improves satellite-derived ocean color products in turbid coastal waters. In this paper, the black pixel assumption (i.e., zero water-leaving radiance contribution) over the ocean for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SWIR bands at 1240, 1640, and 2130 run is assessed for various coastal ocean regions. The black pixel assumption is found to be generally valid with the MODIS SWIR bands at 1640 and 2130 nm even for extremely turbid waters. For the MODIS 1240 nm band, however, ocean radiance contribution is generally negligible in mildly turbid waters such as regions along the U.S. east coast, while some slight radiance contributions are observed in extremely turbid waters, e.g., some regions along the China east coast, the estuary of the La Plata River. Particularly, in the Hangzhou Bay, the ocean radiance contribution at the SWIR band 1240 mn results in an overcorrection of atmospheric and surface effects, leading to errors of MODIS-derived normalized water-leaving radiance at the blue reaching similar to 0.5 MW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1). In addition, we found that, for non-extremely turbid waters, i.e., the ocean contribution at the near-infrared (NIR) band <similar to 1.0 mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1), there exists a good relationship in the regional normalized water-leaving radiances between the red and the NIR bands. Thus, for non-extremely turbid waters, such a red-NIR radiance relationship derived regionally can possibly be used for making corrections for the regional NIR ocean contributions without using the SWIR bands, e.g., for atmospheric correction of ocean color products derived from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS).

AB We analyze the capability of Hyperion spaceborne hyperspectral data for discriminating land cover in a complex natural ecosystem according to the structure of the currently used European standard classification system (CORINE Land Cover 2000). For this purpose, we used Hyperion imagery acquired over Pollino National Park (Italy).
   Hyperion pre-processed data (30 m spatial resolution) were classified at the pixel level using common parametric supervised classification methods. The algorithms' performance and class level accuracy were compared with those obtained for the same area using airborne hyperspectral MIVIS data (7 m spatial resolution).
   Moreover, in selected test areas characterized by heterogeneous land cover (as mapped by MIVIS classification) a Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) technique was applied to Hyperion data to derive the abundance fractions of land cover endmembers. The accuracy of the LSU analysis was evaluated using the Residual Error parameter, by comparing Hyperion LSU results with land cover fractional abundances achieved from reference data (i.e., MIVIS and air-photo classification).
   The results show the potential of Hyperion spaceborne hyperspectral imagery in mapping land cover and vegetation diversity up to the 4th level of the CORINE legend, even at the sub-pixel level, within a fragmented ecosystem such as that of Pollino National Park. Moreover, we defined a criterion for evaluating the Hyperion accuracy in retrieving land cover abundances at the sub-pixel scale. Sub-pixel analysis allowed us to determine the optimal threshold to select the areas on which consistent fractional land cover monitoring can be achieved using the Hyperion sensor.

AB Earth's and and semiarid ecosystems are subject to novel combinations of disruptive factors and unprecedented rates of change. Biotic soil crust is believed to be sensitive to impacts caused by land use and climate changes. This study examined the potential for spectral detection of different biological soil crusts (BSC: cyanobacteria, moss and lichen) and bare soil components at a long-term manipulative experiment at the Mojave Global Change Facility (MGCF) in southwestern Nevada. We evaluated the potential for spectral detection of experimental treatments using laboratory and field measured reflectance spectra in the second and third year of the experiment, and airborne hyperspectral data obtained in the third year of the manipulations for soil disturbance. increased summer rainfall, and dry nitrogen deposition. Laboratory spectra of individual components of biological soil crust and bare soil measured under controlled laboratory conditions were spectrally different over much of the spectrum and exhibited features at 0.42, 0.50, and 0.68 mu m, which could differentiate these materials. Field measured spectra were more similar in overall shape in each of the MGCF treatments and individual BSC could not be distinguished. The held spectra most closely resemble cyanobacteria from laboratory measurements, which are known to cover up to 60% of the inter-shrub spaces. There were significant treatment differences between control, soil disturbance. and irrigation treatments in field spectral measurements and a spectral feature in the 2.00-2.08 mu m region could distinguish these treatments. The treatments were also apparent in high spatial resolution (similar to 4 m ground IFOV) airborne hyperspectral imagery using a minimum noise fraction (MNF) analysis, although treatments were not distinct in terms of laboratory or field-based specific features. Disturbance treatments were easily apparent in color-infrared imagery although other treatments were not distinguished. Three-band composites from a MNF analysis and classification images of the six most significant MNF bands for treatment differences, revealed disturbed and irrigation treatments and combinations of these with nitrogen treatments can be observed but control treatments were not separated from the untreated background. Nitrogen treatments were generally not significantly different from controls unless combined with irrigation or disturbance treatments. These data suggest that hyperspectral imagery could be used to monitor local and perhaps regional changes in biological soil crust in the southwestern deserts of the United States, even if crust components are not individually detected.

AB Estuaries are among the most invaded ecosystems on the planet. Such invasions have led in part, to the formation of a massive $1 billion restoration effort in California's Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. However, invasions of weeds into riparian, floodplain, and aquatic habitats threaten the success of restoration efforts within the watershed and jeopardize economic activities. The doctrine of early detection and rapid response to invasions has been adopted by land and water resource managers, and remote sensing is the logical tool of choice for identification and detection. However meteorological, physical, and biological heterogeneity in this large system present unique challenges to successfully detecting invasive weeds. We present three hyperspectral case studies which illustrate the challenges, and potential solutions, to mapping invasive weeds in wetland systems: 1) Perennial pepperweed was mapped over one portion of the Delta using a logistic regression model to predict weed occurrence. 2) Water hyacinth and 3) submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV). primarily composed of Brazilian waterweed, were mapped over the entire Delta using a binary decision tree that incorporated spectral mixture analysis (SMA), spectral angle mapping (SAM), band indexes, and continuum removal products. Perennial pepperweed detection was moderately successful; phenological stage influenced detection rates. Water hyacinth was mapped with modest accuracies, and SAV was mapped with high accuracies. Perennial pepperweed and water hyacinth both exhibited significant spectral variation related to plant phenology. Such variation must be accounted for in order to optimally map these species, and this was done for the water hyacinth case study. Submerged aquatic vegetation was not mapped to the species level due to complex non-linear mixing problems between the water column and its constituents, which was beyond the scope of the current study. We discuss our study in the context of providing guidelines for future remote sensing studies of aquatic systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A 20-year comprehensive water clarity database assembled from Landsat imagery, primarily Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, for Minnesota lakes larger than 8 ha in surface area contains data on more than 10,500 lakes at five-year intervals over the period 1985-2005. The reliability of the data was evaluated by examining the precision of repeated measurements on individual lakes within short time periods using data from adjacent overlapping Landsat paths and by comparing water clarity computed from Landsat data to field-collected Secchi depth data. The agreement between satellite data and field measurements of Secchi depth within Landsat paths was strong (average R-2 of 0.83 and range 0.71-0.96). Relationships between late-summer Landsat and field-measured Secchi depth for the combined statewide data similarly were strong (r(2) of 0.77-0.80 for individual time periods and r(2) = 0.78 for the entire database). Lake clarity has strong geographic patterns in Minnesota; lakes in the south and southwest have low clarity, and lakes in the north and northeast tend to have the highest clarity. This pattern is evident at both the individual lake and the ecoregion level. Mean water clarity in the Northern Lakes and Forest and North Central Hardwood Forest ecoregions in central and northern Minnesota remained stable from 1985 to 2005 while decreasing water clarity trends were detected in the Western Corn Belt Plains and Northern Glaciated Plains ecoregions in southern Minnesota, where agriculture is the predominant land use. Mean water clarity at the statewide level also remained stable with an average around 2.25 m from 1985 to 2005. This assessment demonstrates that satellite imagery can provide an accurate method for obtaining comprehensive spatial and temporal coverage of key water quality characteristics that can be used to detect trends at different geographic scales.

AB The most practical way to get spatially broad and continuous measurements of the surface temperature in the data-sparse cryosphere is by satellite remote sensing. The uncertainties in satellite-derived LSTs must be understood to develop internally-consistent decade-scale land surface temperature (LST) records needed for climate studies. In this work we assess satellite-derived "clear-sky" LST products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and LSTs derived from the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) over snow and ice on Greenland. When possible, we compare satellite-derived LSTs with in-situ air temperature observations from Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net) automatic weather stations (AWS). We find that MODIS, ASTER and ETM+ provide reliable and consistent LSTs under clear-sky conditions and relatively-flat terrain over snow and ice targets over a range of temperatures from -40 to 0 degrees C. The satellite-derived LSTs agree within a relative RMS uncertainty of -0.5 degrees C. The good agreement among the LSTs derived from the various satellite instruments is especially notable since different spectral channels and different retrieval algorithms are used to calculate LST from the raw satellite data. The AWS record in-situ data at a "point" while the satellite instruments record data over an area varying in size from: 57 x 57 m (ETM+), 90 x 90 m (ASTER), or to 1 x 1 km (MODIS). Surface topography and other factors contribute to variability of LST within a pixel, thus the AWS measurements may not be representative of the LST of the pixel. Without more information on the local spatial patterns of LST, the AWS LST cannot be considered valid ground truth for the satellite measurements, with RMS uncertainty similar to 2 degrees C. Despite the relatively large AWS-derived uncertainty, we find LST data are characterized by high accuracy but have uncertain absolute precision. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Detailed land use/land cover classification at ecotope level is important for environmental evaluation. In this study, we investigate the possibility of using airborne hyperspectral imagery for the classification of ecotopes. In particular, we assess two tree-based ensemble classification algorithms: Adaboost and Random Forest, based on standard classification accuracy, training time and classification stability. Our results show that Adaboost and Random Forest attain almost the same overall accuracy (close to 70%) with less than 1% difference, and both outperform a neural network classifier (63.7%). Random Forest, however, is faster in training and more stable. Both ensemble classifiers are considered effective in dealing with hyperspectral data. Furthermore, two feature selection methods, the out-of-bag strategy and a wrapper approach feature subset selection using the best-first search method are applied. A majority of bands chosen by both methods concentrate between 1.4 and 1.8 mu m at the early shortwave infrared region. Our band subset analyses also include the 22 optimal bands between 0.4 and 2.5 mu m suggested in Thenkabail et al. [Thenkabail, RS., Enclona, E.A., Ashton, M.S., and Van Der Meer, B. (2004).

All of the three band subsets considered in this study work well with both classifiers as in most cases the overall accuracy dropped only by less than 1%. A subset of 53 bands is created by combining all feature subsets and comparing to using the entire set the overall accuracy is the same with Adaboost, and with Random Forest, a 0.2% improvement. The strategy to use a basket of band selection methods works better. Ecotopes belonging to the tree classes are in general classified better than the grass classes. Small adaptations of the classification scheme are recommended to improve the applicability of remote sensing method for detailed ecotope mapping. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An operational global soil moisture data product is currently generated from the observations of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) aboard NASA's Aqua satellite using the retrieval procedure described in Njoku and Chan [Njoku, E.G. and Chan, SX, 2006. Vegetation and surface roughness effects on AMSR-E land observations, remote sensing environment, 100(2), 190-199]. We have generated another soil moisture dataset from the same AMSR-E observed brightness temperature data using the Land Surface Microwave Emission Model (LSMEM) adopting a different estimation method. This paper focuses on a comparison study of soil moisture estimates from the above two methods. The soil moisture data from current AMSR-E product and LSMEM are compared with the in-situ measured soil moisture datasets over the Little River Experimental Watershed (LREW), Georgia, USA for the year 2003. The comparison study was carried out separately for the AMSR-E daytime and night time overpasses. The LSMEM method performed better than the current operational AMSR-E retrieval algorithm in this study. The differences between the AMSR-E and LSMEM results are mostly due to differences in various simplifications and assumptions made for variables in the radiative transfer equations and the soil and vegetation based physical models and the accuracy of the input Surface temperature datasets for the LSMEM forward model approach. This study confirms that remote sensing data have the potential to provide useful hydrologic information, but the accuracy of the geophysical parameters could vary depending on the estimation methods. It cannot be concluded from this study whether the soil moisture estimation by the LSMEM approach will perform better in other geographic, climatic or topographic conditions. Nevertheless, this study sheds light on the effects of different approaches for the estimation of geophysical parameters, which may be useful for current and future satellite missions.

AB Detection and mapping of invasive species is an important component of conservation and management efforts in Hawai'i, but the spectral separability of native, introduced, and invasive species has not been established. We used high spatial resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy to analyze the canopy hyperspectral reflectance properties of 37 distinct species or phenotypes, 7 common native and 24 introduced tree species, the latter group containing 12 highly invasive species. Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) reflectance and derivative-reflectance signatures of Hawaiian native trees were generically unique from those of introduced trees. Nitrogen-fixing trees were also spectrally unique from other groups of non-fixing trees. There were subtle but significant differences in the spectral properties of highly invasive tree species in comparison to introduced species that do not proliferate across Hawaiian ecosystems. The observed differences in canopy spectral signatures were linked to relative differences in measured leaf pigment (chlorophyll, carotenoids), nutrient (N, P), and structural (specific leaf area; SLA) properties, as well as to canopy leaf area index. These leaf and canopy properties contributed variably to the spectral separability of the trees, with wavelength-specific reflectance and absorption features that overlapped, but which were unique from one another. A combination of canopy reflectance from 1125-2500 nm associated with leaf and canopy water content, along with pigment-related absorption features (reflectance derivatives) in the 400-700 nm range, was best for delineating native, introduced, and invasive species. There was no single spectral region that always defined the separability of the species groups, and thus the full-range (400-2500 nm) spectrum was highly advantageous in differentiating these groups. These results provide a basis for more detailed studies of invasive species in Hawai'i, along with more explicit treatment of the biochemical properties of the canopies and their prediction using imaging spectroscopy.

AB Remote sensing of invasive species is a critical component of conservation and management efforts, but reliable methods for the detection of invaders have not been widely established. In Hawaiian forests, we recently found that invasive trees often have hyperspectral signatures unique from that of native trees, but mapping based on spectral reflectance properties alone is confounded by issues of canopy senescence and mortality, intra- and inter-canopy gaps and shadowing, and terrain variability. We deployed a new hybrid airborne system combining the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) small-footprint light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system with the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) to map the three-dimensional spectral and structural properties of Hawaiian forests. The CAO-AVIRIS systems and data were fully integrated using in-flight and post-flight fusion techniques, facilitating an analysis of forest canopy properties to determine the presence and abundance of three highly invasive tree species in Hawaiian rainforests.
   The LiDAR sub-system was used to model forest canopy height and top-of-canopy surfaces; these structural data allowed for automated masking of forest gaps, intra- and inter-canopy shadows, and minimum vegetation height in the AVIRIS images. The remaining sunlit canopy spectra were analyzed using spatially-constrained spectral mixture analysis. The results of the combined LiDAR-spectroscopic analysis highlighted the location and fractional abundance of each invasive tree species throughout the rainforest sites. Field validation studies demonstrated <6.8% and <18.6% error rates in the detection of invasive tree species at similar to 7 m(2) and similar to 2 m(2) minimum canopy cover thresholds. Our results show that full integration of imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR measurements provides enormous flexibility and analytical potential for studies of terrestrial ecosystems and the species contained within them.

AB In this paper we demonstrate a new approach that uses regional/continental MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived forest cover products to calibrate Landsat data for exhaustive high spatial resolution mapping of forest cover and clearing in the Congo River Basin. The approach employs multi-temporal Landsat acquisitions to account for cloud cover, a primary limiting factor in humid tropical forest mapping. A Basin-wide MODIS 250 m Vegetation Continuous Field (VCF) percent tree cover product is used as a regionally consistent reference data set to train Landsat imagery. The approach is automated and greatly shortens mapping time. Results for approximately one third of the Congo Basin are shown. Derived high spatial resolution forest change estimates indicate that less than 1% of the forests were cleared from 1990 to 2000. However, forest clearing is spatially pervasive and fragmented in the landscapes studied to date, with implications for sustaining the region's biodiversity. The forest cover and change data are being used by the Central African Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE) program to study deforestation and biodiversity loss in the Congo Basin forest zone.

AB Changes in species composition and diversity are the inevitable consequences of climate change, as well as land use and land cover change. Predicting species richness at regional spatial scales using remotely sensed biophysical variables has emerged as a viable mechanism for monitoring species distribution. In this study, we evaluate the utility of MODIS-based productivity (GPP and EVI) and surface water content (NDSVI and LSWI) in predicting species richness in the semi-arid region of Inner Mongolia, China. We found that these metrics correlated well with plant species richness and could be used in biome- and life form-specific models. The relationships were evaluated on the basis of county-level data recorded from the Flora of Inner Mongolia, stratified by administrative (i.e., counties), biome boundaries (desert, grassland, and forest), and grouped by life forms (trees, grasses, bulbs, annuals and shrubs). The predictor variables included: the annual, mean, maximum, seasonal midpoint (EVImid), standard deviation of MODIS-derived GPP, EVI, LSWI and NDSVI. The regional pattern of species richness correlated with GPP(SD) (R-2=0.27), which was also the best predictor for bulbs, perennial herbs and shrubs (R-2=0.36, 0.29 and 0.40, respectively). The predictive power of models improved when counties with >50% of cropland were excluded from the analysis, where the seasonal dynamics of productivity and species richness deviate patterns in natural systems. When stratified by biome, GPPSD remained the best predictor of species richness in grasslands (R-2=0.3 0), whereas the most variability was explained by NDSVImax in forests (R-2=0.26), and LSWIavg in deserts (R-2=0.61). The results demonstrated that biophysical estimates of productivity and water content can be used to predict plant species richness at the regional and biome levels. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Strategic forest inventory programs produce forest resource estimates for large areas such as states and provinces using data collected for a large number of variables on a relatively sparse array of field plots. Management inventories produce stand-level estimates to guide management decisions using data obtained with sampling intensities Much greater than for strategic inventories. The costs associated with these greater sampling intensities have motivated investigations of alternatives to traditional sample-based management inventories. This study focused on a relatively inexpensive alternative to management inventories that uses strategic forest inventory plot data, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite imagery, and the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) technique. The approach entailed constructing stem density and basal area per unit area maps from which stand-level means were estimated as averages of k-NN pixel predictions. The study included investigations of the benefits of selecting optimal combinations of k-NN feature space variables derived from the TM imagery and the benefits of modifying the k-NN technique to eliminate spurious nearest neighbors. For both the stem density and basal area per unit area training data, the selection of optimal feature space covariates produced less than 1.5% improvement in root mean square error relative to using all covariates. The k-NN modification improved the sum of mean squared deviations for stand-level stem density and basal area per unit area estimates by 7-20% depending on the k-NN feature space covariates. For the best combination of feature space covariates, estimates of stand-level means were within confidence intervals for validation estimates for 11 of 12 stands for stem density and for 10 of 12 stands for basal area per unit area.

AB This paper presents a new method developed for the atmospheric correction of the images that will be acquired by the Ven mu s satellite after its launch expected in early 2010. Every two days, the Ven mu s mission will provide 10 m resolution images of 50 sites, in 12 narrow spectral bands ranging from 415 run to 910 nm. The sun-synchronous Ven mu s orbit will have a 2-day repeat cycle, and the images of a given site will always be acquired from the same place, at the same local hour, with constant observation angles. Thanks to these characteristics, the directional effects will be considerably reduced since only the solar angles will slowly vary with time.
   The algorithm that will be implemented for the atmospheric correction of Ven mu s data is being developed using both radiative transfer simulations and the actual data acquired by the Formosat-2 satellite. Because of its one-day sun-synchronous repeat cycle, Formosat-2 acquires images with a sun-viewing geometry close to the one Ven mu s will offer. With this geometry, reflectance time series are free from directional effects on the short term, a feature which reduces the number of unknowns to retrieve. The atmospheric corrections algorithm exploits this feature and the two following assumptions:
   - Aerosol optical properties vary quickly with time but slowly with location.
   - Surface reflectances vary quickly with location but slowly with time.
   Consequently, the top of atmosphere reflectance short term variations (10 to 15 days) are mainly due to the variations of aerosol optical properties, and it is thus possible to use these variations to characterise the atmospheric aerosols and to retrieve surface reflectances.
   This paper first describes the aerosol inversion method we developed and its results when applied to simulations. In the second part, we show the first tests of the method against three data sets acquired by Formosat-2 images with constant observation angles. Aeronet sun photometers measurements were available on all sites. Formosat-2 estimates of optical thickness compare favourably with Aeronet in situ measurements, leading to a noticeable improvement of the smoothness of time series of surface reflectances after atmospheric correction.

AB Using an ensemble of model forecasts to describe forecast error covariance extends linear sequential data assimilation schemes to nonlinear applications. This approach forms the basis of the Ensemble Kalman Filter and derivative filters such as the Ensemble Square Root Filter. While ensemble data assimilation approaches are commonly reported in the scientific literature, clear guidelines for effective ensemble member generation remain scarce. As the efficiency of the filter is reliant on the accurate determination of forecast error covariance from the ensemble, this paper describes an approach for the systematic determination of random error. Forecast error results from three factors: errors in initial condition, forcing data and model equations. The method outlined in this paper explicitly acknowledges each of these sources in the generation of an ensemble. The initial condition perturbation approach presented optimally spans the dynamic range of the model states and allows an appropriate ensemble size to be determined. The forcing data perturbation approach treats forcing observations differently according to their nature. While error from model physics is not dealt with in detail, discussion of some commonly used approaches and their limitations is provided. The paper concludes with an example application for a synthetic coastal hydrodynamic experiment assimilating sea surface temperature (SST) data, which shows better prediction capability when contrasted with standard approaches in the literature.

AB The use of post-classification change methods for the analysis of land cover change provides intuitive and potentially reliable results. A recurring problem is the difference in land cover nomenclature that can occur over time or across space when multiple data sources are required. Building on work that uses category semantics as a foundation for reasoning with land cover classes, this paper uses a fuzzy sets based approach to develop attribute based prototype definitions of land cover classes. These formalized category descriptions are used to look at land cover changes as a semantic change evaluated through semantic similarity metrics. The methodology is illustrated on the U.S. National Land Cover Data from 1992 to 2001 over Chester County, PA. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is more versatile than the standard post-classification method in that it can both provide an overall, spatially explicit evaluation of land cover change, as well as nuanced assessments of graded changes for heteroaeneous land cover types.

AB Floodplain roughness parameterization is one of the key elements of hydrodynamic modeling of river flow, which is directly linked to exceedance levels of the embankments of lowland fluvial areas. The present way of roughness mapping is based on manually delineated floodplain vegetation types, schematized as cylindrical elements of which the height (m) and the vertical density (the projected plant area in the direction of the flow per unit volume, m(-1)) have to be assigned using a look-up table. This paper presents a novel method of automated roughness parameterization. It delivers a spatially distributed roughness parameterization in an entire floodplain by fusion of CASI multispectral data with airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. The method consists of three stages: (1) pre-processing of the raw data, (2) image segmentation of the fused data set and classification into the dominant land cover classes (KHAT=0.78), (3) determination of hydrodynamic roughness characteristics for each land cover class separately. In stage three, a lookup table provides numerical values that enable roughness calculation for the classes water, sand, paved area, meadows and built-up area. For forest and herbaceous vegetation, ALS data enable spatially detailed analysis of vegetation height and density. The hydrodynamic vegetation density of forest is mapped using a calibrated regression model. Herbaceous vegetation cover is further subdivided in single trees and non-woody vegetation. Single trees were delineated using a novel iterative cluster merging method, and their height is predicted (R-2 =0.41, rse=0.84 m). The vegetation density of single trees was determined in an identical way as for forest. Vegetation height and density of non-woody herbaceous vegetation were also determined using calibrated regression models. A 2D hydrodynamic model was applied with the results of this novel method, and compared with a traditional roughness parameterization approach. The modeling results showed that the new method is well able to provide accurate output data. The new method provides a faster, repeatable, and more accurate way of obtaining floodplain roughness, which enables regular updating of river flow models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The potential of multitemporal coarse spatial resolution remotely sensed images for vegetation monitoring is reduced in fragmented landscapes, where most of the pixels are composed of a mixture of different surfaces. Several approaches have been proposed for the estimation of reflectance or NDVI values of the different land-cover classes included in a low resolution mixed pixel. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the estimation of sub-pixel NDVI values from multitemporal coarse resolution satellite data. Sub-pixel NDVIs for the different land-cover classes are calculated by solving a weighted linear system of equations for each pixel of a coarse resolution image, exploiting information about within-pixel fractional cover derived from a high resolution land-use map. The weights assigned to the different pixels of the image for the estimation of subpixel NDVIs of a target pixel i are calculated taking into account both the spatial distance between each pixel and the target and their spectral dissimilarity estimated on medium-resolution remote-sensing images acquired in different periods of the year. The algorithm was applied to daily and 16-day composite MODIS NDVI images, using Landsat-5 TM images for calculation of weights and accuracy evaluation.
   Results showed that application of the algorithm provided good estimates of sub-pixel NDVIs even for poorly represented land-cover classes (i.e., with a low total cover in the test area). No significant accuracy differences were found between results obtained on daily and composite MODIS images. The main advantage of the proposed technique with respect to others is that the inclusion of the spectral term in weight calculation allows an accurate estimate of sub-pixel NDVI time series even for land-cover classes characterized by large and rapid spatial variations in their spectral properties.

AB We present digital image mosaics of surface morphology and optical snow grain size for the Antarctic continent and surrounding islands, assembled from 260 Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. The products are derived from MODIS band I (red light: similar to 647 nm) and band 2 (infrared: similar to 857 nm) orbit swath data acquired during the 2003-2004 austral summer. Multiple images of all areas are combined in a data cumulation scheme to improve spatial resolution and increase radiometric content of the mosaics. The component images were de-striped, geo-registered, and re-sampled to the projection grid using the MODIS Swath-to-Grid Toolbox (MS2GT) software. A 125 m ground-equivalent polar stereographic projection was used, identical to previous radar image mosaics and similar to several other continent-wide data sets. Geo-location accuracy of the final mosaics is better than 125 m. Swath acquisition times were limited to the range 05:00-13:30 UT to provide broad but uniform mosaic illumination. Regions of cloud cover, blowing snow, and intense forward scattering were masked prior to compositing. The MOA snow grain size data set image provides the first continent-wide semi-quantitative map of mean summer snow, firn, and blue ice grain size. Optical grain size (radius) was determined using a normalized difference index derived from MODIS band I and band 2 rad values. Atmospheric correction, adjustments for directional reflectance variation and snow grain size estimation were accomplished by a look-up table, generated by a combination of published models of snow spectral reflectance and atmosphere radiative transfer. Validation of the snow grain size image is provided by in situ spectra of snow-covered sea ice made in October, 2003. We use the new data sets to determine major ice shelf areas, and shelf edge, coastline, and ice grounding line vector files, and determine areas of selected blue ice regions. These data sets are available for download at http://nsidc.org/data/moa/. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB in this paper the possibility of predicting salt concentrations in soils from measured reflectance spectra is studied using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural network (ANN). Performance of these two adaptive methods has been compared in order to examine linear and non-linear relationship between soil reflectance and salt concentration. Experiment-, field- and image-scale data sets were prepared consisting of soil EC measurements (dependent variable) and their corresponding reflectance spectra (independent variables). For each data set, PLSR and ANN predictive models of soil salinity were developed based on soil reflectance data. The predictive accuracies of PLSR and ANN models were assessed against independent validation data sets not included in the calibration or training phase. The results of PLSR analyses suggest that an accurate to good prediction of EC can be made based on models developed from experiment-scale data (R-2>0.81 and RPD (ratio of prediction to deviation)>2.1) for soil samples salinized by bischofite and epsomite minerals. For field-scale data sets, the PLSR predictive models provided approximate quantitative EC estimations (R-2=0.8 and RPD=2.2) for grids 1 and 6 and poor estimations for grids 2, 3, 4 and 5. The salinity predictions from image-scale data sets by PLSR models were very reliable to good (R-2 between 0.86 and 0.94 and RPD values between 2.6 and 4.1) except for sub-image 2 (R-2=0.61 and RPD=1.2). The ANN models from experiment-scale data set revealed similar network performances for training, validation and test data sets indicating a good network generalization for samples salinized by bischofite and epsomite minerals. The RPD and the R-2 between reference measurements and ANN outputs of theses models suggest an accurate to good prediction of soil salinity (R-2>0.92 and RPD>2.3). For the field-scale data set, prediction accuracy is relatively poor (0.69 > R-2 >0.42). The ANN predictive models estimating soil salinity from image-scale data sets indicate a good prediction (R-2>0.86 and RPD>2.5) except for sub-image 2 (R-2=0.6 and RPD=1.2). The results of this study show that both methods have a great potential for estimating and mapping soil salinity. Performance indexes from both methods suggest large similarity between the two approaches with PLSR advantages. This indicates that the relation between soil salinity and soil reflectance can be approximated by a linear function. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Terrestrial Ecosystem Mapping provides critical information to land and resource managers by incorporating information on climate, physiography, surficial material, soil, and vegetation structure. The main objective of this research was to determine the capacity of high spatial resolution satellite image data to discriminate vegetation structural stages in riparian and adjacent forested ecosystems as defined using the British Columbia Terrestrial Ecosystem Mapping (TEM) scheme. A high spatial resolution QuickBird image, captured in June 2005, and coincident field data covering the riparian area of Lost Shoe Creek and adjacent forests on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, was used in this analysis. Semi-variograms were calculated to assess the separability of vegetation structural stages and assess which spatial scales were most appropriate for calculation of grey-level co-occurrence texture measures to maximize structural class separation. The degree of spatial autocorrelation showed that most vegetation structural types in the TEM scheme could be differentiated and that window sizes of 3 X 3 pixels and 11 X 11 pixels were most appropriate for image texture calculations. Using these window sizes, the texture analysis showed that co-occurrence contrast, dissimilarity, and homogeneity texture measures, based on the bands in the visible part of the spectrum, provided the most significant statistical differentiation between vegetation structural classes. Subsequently, an object-oriented classification algorithm was applied to spectral and textural transformations of the QuickBird image data to map the vegetation structural classes. Using both spectral and textural image bands yielded the highest classification accuracy (overall accuracy= 78.95%). The inclusion of image texture increased the classification accuracies of vegetation structure by 2-19%. The results show that information on vegetation structure can be mapped effectively from high spatial resolution satellite image data, providing an additional tool to ongoing aerial photograph interpretation.

AB This paper presents a sub-pixel thermal anomaly detection method based on predicting background pixel intensities using a non-linear function of a plurality of past images of the inspected scene. At present, the multitemporal approach to thermal anomaly detection is in its early development stage. In case of space-borne surveillance the multitemporal detection is complicated by both spatial and temporal variability of background surface properties, weather influences, viewing geometries, sensor noise, residual misregistration, and other factors. We use the problem of fire detection and the MODIS data to demonstrate that advanced multitemporal detection methods can potentially outperform the operationally used optimized contextual algorithms both under morning and evening conditions.

AB A dataset of spectral signatures (leaf level) of tropical dry forest trees and lianas and an airborne hyperspectral image (crown level) are used to test three hyperspectral data reduction techniques (principal component analysis, forward feature selection and wavelet energy feature vectors) along with pattern recognition classifiers to discriminate between the spectral signatures of lianas and trees. It was found at the leaf level the forward waveband selection method had the best results followed by the wavelet energy feature vector and a form of principal component analysis. For the same dataset our results indicate that none of the pattern recognition classifiers performed the best across all reduction techniques, and also that none of the parametric classifiers had the overall lowest training and testing errors. At the crown level, in addition to higher testing error rates (7%), it was found that there was no optimal data reduction technique. The significant wavebands were also found to be different between the leaf and crown levels. At the leaf level, the visible region of the spectrum was the most important for discriminating between lianas and trees whereas at the crown level the shortwave infrared was also important in addition to the visible and near infrared.

AB Exploiting synergies afforded by a host of recently available national-scale data sets derived from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and passive optical remote sensing, this paper describes the development of a novel empirical approach for the provision of regional- to continental-scale estimates of vegetation canopy height. Supported by data from the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), the National Elevation Dataset (NED), the LANDFIRE project, and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001, this paper describes a data fusion and modeling strategy for developing the first-ever high-resolution map of canopy height for the conterminous U.S. The approach was tested as part of a prototype study spanning some 62,000 km(2) in central Utah (NLCD mapping zone 16). A mapping strategy based on object-oriented image analysis and tree-based regression techniques is employed. Empirical model development is driven by a database of height metrics obtained from an extensive field plot network administered by the USDA Forest Service-Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. Based on data from 508 FIA field plots, an average absolute height error of 2.1 m (r=0.88) was achieved for the prototype mapping zone. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spectral invariants can be considered fundamental descriptors of the impact of canopy structure on canopy scattering where the scattering objects are large compared with the wavelength of radiation. The paper uses the concept of canopy spectral. invariants to explore scaling relationships within canopy scattering. A new approximation to the leaf-level PROSPECT scattering model of Jacquemoud and Baret [Jacquemoud, S., & Baret, F. (1990). PROSPECT: A model of leaf optical properties spectra. Remote Sensing of Environment, 34, 75-91.]. is developed by applying the spectral invariant approach to leaf internal scattering, in a similar manner to that which has been used to describe canopy-level scattering. We show that it is possible to express both the canopy- and leaf-level single scattering albedo as a function of canopy spectral invariants. This approach provides a framework through which structural information can be maintained in a self-consistent manner across multiple scales from leaf- to canopy-level scattering, at least for the simple canopy architectures considered. It is demonstrated that the nesting of scales described in these relationships implies limits to the retrieval of absolute concentrations of any biochemical constituents or absolute quantities of the amount of scattering material from hyperspectral observations of total scattering. The implication is that in general it may not be possible to separate the components of structural and biochemical influences on measured total scattering signals. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB An extensive field campaign was carried out for the validation of a previously published reflectance ratio-based algorithm for quantification of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin (PC). The algorithm uses band settings of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) onboard ENVISAT, and should accurately retrieve the PC concentration in turbid, cyanobacteria-dominated waters. As algae and cyanobacteria often co-occur, the algorithm response to varying phytoplankton composition was explored. Remote sensing reflectance and reference pigment measurements were obtained in the period 2001-2005 in Spain and the Netherlands using field spectroradiometry and various pigment extraction methods. Additional field data was collected in Spain in May 2005 to allow intercalibration of spectroradiometry and pigment assessment methods. Two methods for extraction of PC from concentrated water samples, and in situ measured PC fluorescence, compared well. Reflectance measurements with different field spectroradiometers used in Spain and the Netherlands also gave similar results. Residual analysis of PC predicted by the algorithm showed that overestimation of PC mainly occurred in the presence of chlorophylls b and e, and phaeophytin. The errors were strongest at low PC relative to Chl a concentrations. A correction applied for absorption by Chl b markedly improved the prediction. Without such a correction, the quality of the PC prediction still increased markedly with estimates > 50 ring PC m(-3), allowing monitoring of the cyanobacterial status of eutrophic waters. The threshold concentration may be lowered when a high intracellular PC:Chl a ratio or cyanobacterial dominance is expected. Below the limit, predicted PC concentrations should be considered as the highest estimate. We evaluated that remote sensing of both PC and Chl a would allow assessment of cyanobacterial risk to water quality and public health in over 70% of our cases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper describes a correction of directional effects in AVHRR reflectance time series. The method relies on a priori directional signatures, in the red and near infrared, for various surface covers. The reflectance normalization is applied to the historical Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) data set acquired between 1981 and 1999. The high frequency variability in the reflectance time series, which is interpreted as a noise due to varying observation geometry and directional effects, is reduced by a factor greater than 1.7 for most vegetated surfaces. For the analysis of the vegetation annual cycle and its inter-annual variations, we recommend the use of the Difference Vegetation Index (DVI), following a prior correction of the directional effects, instead of the commonly used NDVI. Indeed, DVI appears more robust than NDVI to noise resulting from atmospheric perturbations, which makes it a good candidate for long-term ecological surveys and climate change studies.

AB In this paper, we present a new way of detecting and monitoring flooding through the Autonomous Sciencecraft Experiment (ASE) [Chien, S. T., Debban, C., Yen, R., Sherwood, R. Castano, B., & Cichy, A. G. et al. (2001). ASC Science Study Report, available from http://ASEjpl.nasa. gov], which is part of the Space Technology 6 effort under NASA's New Millennium Program. Recent autonomy experiments conducted on Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) using the ASE flight software have demonstrated the ability of several science algorithms to successfully classify key features including flood-induced changes, in hyperspectral images captured by the EO-1 Hyperion instrument. Furthermore, onboard science analysis on the classified images has been performed, and then used to modify an operational plan without interaction from the ground (Sherwood, R., Chien, S., Tran, D., Cichy, B., Castano, R., Davies, A., et al. (2004). Preliminary results of the autonomous sciencecraft experiment. In: Proceedings of the IEEE Aerospace Conference, Big Sky, MT). These algorithms are used to downlink science data only when change occurs, and to detect features of scientific interests such as flooding, volcanic eruptions, and the formation and breakup of sea ice. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the success of ASE and its implications on detecting, mapping, and monitoring transient processes such as flooding autonomously from space. Mapping of water inundation and its change through time is part of our focus in studying transient processes from space.
   In 2004, hyperspectral data were acquired from the Hyperion instrument for target areas around the world that have a high potential for flooding to develop and test floodwater classifiers. In addition, classifier thresholds were determined from both normal flows and possible flood conditions. The paper introduces the development, testing, and success of the ASE software in detecting and reacting to flooding in near real-time. ASE is now operational and flight-tested, and, thus, ready to use for space-borne reconnaissance. Successful demonstration of the floodwater classifiers includes the capture of a rare flooding event of the Australian Diamantina River during ground testing in February 2004, and the detection of flood-related changes along the Brahrnaputra River in Bangladesh and the Yukon River in Alaska during onboard testing on EO-1 in 2005. Both of these detections led to triggered responses onboard the spacecraft, which included acquiring additional Hyperion scenes. These results pave the way for future smart reconnaissance missions of transient processes on Earth and beyond. It is hoped that ASE will become a default in future missions to increase the science return by introducing spacecraft autonomy for detection and monitoring of science events, which otherwise would be discovered too late or altogether missed.

AB Several investigations indicate that the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) contains information that can be used to complement spectral information for improved land cover classification accuracies. Prior studies on the addition of BRDF information to improve land cover classifications have been conducted primarily at local or regional scales. Thus, the potential benefits of adding BRDF information to improve global to continental scale land cover classification have not yet been explored. Here we examine the impact of multidirectional global scale data from the first Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) spacecraft instrument flown on the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS-1) platform on overall classification accuracy and per-class accuracies for 15 land cover categories specified by the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP).
   A set of 36,648 global training pixels (7 x 6 km spatial resolution) was used with a decision tree classifier to evaluate the performance of classifying POLDER data with and without the inclusion of BRDF information. BRDF 'metrics' for the eight-month POWER on ADEOS-1 archive (10/1996-06/1997) were developed that describe the temporal evolution of the BRDF as captured by a semi-empirical BRDF model. The concept of BRDF 'feature space' is introduced and used to explore and exploit the bidirectional information content. The C5.0 decision tree classifier was applied with a boosting option, with the temporal metrics for spectral albedo as input for a first test, and with spectral albedo and BRDF metrics for a second test. Results were evaluated against 20 random subsets of the training data.
   Examination of the BRDF feature space indicates that coarse scale BRDF coefficients from POLDER provide information on land cover that is different from the spectral and temporal information of the imagery. The contribution of BRDF information to reducing classification errors is also demonstrated: the addition of BRDF metrics reduces the mean, overall classification error rates by 3.15% (from 18.1% to 14.95% error) with larger improvements for producer's accuracies of individual classes such as Grasslands (+8.71%), Urban areas (+8.02%), and Wetlands (+7.82%). User's accuracies for the Urban (+7.42%) and Evergreen Broadleaf Forest (+6.70%) classes are also increased. The methodology and results are widely applicable to current multidirectional satellite data from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), and to the next generation of POLDER-like multi-directional instruments.

AB A fuzzy rule based cloud classification scheme is proposed to estimate the cloud cover from satellite imagery. METEOSAT-5 images are classified into three classes: cloudy, partially cloudy, and clear sky. Five features, which measure the temporal and spatial properties of visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) images of METEOSAT-5, are used for this. The proposed classifier finds out a few human understandable rules (fuzzy rules) using exploratory data analysis. A novel attribute of the system is that it analyzes the behavior of misclassifications during training (i.e., typical mistakes) to extract a few more rules which are augmented to the initial rule base to improve its performance. The scheme is tested on images other than the training image(s) and the performance is found to be quite satisfactory. A post-processing scheme is also developed, which utilizes experts' knowledge to generate additional rules to account for coastal region, sunglint areas, and snow-covered Himalayan region. This improves the performance of the system further. Finally, the classification results are compared with multispectral threshold tests, surface synoptic observations, and total cloud cover (tcdc) of reanalysis data produced by National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The high accuracy achieved by the proposed method may be attributed to (1) better design philosophy of classifiers; (2) good choice for the feature vectors; (3) accurate labeling of training data; and (4) exploitation of experts' knowledge.

AB Dry land areas cover large parts of the land masses of Earth. Of these a large portion is mantled by aeolian (wind-blown) deposits and subjected to aeolian process, i.e., the transport of sand or dust by wind. One of the most prominent morphologies created by wind-driven deposits are dunes and in their larger form draas or mega dunes. These mega duties tend to be widely spaced; very large; often forming a base on which smaller dunes form, producing a compound dune pattern.
   In February 2000 the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, onboard the space shuttle Endeavour flew an interferometric radar system whose objective was to create a DEM of nearly all Earth land masses. In this paper DEM data from the C-band 90 in data set and the X-band 30 in data set were used to map and characterize the height and spacing of the large sand seas (Ergs) on Earth. Only the larger forms of dunes could be mapped reliably. The dune spacing and heights extracted from the SRTM DEMs tended to be in overall agreement with those reported in the literature. In a comparison between the X-band and the C-band data it was found that the X-band data are more sensitive to the smaller scale undulations on the compound dunes and better revealed the full height of the duties.

AB In this paper, we developed a new geospatial database of paddy rice agriculture for 13 countries in South and Southeast Asia. These countries have similar to 30% of the world population and similar to 2/3 of the total rice land area in the world. We used 8-day composite images (500-m spatial resolution) in 2002 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the NASA EOS Terra satellite. Paddy rice fields are characterized by an initial period of flooding and transplanting, during which period a mixture of surface water and rice seedlings exists. We applied a paddy rice mapping algorithm that uses a time series of MODIS-derived vegetation indices to identify the initial period of flooding and transplanting in paddy rice fields, based on the increased surface moisture. The resultant MODIS-derived paddy rice map was compared to national agricultural statistical data at national and subnational levels. Area estimates of paddy rice were highly Correlated at the national level and positively correlated at the subnational levels, although the agreement at the national level was much stronger. Discrepancies in rice area between the MODIS-derived and statistical datasets in some countries can be largely attributed to: (1) the statistical dataset is a sown area estimate (includes multiple cropping practices); (2) failure of the 500-m resolution MODIS-based algorithm in identifying small patches of paddy rice fields, primarily in areas where topography restricts field sizes; and (3) contamination by cloud. While further testing is needed, these results demonstrate the potential of the MODIS-based algorithm to generate updated datasets of paddy rice agriculture on a timely basis. The resultant geospatial database on the area and spatial distribution of paddy rice is useful for irrigation, food security, and trace gas emission estimates in those countries.

AB Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) is an international consortium established to acquire satellite images of the world's glaciers.. analyse them for glacier extent and changes, and assess change data for causes and implications for people and the environment. Although GLIMS is making use of multiple remote-sensing systems, ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and reflection Radiometer) is optimized for many needed observations, including mapping of glacier boundaries and material facies, and tracking of surface dynamics., such as flow vector fields and supraglacial lake development. Software development by GLIMS is geared toward mapping clean-ice and debris-covered glaciers; terrain classification emphasizing snow, ice, water, and admixtures of ice with rock debris; multitemporal change analysis, visualization of images and derived data; and interpretation and archiving of derived data. A global glacier database has been designed at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC, Boulder, Colorado); parameters are compatible with and expanded from those of the World Glacier Inventory (WGI). These technology efforts are summarized here, but will be presented in detail elsewhere. Our presentation here pertains to one broad question: How can ASTER and other satellite multispectral data be used to map, monitor, and characterize the state and dynamics of glaciers and to understand their responses to 20th and 21st century climate change? Our sampled results are not yet glaciologically or climatically representative. Our early results, while indicating complexity, are generally consistent with the glaciology community's conclusion that climate change is spurring glacier responses around the world (mainly retreat). Whether individual glaciers are advancing or retreating, the aggregate average of glacier change must be climatic in origin, as nonclimatic variations average out. We have discerned regional spatial patterns in glaciological response behavior; these patterns are best attributed to climate-change variability and to regional differences in glacier size and response times. In many cases, glacier length changes under-represent the magnitude of glacier ablation, because thinning (sometimes without immediate length changes) is also important. An expanded systematic, uniform analysis of many more glaciers is needed to isolate the glacier response components due to climatic and nonclimatic perturbations, to produce quantitative measures of regional variation in glacier changes, and to predict future regional glacier trends relevant to water resources, glaciological hazards, and global sea level. This comprehensive assessment (to be completed in stages) is expected to lend a critically needed filter to identify successful climate models that explain recent glacier changes and change patterns (and hence, are apt to describe future changes) and to eliminate unsuccessful models.

AB Improved oceanic cloud climatologies and more accurate sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite data (e.g., the Along Track Scanning Radiometer-2 (ATSR-2)) depend upon the identification, and in the case of SST, masking of cloud from the data. Few cloud-screening algorithms for ATSR-2 data, however, have been published. This is unfortunate because, unlike the original ATSR (hereafter referred to as ATSR-1), ATSR-2 has three bands of visible data in addition to its traditional suite of near-to-far thermal infrared bands. A new neural network-based cloud detection algorithm, which accommodates both the nadir and forward views of the ATSR-2, is presented. It evaluates every pixel in the scene, is statistically reproducible, computationally efficient, and requires no knowledge of cloud type. Moreover, the algorithm accurately detects glint radiance, which is often seen in at least one of the 1.6 mu m (and/or visible) views, subpixel cloud near cloud boundaries, low-lying marine stratiform cloud, and does not misinterpret actual ocean thermal gradients as cloud. These latter issues have interfered with many SST retrievals in the past. Dual view/dual channel SST retrievals were derived and validated against buoy data (1 in depth). RMS error between retrieved SST and the buoy data is typically about 0.3 K in regions of minimum SST gradient. Pre-processing of the data is done prior to analysis because some artifacts not seen in ATSR-1 data can seriously compromise both cloud detection and SST retrieval. Detailed comparison between the ATSR operational cloud detection scheme and that developed herein, based upon 1077 scenes, shows that the operational product consistently misinterprets regions of cold but cloud-free oceanic thermal gradient as cloud, leading to a sampling-related warm bias in many of the operational SST products. The basis for this misinterpretation has been identified and quantified. Thus, the operational cloud detection scheme may have to be revised if a fully representative global ocean SST dataset is to be obtained from ATSR data. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study examined the effect of biomass-burning aerosols and clouds on the temporal dynamics of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) exhibited by two widely used, time-series NDVI data products: the Pathfinder AVHRR land (PAL) dataset and the NASA Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS) dataset. The PAL data are 10-day maximum-value NDVI composites from 1982 to 1999 with corrections for Rayleigh scattering and ozone absorption. The GIMMS data are 15-day maximum-value NDVI composites from 1982 to 1999. In our analysis, monthly maximum-value NDVI was extracted from these datasets. The effects were quantified by comparing time-series of NDVI from PAL and GIMMS with observations from the SPOT/VEGETATION sensor and aerosol index data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), and results from radiative transfer simulation. Our analysis suggests that the substantial large-scale NDVI seasonality observed in the south and cast Amazon forest region with PAL and GIMMS is primarily caused by variations in atmospheric conditions associated with biomass-burning aerosols and cloudiness. Reliable NDVI data can be typically acquired from April to July when such effects are relatively low, whereas there is a few effective NDVI data from September to December. In the central Amazon forest region, where aerosol loads are relatively low throughout the year, large-scale NDVI seasonality results primarily from seasonal variations in cloud cover. Careful treatment of these aerosol and cloud effects is required when using NDVI from PAL and GIMMS (or other source) to determine large-scale seasonal and interannual dynamics of vegetation greenness and ecosystem-atmosphere CO2 exchange in the Amazon region.

AB We investigated the potential of using unclassified spectral data for predicting the distribution of three bird species over a similar to 400,000 ha region of Michigan's Upper Peninsula using Landsat ETM+ imagery and 433 locations sampled for birds through point count surveys. These species, Black-throated Green Warbler, Nashville Warbler, and Ovenbird, were known to be associated with forest understory features during breeding. We examined the influences of varying two spatially explicit classification parameters on prediction accuracy: 1) the window size used to average spectral values in signature creation and 2) the threshold distance required for bird detections to be counted as present. Two accuracy measurements, proportion correctly classified (PCC) and Kappa, of maps predicting species' occurrences were calculated with ground data not used during classification. Maps were validated for all three species with Kappa values >03 and PCC >0.6. However, PCC provided little information other than a summary of sample plot frequencies used to classify species' presence and absence. Comparisons with rule-based maps created using the approach of Gap Analysis showed that spectral information predicted the occurrence of these species that use forest subcanopy components better than could be done using known land cover associations (Kappa values 0.1 to 0.3 higher than Gap Analysis maps). Accuracy statistics for each species were affected in different ways by the detection distance of point count surveys used to stratify plots into presence and absence classes. Moderate-to-large detection distances (100 in and 180 in) best classified maps of Black-throated Green Warbler and Nashville Warbler occurrences, while moderate detection distances (50 in and 100 in), which ignored remote observations, provided the best source of information for classification of Ovenbird occurrence. Window sizes used in signature creation also influenced accuracy statistics but to a lesser extent. Highest Kappa values of majority maps were typically obtained using moderate window sizes of 9 to 13 pixels (0.8 to 1.2 ha), which are representative of the study species territory sizes. The accuracy of wildlife occurrence maps classified from spectral data will therefore differ given the species of interest, the spatial precision of occurrence records used as ground references and the number of pixels included in spectral signatures. For these reasons, a quantitative examination is warranted to determine how subjective decisions made during image classifications affect prediction accuracies. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Practical and economic constraints prompt the need of obtaining structural geological information with reduced field effort. This paper presents a methodological strategy for deriving such information from remotely sensed (RS) images Coupled with empirical tectonic models as a way of bridging from regional to local scales. The hypothesis that spatial organisation displayed by small-scale tectonic structures (and not only the large ones) could be correlated with the arrangement of natural linear features observed on RS imagery to allow inferences on the local geological structure was tested. Azimuth direction and subsidiarily length were found to be the most appropriate attributes for spatial characterisation and comparative analyses of line sets. Inferences made of tectonic structures and respective directional arrangements were based on a combination of qualitative (visual analysis of histograms) and statistical methods (non-parametric goodness-of-fit tests). The numerical evaluation of the results of tests expressed in terms of average degree of matching (91% to 95%) and errors (5% of omission errors and 31.2% of commission errors) showed a reasonable efficiency of the inferential approach in predicting the structural geological settings in lithological units as well as in mid-size areas (50 to 90 km(2) approximately), Potential applications of the inferential approach in terrain evaluation schemes, particularly for planning and engineering-related purposes. are envisaged, (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study focuses on the use of coarse spatial resolution (CR, pixel size about 1km(2)) remote sensing data for land cover change detection and qualification. Assuming the linear mixing model for CR pixels, the problem is that both the multitemporal class features and the pixel composition in terms of classes are unknown. The proposed algorithm is then based on the iterative alternate estimation of each unknown variable. At each iteration, the class features are estimated, thanks to the knowledge of the composition of some pixels, and then the pixel composition is re-estimated knowing the class features. The subset of known composition pixels is the subset of pixels where no change has occurred, i.e. the previous land cover map is still valid. It is derived automatically by removing at each iteration the pixels where the new composition estimation disagrees with the former one. Finally, for the final estimation of the pixel composition, a Markovian chain model is used to guide the solution, i.e. the previous land cover map is used as a 'reminder' or,memory' term.
   This approach has been first validated using simulated data with different spatial resolution ratios. Then, the detection of forest change with SPOT/VGT-S 10 has been considered as an actual application case. Finally, the method has been applied to change detection on the Val de Saone watershed between the 1980s and 2000. The results obtained from three coarse resolution series, NOAA/AVHRR, SPOT/VGT-S 10 and SPOT/VGT-P, have been compared. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Estimation of the amount of carbon stored in forests is a key challenge for understanding the global carbon cycle, one which remote sensing is expected to help address. However, carbon storage in moderate to high biomass forests is difficult to estimate with conventional optical or radar sensors. Lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments measure the vertical structure of forests and thus hold great promise for remotely sensing the quantity and spatial organization of forest biomass. In this study, we compare the relationships between lidarmeasured canopy structure and coincident field measurements of forest stand structure at five locations in the Pacific Northwest of the U.S.A. with contrasting composition. Coefficient of determination values (r(2)) ranged between 41% and 96%. Correlations for two important variables, LAI (81%) and aboveground biomass (92%), were noteworthy, as was the fact that neither variable showed an asymptotic response.
   Of the 17 stand structure variables considered in this study, we were able to develop eight equations that were valid for all sites, including equations for two variables generally considered to be highly important (aboveground biomass and leaf area index). The other six equations that were valid for all sites were either related to height (which is most directly measured by lidar) or diameter at breast height (which should be closely related to height). Four additional equations (a total of 12) were applicable to all sites where either Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) or Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensi) were dominant. Stand structure variables in sites dominated by true firs (Abies sp.) or ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) had biases when predicted by these four additional equations. Productivity-related variables describing the edaphic, climatic and topographic environment of the sites where available for every regression, but only two of the 17 equations (maximum diameter at breast height, stem density) incorporated them. Given the wide range of these environmental conditions sarnpled, we conclude that the prediction of stand structure is largely independent of environmental conditions in this study area.
   Most studies of lidar remote sensing for predicting stand structure have depended on intensive data collections within a relatively small study area. This study indicates that the relationships between many stand structure indices and lidar measured canopy structure have generality at the regional scale. This finding, if replicated in other regions, would suggest that mapping of stand structure using lidar may be accomplished by distributing field sites extensively over a region, thus reducing the overall inventory effort required.

   FOOTPRINT
AB Extensive estimates of forest productivity are required to understand the relationships between shifting land use, changing climate and carbon storage and fluxes. Aboveground net primary production of wood (NPPAw) is a major component of total NPP and of net ecosystem production (NEP). Remote sensing of NPP and NPPAW, is generally based on light use efficiency or process-based biogeochemistry models. However, validating these large area flux estimates remains a major challenge. In this study we develop an independent approach to estimating NPPAw, based on stand age and biomass, that could be implemented over a large area and used in validation efforts. Stand age is first mapped by iterative unsupervised classification of a multi-temporal sequence of images from a passive optical sensor (e.g. Landsat TM). Stand age is then cross-tabulated with estimates of stand height and aboveground biomass from lidar remote sensing. NPPAw is then calculated as the average increment in lidar-estimated biomass over the time period determined using change detection. In western Oregon, productivity estimates made using this method compared well with forest inventory estimates and were significantly different than estimates from a spatially distributed biogeochemistry model. The generality of the relationship between lidar-based canopy characteristics and stand biomass means that this approach could potentially be widely applicable to landscapes with stand replacing disturbance regimes, notably in regions where forest inventories are not routinely maintained.

AB Icebergs play an important role in climate through the transfer of fresh water and heat between ice sheets and the oceans. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images offer a robust way of observing icebergs in the often dark and cloud-covered polar areas. A computer-based technique is proposed to identify icebergs at higher resolution than in the past, allowing the shape of small to medium icebergs to be retained and used for tracking between images acquired at different times. The identification consists of (i) automatic segmentation, followed by (ii) classification of these objects as icebergs or nonicebergs. The classification stage requires user intervention as the icebergs are not always a separable class from other objects, most notably sea ice. The icebergs are then matched between images using their size and shape similarities, and their position tracked. The system performance was assessed by applying the technique to three wintertime ERS-1 PRI images, around Kapp Norvegia (10degreesW), on the Eastern Weddell Sea coast. The results show both the identification and the tracking to be effective. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The accuracy of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day albedo product (MOD43) is assessed using ground-based albedo observations from automatic weather stations (AWS) over spatially homogeneous snow and semihomogeneous ice-covered surfaces on the Greenland ice sheet. Data from 16 AWS locations, spanning the years 2000-2003, were used for this assessment. In situ reflected shortwave data were corrected for a systematic positive spectral sensitivity bias of between 0.01 and 0.09 on a site-by-site basis using precise optical black radiometer data. Results indicate that the MOD43 albedo product retrieves snow albedo with an average root mean square error (RMSE) of +/-0.07 as compared to the station measurements, which have +/-0.035 RMSE uncertainty. If we eliminate all satellite retrievals that rely on the backup algorithm and consider only the highest quality results from the primary bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) algorithm, the MODIS albedo RMSE is +/-0.04, slightly larger than the in situ measurement uncertainty. There is general agreement between MODIS and in situ observations for albedo <0.7, while near the upper limit, a -0.05 MODIS albedo bias is evident from the scatter of the 16-site composite.

AB A new database of fire activity in Russia derived from I-km resolution remote sensing imagery is presented and discussed. The procedure used to generate this burned-area product is described, including active-fire detection and burn-scar mapping approaches. Fire detection makes use of a probabilistic procedure using image data from the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) system. Using the combination of AVHRR data collected at the Krasnoyarsk, Russia, high-resolution picture transmission (HRPT) receiving station, and data from the NOAA Satellite Active Archive (SAA), fire maps are being created for all of Russia for 1995 to 1997 and all of Eastern Russia (east of the Ural Mountains) for 1995 to 2002. This mapping effort has resulted in the most complete set of historic fire maps available for Russia. An initial validation indicates that the burned-area estimates are conservative because the approaches do not detect smaller fires, and, in many cases, fire areas are slightly underestimated. Analyses using the fire database showed that an average of 7.7 x 10(6) ha yr(-1) of fire occurred in Eastern Russia between 1996 and 2002 and that fire was widely dispersed in different regions. The satellite-based burned-area estimates area were two to five times greater than those contained in official government burned-area statistics. The data show that there is significant interannual variability in area burned, ranging between a low of 1.5 x 10(6) ha in 1997 to a high of 12.1 x 10(6) ha in 2002. Seasonal patterns of fire are similar to patterns seen in the North American boreal region, with large-fire seasons experiencing more late-season burning (in August and September) than during low-fire years. There was a distinct zonal distribution of fires in Russia; 65% of the area burned occurred in the taiga zone, which includes southern, middle, and northern taiga subzones, 20% in the steppe and forest steppe zones, 12% in the mixed forest zone, and 3% in the tundra and forest-tundra zones. Lands classified as forest experienced 55% of all burned area, while crops and pastures, swamps and bogs, and grass and shrubs land cover categories experienced 13% to 15% each. Finally, the utility of the products is discussed in the context of fire management and carbon cycling. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Siberia snow depth climato logy derived from SSM/I data using a combined
   dynamic and static algorithm
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB One of the major challenges in determining snow depth (SD) from passive microwave measurements is to take into account the spatiotemporal variations of the snow grain size. Static algorithms based on a constant snow grain size cannot provide accurate estimates of snow pack thickness, particularly over large regions where the snow pack is subjected to big spatial temperature variations. A recent dynamic algorithm that accounts for the dependence of the microwave scattering on the snow grain size has been developed to estimate snow depth from the Special Sensor Microwave/imager (SSM/I) over the Northern Great Plains (NGP) in the US.
   In this paper, we develop a combined dynamic and static algorithm to estimate snow depth from 13 years of SSM/I observations over Central Siberia. This region is characterised by extremely cold surface air temperatures and by the presence of permafrost that significantly affects the ground temperature. The dynamic algorithm is implemented to take into account these effects and it yields accurate snow depths early in the winter, when thin snowpacks combine with cold air temperatures to generate rapid crystal growth. However, it is not applicable later in the winter when the grain size growth slows. Combining the dynamic algorithm to a static algorithm, with a temporally constant but spatially varying coefficient, we obtain reasonable snow depth estimates throughout the entire snow season. Validation is carried out by comparing the satellite snow depth monthly averages to monthly climatological data. We show that the location of the snow depth maxima and minima is improved when applying the combined algorithm, since its dynamic portion explicitly incorporate the thermal gradient through the snowpack. The results obtained are presented and evaluated for five different vegetation zones of Central Siberia. Comparison with in situ measurements is also shown and discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB The concentrations of various foliar chemicals can be estimated by analyzing the spectral reflectance of dried ground leaves. The continuum-removal analysis of Kokaly and Clark [Remote Sens. Environ. 67 (1999) 267] has been an improvement on the standard derivative analysis in such applications. Continuum-removal analysis enables the isolation of absorption features of interest, thus increasing the coefficients of determination and facilitating the identification of more sensible absorption features. The purpose of this study was to test Kokaly and Clark's methodology with aircraft-acquired hyperspectral data of eucalypt tree canopies, which are more complex than are spectra from many coniferous canopies and much more complex than the spectra from dried ground leaves. The results of the continuum-removal analysis were most encouraging. It identified, in one experiment or another, almost all of the known nitrogen absorption features. The coefficient of determination in one case increased from 0.65, using the standard derivative analysis, to 0.85 with the continuum-removal analysis. It is recommended that continuum-removal analysis become at least a supplement to standard derivative analysis in estimating foliar biochemical concentrations from remote sensing data. This study also reports several other findings: (1) the neural network method generally achieved higher coefficients of determination and lower errors of estimation [root mean square error (RMSE) and standard error of cross validation (SECV)] than did the modified partial least squares (PLS) or stepwise regression methods, probably indicating nonlinear relationships between biochemical concentrations and canopy reflectance; (2) modified partial least squares (MPLS) proved a better statistical method than conventional stepwise regression analysis in many cases in terms of both coefficient of determination and RMSE; and (3) the maximum spectrum of a cluster of tree pixels represents canopy reflectance at least as well as the mean spectrum of the cluster, especially when used in conjunction with the modified partial least squares method.

AB The potential of radiative transfer modelling and inversion techniques for operational uses is investigated in order to retrieve leaf area index in a poplar plantation. The I-D bidirectional canopy reflectance model SAIL, coupled with the leaf optical properties model PROSPECT, was inverted with hyperspectral airborne DAIS data by means of an iterative method. The root mean square error in LAI estimation was determined against in situ measurements in order to evaluate the impact of different inversion strategies on the LAI retrieval accuracy. These included the selection of an optimal spectral sampling set, the exploitation of prior knowledge in the inversion process and the use of multiview angle data. We claim that the best configuration is achieved by exploiting multiview DAIS data and prior knowledge information about the model variables (RMSE of 0.39 m(2) m(-2)). It is also shown that the use of prior knowledge and the selection of a limited number of bands forming the optimal spectral sampling are instrumental in increasing the accuracy of the inversion process. Our analysis confirms the operational potential of model inversion for biophysical parameter retrieval. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Three major problems are faced when mapping natural vegetation with mid-resolution satellite images using conventional supervised classification techniques: defining the adequate hierarchical level for mapping; defining discrete land cover units discernible by the satellite; and selecting representative training sites. In order to solve these problems, we developed an approach based on the: (1) definition of ecologically meaningful units as mosaics or repetitive combinations of structural types, (2) utilization of spectral information (indirectly) to define the units, (3) exploration of two alternative methods to classify the units once they are defined: the traditional, Maximum Likelihood method, which was enhanced by analyzing objective ways of selecting the best training sites, and an alternative method using Discriminant Functions directly obtained from the statistical analysis of signatures. The study was carried out in a heterogeneous mountain rangeland in central Argentina using Landsat data and 251 field sampling sites. On the basis of our analysis combining terrain information (a matrix of 251 stands x 14 land cover attributes) and satellite data (a matrix of 251 stands x 8 bands), we defined 8 land cover units (mosaics of structural types) for mapping, emphasizing the structural types which had stronger effects on reflectance. The comparison through field validation of both methods for mapping units showed that classification based on Discriminant Functions produced better results than the traditional Maximum Likelihood method (accuracy of 86% vs. 78%).

AB Passive microwave-derived ice edge locations in the Antarctic are assessed against in situ observations from ships between 1989 and 2000. During the growth season (March-October), the ship data agrees with satellite data very well, with r(2) values of 0.99 and 0.97 for the Bootstrap and Team algorithms, respectively. During the melt season (November-February), the agreement is not so good with the passive microwave ice edge typically 1-2degrees of latitude south of the observations. This is due to the low concentration and saturated nature of the ice, and the r(2) values for this period are 0.92 and 0.80 for the Bootstrap and Team algorithms, respectively. Sensitivity studies show that such an offset in the summer ice edge location can cause significant errors in trend studies of the extent of sea ice cover in the Southern Ocean. The passive microwave ice concentration at the ice edge observed by ship varies greatly, averaging 14% for the Team algorithm and 19% for the Bootstrap. Comparisons between passive microwave data and SAR, Landsat and OLS data during the ice growth season show that while small-scale details in ice edge location are lost, the passive microwave data generally provide good and consistent representation of the higher resolution imagery.

AB A feasibility study of land surface temperature (LST) and land surface emissivity (LSE) estimation is presented using METEOSAT Second Generation (MSG)/Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) data, based on the two-temperature method (TTM). The performance of TTM was assessed by taking into consideration the noise in SEVIRI channels IR 10.8 and IR 12.0 as well as the errors in the atmospheric profiles. Imposed errors due to uncertainties on atmospheric information were generated based on the background error covariance matrix used in the assimilation scheme of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Global Circulation Model. TTM has provided LST values with averaged error bias [root-mean square error (RMSE)] ranging from 0.0 to 0.5 K (from 0.8 to 2.5 K) for geographical-seasonal model atmospheres stored in MODTRAN4 with water vapor content varying between 0.85 and 4.11 g cm(-2). Obtained results suggest that TTM may be used as a complementary method to split-window (SW) algorithms over areas where LSE is not well known a priori. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Stand age distribution in boreal forests reflects past disturbances, which is a major determinant of the carbon strength (sink or source). We used mapped and dated fire scars as a reference and developed a remote sensing algorithm for mapping boreal forest stand age distribution that accounts for other stand-replacing disturbances such as harvesting. Considering its strong discriminatory capacity on vegetation type and stand age, a short-wave vegetation index (SWVI) (Remote Sensing of Environment 82 (2002) 95), calculated from the SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) near-infrared and short-wave infrared bands, was utilized to quantify forest regeneration following fire. Stand age of a pixel was then determined by its SWVI value in comparison with the known ones from the dated fire scars. A change indicator (Latifovic, R. (2001). VGT and AVHRR Manager User manual. Canada Centre for Remote Sensing, Natural Resources Canada. Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), which considered interannual changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from sequential NOAA Advanced Very-High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery (1993-1998), was employed to differentiate areas with lower SWVI values resulting from biophysical factors other than disturbances. We evaluated the stand age distribution product using Landsat TM imagery and discussed the limits and constraints of the remote sensing approach of deriving stand age distribution in the boreal forest region.

AB The distribution and abundance of the fleet targeting Jumbo flying squid (Dosidicus gigas) in the Eastern Pacific is examined during the 1999 fishery season. The commercial fishery consists of a multinational jigging fleet, which fish at night using powerful lights to attract squid. The emission of light from these vessels can be observed using - satellite-derived imagery obtained by the United States Defence Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS). In order to quantify fishing effort using lights, data on the distribution and abundance of vessels were obtained via satellite tracking using the ARGOS system. The distribution of the fishery as derived from light signatures was found to closely resemble that derived from ship location data. By using ARGOS data to calibrate DMSP-OLS images, we are able to estimate fishing effort in terms of the 'area illuminated' by the fishing fleet. Light signatures derived from DMSP-OLS were successfully used to quantify fishing effort, estimating the number of vessels fishing to within 2 in 85 out of 103 satellite images (83%). High seas fishing was also quantified, with light signatures corresponding to a single fishing vessel observed in I I out of 103 satellite passes during the fishery season (July-December 1999). This study examines how much light (in terms of area) is emitted by a single squid fishing vessel, and may prove to be a valuable tool in assessing and policing fisheries using satellite remote sensing.

In this paper, we developed and validated the satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), using site-specific CO2 flux and climate data from a temperate deciduous broadleaf forest at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. The VPM model is built upon the conceptual partitioning of photosynthetically active vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) within the leaf and canopy. It estimates GPP, using satellite-derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), air temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). Multi-year (1998-2001) data analyses have shown that EVI had a stronger linear relationship with GPP than did the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Two simulations of the VPM model were conducted, using vegetation indices from the VEGETATION (VGT) sensor onboard the SPOT-4 satellite and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Terra satellite. The predicted GPP values agreed reasonably well with observed GPP of the deciduous broadleaf forest at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts. This study highlighted the biophysical performance of improved vegetation indices in relation to GPP and demonstrated the potential of the VPM model for scaling-up of GPP of deciduous broadleaf forests.

AB How does snow's anisotropic directional reflectance affect the mapping of snow properties from imaging spectrometer data? This sensitivity study applies two spectroscopy models to synthetic images of the spectral hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF) with prescribed snow-covered area and snow grain size. The MEMSCAG model determines both sub-pixel snow-covered area and the grain size of the fractional snow cover. The Nolin/Dozier model analyzes the ice absorption feature that spans wavelength lambda congruent to 1.03 mum to estimate snow grain radius when the pixel is fully snow-covered. Retrievals of subpixel snow-covered area with MEMSCAG are progressively more sensitive to the HDRF as grain size decreases, solar zenith angle increases, and fractional snow cover increases. The model overestimates snow cover in the forward reflectance angles by up to + 20% and underestimates it in the backward reflectance angles by as much as - 15%. Grain size retrievals from both MEMSCAG and Nolin/Dozier are more sensitive to anisotropy as grain size and solar zenith angle increase. MEMSCAG retrievals of grain size are insensitive to snow-covered area. The largest inferred grain sizes occur around a peak in the backward reflectance angles and the smallest generally occur at the largest view angles in the forward direction. Retrievals of albedo from MEMSCAG and Nolin/Dozier are similarly sensitive to anisotropy, with albedo errors up to 5% for a 30degrees solar zenith angle and up to 10% at 60degrees. The albedo differences between the two models are less than 0.015 for all grain sizes and solar zenith angles. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an approach to estimating soil moisture content through fitting an inverted Gaussian function to the continuum in soil spectra. The soil moisture Gaussian model (SMGM) estimates the water content by the declining reflectance in the near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions, 1.2-2.5 mum, due to the spreading of the fundamental water absorption at 2.8 mum. Convex hull boundary points were used to isolate the spectral continuum and to fit the inverted Gaussian function. The function extrapolates the continuum to the fundamental water absorption beyond the wavelength limits of common laboratory, field, and airborne instruments. Of the derived functional parameters, both amplitude and area on the shortwave side of the inverted Gaussian curve were highly correlated with soil water content.

AB Farmers throughout the world are constantly searching for ways to maximize their returns. Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) may provide technologies needed for farmers to maximize the economic and environmental benefits of precision fanning. However, most farmers do not have the skills to utilize these technologies effectively. Through a learning community approach led by the Upper Midwest Aerospace Consortium (UMAC), information was shared among scientists, agricultural producers, and data providers. Farmers and ranchers received value-added information derived from AVHRR, MODIS, ETM+, IKONOS, Digit Inc's DALSA camera system and Positive Systems' ADAR 5500 digital aerial camera, over four growing seasons. Emphasis has been placed on reducing the time between data acquisition and delivery of value-added products to farmers, developing practical uses for the data and providing basic training so that the end users could understand how to interpret the information. Farmers and ranchers in rural areas were connected via wide-bandwidth satellite link to a central distribution center at the University of North Dakota. The farmers participated actively in evaluating the usefulness of inputs derived from remotely sensed data, sometimes even by conducting experiments on fertilizer and fungicide applications and assessing the economic benefits. Resulting applications included management zone delineation, verifying the effectiveness of variable-rate fertilizer applications, verifying the effectiveness of fungicide applications, quantifying the loss due to accidental spray drift damage, selecting acres within sugar beet fields under the Payment in Kind program, and monitoring physical damage due to insect, inundation, wind and bail. Several other in-field, early season management practices were also reviewed using high-resolution images. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB As cropland and pasture have replaced forest and cerrado in Brazilian Amazonia, concern has mounted over the effects of changing the biogeochemical and hydrological properties of one of the world's great storehouses of biomass and biodiversity. Although much recent effort has focused on the location, effects, and causes of deforestation and cerrado conversion, much less is known about the basin-wide spatial distribution and density of the land use following conversion for crops or pasture.
   In this paper, we use census and satellite records to develop maps of the distribution and abundance of major agricultural land uses across 4.5 x 10(8) ha of Brazilian Amazonia in 1980 and 1995. Results indicate an overall expansion of 7.0 x 10(6) ha in total agricultural area in Brazilian Amazonia between 1980 and 1995. The net change during this period is estimated for three different land-use types: croplands (an increase of 0.8 x 10(6) ha), natural pastures (a decrease of 8.4 x 10(6) ha), and planted pastures (an increase of 14.7 x 10(6) ha). These estimates, the first spatially explicit quantifications of agricultural land-use activities in 1980 and 1995 across Brazilian Amazonia, are shown to be consistent with the results of applying a land use change and secondary regrowth model to published deforestation rates for the period.
   The resulting time slices, presented for each land-use category at 5-min (similar to9 km) spatial resolution, allow for the quantification of land-use changes in this region for biogeochemical, demographic and economic models. Several foci of agricultural change existed within Brazilian Amazonia during this period: in the state of Pari, cropland was lost and planted pasture increased markedly; in Mato Grosso, both cropland and planted pasture increased; in Rondonia, planted pasture replacing forest was the primary route to agricultural expansion.

AB Quantification of plant litter cover on the soil surface is necessary in both agricultural and natural systems because the presence of litter influences the flow of nutrients, carbon, water, and energy in terrestrial ecosystems. Although remote sensing methods for measuring plant litter cover provide both a wider area of coverage and a more objective estimate of the spatial variability of litter than manual methods of quantifying the nongreen vegetation landscape components (e.g., litter or soil percent cover), it has been difficult to assess the efficiency of detecting partial litter cover over different soil types. The objectives of this study were (i) to acquire spectral reflectance data for four crop residues and two forest litter types in mixed scenes of soil and plant litter, (ii) to derive relationships that show the spectral variable, cellulose absorption index (CAI), as a function of the amount of litter on the soil surface, and (iii) to test whether the variability of soil background reflectance inhibits the detection of residues and/or the ability to quantify residue cover. Scenes of known amounts of plant litter covering three contrasting soils were prepared and their reflectance spectra (0.4-2.5 mum) were measured with a hyper-resolution spectroradiometer. Litter from four crop (corn, soybean, rice, and wheat) and two tree species (coniferous and deciduous) were included. The CAI (0.5(R-2.0 + R-2.2) - R-2.1) describes the average depth of the cellulose absorption feature at 2.1 mum in reflectance spectra. Positive values of CAI indicate the presence of cellulose. The mean CAI of the soils was -2.0 while the mean CAI of the plant litter was 5.2. CAI increased linearly for each plant litter as the amount of plant litter in the scene increased from 0% (bare soil) to 100% cover. The CAI values of mixed scenes with more than 10% litter cover were significantly larger than the CAI values of the soils. The results of this study indicate that CAI is useful for quantifying plant litter cover, even at low percent cover. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Red-attack damage caused by mountain pine beetle (Dentroctonus ponderosa Hopkins) infestation in stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in the Prince George Forest Region of British Columbia was examined using multitemporal Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery acquired in 1999, 2000, and 2001. The image data were geometrically and atmospherically corrected, and processed using the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) to obtain wetness indices. The final steps included pixel subtraction, enhancement, and thresholding of the wetness index differences. The resulting enhanced wetness difference index (EWDI) was used to interpret spectral patterns in stands with confirmed (through aerial survey) red-attack damage in 2001, and these EWDI patterns were compared to the patterns of reflectance in normal-colour composites. We stratified the aerial survey dataset into two levels and used the EWDI to discriminate classes of 10-29 red-attack trees and 30-50 red-attack trees, and a sample of healthy forest collected from inventory data. Classification accuracy of red-attack damage based on the EWDI ranged from 67% to 78% correct. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate the abilities of seven remote sensors to classify coral, algae, and carbonate sand based on 10,632 reflectance spectra measured in situ on reefs around the world. Discriminant and classification analyses demonstrate that full-resolution (1 nm) spectra provide very good spectral separation of the bottom-types. We assess the spectral capabilities of the sensors by applying to the in situ spectra the spectral responses of two airborne hyperspectral sensors (AAHIS and AVIRIS), three satellite broadband multispectral sensors (Ikonos, Landsat-ETM+ and SPOT-HRV), and two hypothetical satellite narrowband multispectral sensors (Proto and CRESPO). Classification analyses of the simulated sensor-specific spectra produce overall classification accuracy rates of 98%, 98%, 93%, 91%, 64%, 58%, and 50% for AAHIS, AVIRIS, Proto, CRESPO, Ikonos, Landsat-ETM+, and SPOT-HRV, respectively. Analyses of linearly mixed sensor-specific spectra reveal that the hyperspectral and narrowband multispectral sensors have the ability to discriminate between coral and algae across many levels of mixing, while the broadband multispectral sensors do not. Applying the results of the general mixing analyses to a specific spatial organization of coral, algae, and sand indicates that the hyperspectral sensors accurately estimate areal cover of the bottom-types regardless of pixel resolution. The narrowband multispectral sensors overestimate coral cover by 11-15%, while the broadband sensors underestimate algae cover by 7-29% and overestimate coral cover by 24-103%. We conclude that currently available satellite sensors are inadequate for assessment of global coral reef status, but that it is both necessary and possible to design a sensor system suited to the task.

AB Optical thickness of Asian dust aerosols over the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan were retrieved from the visible data of the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS-5) observed on April 7 and 8, 2000, through look-up tables generated by the doubling and adding method. The retrieved optical thickness, by using conventional spherical particle models, showed unnatural decrease in the middle of day time. The decrease disappeared by the use of the semiempirical theory for nonspherical particles by Pollack and Cuzzi [J. Atmos. Sci. 37 (1980) 868.]. These results are explained by the difference of the phase functions between spherical and nonspherical particles and also the variation of the scattering angle for the target dust area during the satellite measurements. Our results confirm that the use of nonspherical particle model improves the retrieval of dust optical thickness from space. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To facilitate the identification of appropriate post-fire watershed treatments and minimize erosion effects after socio-economically important fires, Interagency Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) teams produce initial timely estimates of the fire perimeter and classifications of burn severity, forest mortality, and vegetation mortality. Accurate, cost-effective, and minimal time-consuming methods of mapping fire are desirable to assist rehabilitation efforts immediately after containment of the fire. BAER teams often derive their products by manually interpreting color infrared aerial photos and/or field analysis. Automated classification of multispectral satellite data are examined to determine whether they can provide improved accuracy over manually digitized aerial photographs. In addition, pre-fire vegetation data are incorporated to determine whether further gains in accuracy of mapped canopy consumption can be made. BAER team classifications from the Cerro Grande Fire were compared to estimates of overstory consumption produced using a pre-fire vegetation classification, and a change detection algorithm using bands 4 and 7 from July 1997 pre-fire Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and July 2000 post-fire Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) data. BAER team classifications are highly correlated to overstory consumption and should produce high Kappa statistics when verified using the same dataset. Our three-class supervised classification of the change image incorporating a pre-fire vegetation classification yielded the highest Kappa at 0.86. A three-class unsupervised classification of the change image yielded a lower Kappa of 0.72. BAER team classifications yielded Kappas ranging from 0.38 to 0.63 using the same verification dataset.

AB Forest succession is a fundamental ecological process, which has significant implications for sustainable natural resource management as well as ecosystem biological, biophysical, and biogeochemical processes. Remote sensing is perhaps the only viable option to monitor succession in forest ecosystems over large areas in a timely and cost efficient manner. This study integrates the geometric-optical and radiative transfer (GORT) canopy reflectance model with the ZELIG forest ecosystem dynamics model to study the manifestation of forest succession in optical imagery. The spectral/temporal trajectories associated with forest succession are highly nonlinear. The rate of change in spectral space through time is faster during the early years of succession. The succession trajectories do not proceed linearly in the spectral space, but rather curvilinearly, and are strongly influenced by initial background/understory conditions and topography. The nonlinear nature of the trajectories implies that adequate characterization of forest development with remote sensing requires multiple images through time. Validation using multiple Landsat TM images for the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest (HJA) in the Cascade Range of Oregon found the expected successional trajectories in successfully regenerated young stands. The simulated effects of topography on successional trajectories exist in the Landsat data. The primary challenge in using multitemporal imagery to monitor forest succession is to minimize the effects of various kinds of noise, including varying atmospheric effects, phenology, changes in sun and viewing angles, and topography. The current linkage of GORT-ZELIG only captures the spectral/temporal changes for young stands. Successional changes associated with mature and old-growth stands due to changes in the materials comprising the canopy are not captured. Further research is necessary to include changes associated with mature and old-growth forests, and to develop operational algorithms to utilize information from multitemporal imagery to monitor forest succession.

AB Spatially well-distributed information on the regional fraction of snow-covered area (SCA) is important to snow hydrology during the melting season. One approach for regional SCA estimation using visible and near-infrared reflectances is based on linear interpolation between reference reflectances for full snow cover and snow-free conditions. We present an improved method for National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA/AVHRR) imagery with (1) an automated determination of reference reflectances by distinguishing vet and dry snow conditions and, on the other hand. near melt-off and totally melt-off conditions and (2) an employment of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to avoid overestimations due to vegetation cover at the end of the melting season. The study site covers the area of Finland, which serves as an example of the Eurasian boreal coniferous forest zone. Finnish drainage basins are used as areal calculation units in order to produce feasible information for hydrological models. Since the frequent cloudiness in the northern latitudes reduces the availability of optical data. c developed a technique to generate reference reflectances for basins that were obscured at the actual moment of data retrieval. For a basin without a reference value, the proper values were derived from a basin of the same characteristics the similarity was described with a special Forest Sparseness Index generated from AVHRR data. The linear interpolation method with the additional features was tested for AVHRR imagery during melting period 2000. Validation against a comprehensive network of ground observations at snow courses and breather stations indicated good performance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB ERS wind scatterometer (WSC) time series are analyzed over different ecoclimatic regions of the African Sahel during the period 1991 - 1995. At 45degrees incidence angle, the strong seasonality of sigma(o) time series can be directly linked to the successive wet and dry seasons. Moreover, the annual sigma(o) dynamic range was found to be strongly correlated to total rainfall. The interpretation of the sigma(o) temporal plots is carried out by combining a backscattering model to a grassland growth model. Results highlight the decreasing contribution of the herbaceous component with latitude. However, its contribution is far from negligible and can reach 60% in the Soudano-Sahelian subzone at peak herbaceous mass. Additionally, the tree layer has a negligible effect on the radar signal at the scale of a resolution cell. Finally, a simple parametric backscattering model is calibrated arid used in an inversion process. The resolution of the inverse problem is based on a 'brute-force' method that consists of exploring all the combinations of parameters of interest. Despite a poor estimation of the temporal variation of the herbaceous mass B-t, the retrieved maximum mass compares well with ground estimates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An experimental method for determining water composition from "ocean colour" satellite data, in visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, is applied to highly turbid waters. Numerous spectroradiometric measurements are carried out in the Gironde estuary, for suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations ranging between 35 and more than 2000 mg l(-1). Empirical relationships are established between remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) in SPOT-HRV bands and SPM concentration through these numerous in situ measurements. We observed that remote-sensing reflectance increases with SPM concentration and that the SPOT bands saturate at the highest turbidities. The best correlations are obtained for the NIR band XS3 (790- 890 nm) and for the reflectance ratios: R-rs(XS3)/R-rs(XS1) and R-rs(XS3)/R-rs(XS2). The XS1 and XS2 visible bands are only used to determine SPM concentrations in the lower part of the estuary (where the SPM concentrations are lower). As a result, SPM concentrations within the surface waters in the estuary are estimated up to 2000 mg l(-1) with an accuracy better than +/-35%. The algorithm is finally applied to a SPOT scene. Satellite data are corrected for atmospheric effects using a radiative transfer code and in situ reflectance measurements; as a result, the horizontal distribution of SPM is retrieved. Moreover, the high spatial resolution HRV-SPOT sensor shows detailed sedimentary flows, especially in the visible XS1 and XS2 spectral bands. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The French Guiana coast, located about 00 kin north of the Amazon mouth, is characterized by mangroves and large mud banks migrating northwestwards. These banks are composed of fine clay sediments originating from the Amazon River. In November 1998, field work was carried out on the Mahury River to measure the water colour and the concentration of suspended particles in surface water. An increase of the remote sensing reflectance due to high concentration of mineral particles was observed. The Mahury River survey (November 1998). together with an oceanographic survey onboard the ANTEA vessel (PRECHICO cruise, April 1999), enabled us to identify several classes of remote sensing reflectance spectra characterizing the continental shelf between Cayenne and the Brazil frontier: (1) light blue waters above the shelf break: (2) low salinity dark brown waters above the continental shelf. originating from the Amazon River (3) green waters above the 20-m isobath and (4) beige waters close to the coast and in the rivers mouths. The normalized water leaving radiances (nLw) computed from these spectra in the spectral bands of SeaWiFS are examined. The standard OC2 performs poorly in retrieving chlorophyll front the reflectance data because of the relatively high suspended particulate matter concentrations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Forested ecosystems in California are undergoing accelerated change due to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Change detection is a remote sensing technique used to monitor and map landcover change between two or more time periods and is now an essential tool in forest management activities. We compared the ability of two linear change enhancement techniques, the Multitemporal Kauth Thomas (MKT) and Multitemporal Spectral Mixture Analysis (MSMA), and two classification techniques, maximum likelihood (NIL) and decision tree (DT), to accurately identify changes in vegetation cover in a southern California study area between 1990 and 1996. Supervised classification accuracy results were high (>70% correct classification for four vegetation change classes and one no-change class) and showed that (1) the DT classification approach outperformed the ML classification approach by similar to 10%, regardless of the enhancement technique used, and (2) using DT classification, MSMA change fractions [i.e., green vegetation (GV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), shade, and soil] outperformed MKT change features (i.e., change in brightness, greenness, and wetness) by similar to 5%.

AB In this study, four approaches to estimate atmospheric water vapor from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations were tested with data from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) and the Oklahoma Mesonetwork. The approaches studied were (i) the split-window difference of the thermal channels (Channel 4: 10.3-11.3 mum and Channel 5: 11.5-12.5 mum)by Dalu [Int. J. Remote Sens. 7 (1986) 1089.] (ii) the ratio of variances by Jedlovec [J. Appl. Meteorol. 29 (1990) 863.], (iii) the regression slope by Goward et al. [Ecol. Appl. 4 (1994) 322,], and (iv) a look-up table derived from radiative transfer model output. Although these techniques were primarily developed to estimate total column precipitable water, we used them to estimate near-surface water vapor, within a few meters of the surface. Near-surface water vapor is needed for hydrologic and biospheric modeling. Analysis showed the total column precipitable water to be highly correlated (r(2) = .79) with near-surface absolute humidity for clear-sky conditions at the BOREAS and the Oklahoma study sites. Correlation of all the retrieval techniques with ground observations was very low. For the split-window approach, water vapor can only be estimated on a per pixel basis and is ambiguous for anything but a single site. The regression slope and variance ratio techniques showed very little correlation with ground observations with r(2) = .02 when compared with data from BOREAS, and .17 for the variance ratio and .24 for the regression slope when compared with Mesonet data. The spatial variability of water vapor across the landscape hampers the use of these contextual approaches. The highest correlation was for the look-up table approach, with r(2) = .36 when compared with data from the BOREAS site. The look-up table was applied using AVHRR Channels 4 and 5 brightness temperatures, surface temperature, and near-surface air temperature. Surface temperature and air temperature were both estimated from the satellite readings. Combining the satellite data with air temperature measured at meteorological ground stations improved the correlation to .50. The relatively low r(2) values were at least partly due to spatial and temporal mismatches between surface and satellite measurements. Simulation of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) thermal Channels 29 (8.4-8.7 mum), 31 (10.78-11.28 mum), and 32 (11.77-12.27 mum) brightness temperatures showed that Channels 31 and 32 provide similar information as AVHRR Channels 4 and 5. The additional thermal information provided by Channel 29 shows promise for future water vapor detection efforts. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Data from 202 forest plots on the Roanoke River floodplain, North Carolina were used to assess the capabilities of multitemporal radar imagery for estimating biophysical characteristics of forested wetlands. The research was designed to determine the potential for using widely available data from the current set of satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors to study forests over broad geographic areas and complex environmental gradients. The SAR data set included 11 Radarsat scenes, 2 ERS-1 images, and 1 JERS-1 scene. Empirical analyses were stratified by flood status such that sites were compared only if they exhibited common flooding characteristics. In general, the results indicate that forest properties are more accurately estimated using data from flooded areas. probably because variations in surface conditions are minimized where there is a continuous surface of standing water. Estimations yielded root mean square errors (RMSEs) for validation data around 10 m(2)/ha for basal area (BA). and less than 3 m for canopy height. The r(2) values generally exceeded .65 for BA, with the best predictions coming from sample sites for which both nonflooded and flooded SAR scenes were available. The addition of early spring normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values from Landsat Thematic Mapper (Landsat TM) improved model predictions for BA in forests where BA levels were <55 m(2)/ha. Further analyses indicated a very limited sensitivity of the individual SAR scenes to differences in forest composition, although soil properties in nonflooded areas exerted a weak but nevertheless important influence on backscatter.

AB Tree height, the height from the ground surface to the tree crown, and the crown length as a proportion of tree height of individual trees were derived from various canopy height metrics measured by a small-footprint airborne laser scanner flown over a boreal forest reserve. The average spacing on the ground of the laser pulses ranged from 0.66 to 1.29 in. Ground-truth values were regressed against laser-derived canopy height metrics. The regressions explained 75%. 53%, and 51% of the variability in ground-truth tree height, height to the crown, and relative crown length, respectively. Cross-validation of the regressions revealed standard deviations of the differences between predicted and ground-truth values of 3.15 in (17.6%) 2.19 m (39.1%), and 10.48% (14.9% of ground-truth mean), respectively. On 10 plots with size 50 m(2) in the boreal forest reserve and on 27 plots with size 200 m(2) in a managed spruce forest, mean tree height, average height from the ground surface to the crown, and average relative crown length were regressed against laser canopy height metrics. The coefficients of determination (R-2) ranged from .47 to .91. Cross-validation revealed a precision of 1.49 m (7.6%), 1.24-1.52 in (20.9-23.3%), and 6.32-7.11% (8.8-10.9% of ground-truth mean) for mean tree height, average height to the crown, and average relative crown length, respectively. At least, mean tree height can be determined more accurately from laser data than by current methods. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Radiometric cross-calibration of the Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-5 TM
   sensors based on tandem data sets
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID THEMATIC MAPPER
AB Early in its mission, the Landsat-7 spacecraft was temporarily placed in a "tandem" orbit very close to that of the Landsat-5 spacecraft in order to facilitate the establishment of sensor calibration continuity between the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) sensors. The key period for the tandem configuration was June 1-4, 1999, during which hundreds of nearly coincident matching scenes were recorded by both the Landsat-7 ETM+ and, in cooperation with Space Imaging/EOSAT and international ground stations, the Landsat-5 TM as well. The paper presents a methodology for radiometric cross-calibration of the solar reflective spectral bands of the Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-5 TM sensors and results based on analysis of two different tandem image pairs for which ground reference data are available. With the well-calibrated ETM+ as a reference, the tandem-based cross-calibrations for the two image pairs yield TM responsivities that are consistent to each other to within 2% or better depending on the spectral band. Comparisons with independent methods and results obtained by other groups indicate that the tandem-based cross-calibration is within 3% of the independent results on average in spectral bands 1-4 but compares less favorably in bands 5 and 7. The present study indicates that the tandem cross-calibration approach can provide a valuable "contemporary" calibration update for Landsat-5 TM in the visible and near-infrared spectral bands based on the excellent radiometric performance of Landsat-7 ETM+. The methodology also incorporates adjustments for spectral band differences between the two Landsat sensors. Spectral band difference effects are shown to be more dependent on the surface reflectance spectrum than on atmospheric and illumination conditions. A variety of terrestrial surfaces are assessed regarding their suitability for Landsat radiometric cross-calibration in the absence of surface reflectance spectra.

ID LANDFALL; WETLANDS; DAMAGE
AB An empirical model was used to relate forest type and hurricane-impact distribution with wind speed and duration to explain the variation of hurricane damage among forest types along the Atchafalaya River basin of coastal Louisiana. Forest-type distribution was derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper image data, hurricane-impact distribution from a suite of transformed advanced very high resolution radiometer images, and wind speed and duration from a wind-field model. The empirical model explained 73%, 84%, and 87% of the impact variances for open, hardwood, and cypress-tupelo forests, respectively. These results showed that the estimated impact for each forest type was highly related to the duration and speed of extreme winds associated with Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The wind-field model projected that the highest wind speeds were in the southern basin, dominated by cypress-tupelo and open forests, while lower wind speeds were in the northern basin, dominated by hardwood forests. This evidence could explain why, on average, the impact to cypress-tupelos was more severe than to hardwoods, even though cypress-tupelos are less susceptible to wind damage. Further, examination of the relative importance of wind speed in explaining the impact severity to each forest type showed that the impact to hardwood forests was mainly related to tropical-depression to tropical-storm force wind speeds. Impacts to cypress-tupelo and open forests (a mixture of willows and cypress-tupelo) were broadly related to tropical-storm force wind speeds and by wind speeds near and somewhat in excess of hurricane force. Decoupling the importance of duration from speed in explaining the impact severity to the forests could not be fully realized. Most evidence, however, hinted that impact severity was positively related to higher durations at critical wind speeds. Wind-speed intervals, which were important in explaining the impact severity on hardwoods, showed that higher durations, but not the highest wind speeds, were concentrated in the northern basin, dominated by hardwoods. The extreme impacts associated with the cypress-tupelo forests in the southeast corner of the basin intersected the highest durations as well as the highest wind speeds.

AB Monitoring vegetation using remote sensing is beset with difficulties. Primary among these are the variations of vegetation reflectance with sun zenith angle, view zenith angle, and terrain slope angle. To provide corrections of these effects, for visible and near-infrared. light, we derive two simple physicial models of vegetation reflectance, both of which have three parameters. The first model, WAK I, is applicable when illumination is by direct light only; and the second model, WAK II, is applicable when illumination is by both diffuse and direct light. The models were tested by fitting them to reflectance data of Virginia pine, irrigated wheat, and alfalfa, at large sun zenith angles, and then comparing predictions of reflectance at small sun zenith angles with measurements. The process was then reversed to do the fitting on the small sun zenith measurements and the prediction of the large sun zenith measurements. Using this method of assessment, the WAK models were found to perform better than several other published models. The WAK models were used to derive a formula for the variation of reflectance with terrain slope angle, which was tested by measuring reflectances of microcanopies set up on different slopes in the laboratory. The formula permits topographic correction of vegetation reflectance without needing to know the bidirectional reflectance factor. The simplicity and robustness of the WAK models make them useful for general correction and calibration of remotely sensed imagery. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The demand for improved information on regional and global fire activity in the context of land use/land cover change, ecosystem disturbance, climate modeling, and natural hazards has increased efforts in recent years to improve earth-observing satellite sensors and associated methods for fire information retrieval. While sensor development has made considerable headway for fire monitoring with the recent launch of Terra in late 1999 and upcoming missions such as bispectral infrared detection (BIRD), FOCUS, and the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS), the retrieval of fire properties from satellite observations remains problematic. Current methods for determining properties of actively burning fires, for example, continue to be based on a simple two-component model developed by Dozier in 1981 [Remote Sens. Environ. 11 (1981) 221.]. Its limitations in terms of reliable operational fire property retrieval have been known for some time, although not examined in derail to date. With new measurements from recently deployed and evolving satellite systems. which offer kev advantages for fire remote sensing, it is appropriate now to more comprehensively examine the heritage methodology for fire property retrieval. The results of a sensitivity analysis indicate that under realistic conditions the random errors in fire temperature and area retrieved using Dozier's method are +/- 100 K and +/- 50% at one standard deviation, respectively, for fires occupying a pixel fraction greater than 0.005 (this corresponds to a 5000-m(2) fire within a 1-km pixel). For smaller active fires, larger random and systematic errors are likely to occur. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Alligator River Region of the Northern Territory, Australia, is identified as a region particularly susceptible to saltwater intrusion into systems dominated by freshwater processes. Attempts have been made by the Parks and Wildlife Commission of the NT to restrict the intrusion by creating physical earth barrages. In this study the use of Airborne Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar for mapping soil salinity is examined. Three dielectric retrieval algorithms, the Small Perturbation, Physical Optics, and Dubois models have been implemented, and the results of these were combined to retrieve an improved estimate of the magnitude of the imaginary part of the complex dielectric constant for soil salinity discrimination. An efficient data selection process was employed to allow application of these models in this natural environment. Vegetation correction to the small perturbation and physical optics models before combination with the Dubois model improved classification accuracy in the semivegetated areas.

AB This paper examines the use of spaceborne radar data 50 map forest types and logging in the mountainous Western Sayani area in central Siberia. L- and C- band HH-, HV-, and VV-polarized images from the Shuttle Imaging Radar-C instrument were used in the study. Techniques to reduce topographic effects in the radar images were investigated. These included radiometric correction using illumination angle inferred from a digital elevation model and reducing apparent effects of topography through band ratios. For-est classification was performed after terrain correction utilizing typical supervised techniques and principal component analyses. An ancillary data set of local elevations was also used to improve the forest classification. Map accuracy for each technique was estimated for training sites based on Russian forestry maps, satellite imagery, and field measurements. The results indicate that it is necessary to correct for topography when attempting to classify forests in mountainous terrain. Radiometric correction based on a digital elevation model improved classification results brit required reducing the synthetic aperture radar resolution, to match the digital elevation model. Using ratios of synthetic aperture radar channels that include cross-polarization improved classification and had the advantages of eliminating the need for a digital elevation model and preserving the full resolution of the synthetic aperture radar data.

AB Existing algorithms for retrieving snow water equivalent (SWE) from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave brightness temperature data were assessed and new algorithms that include physiographic and atmospheric data were developed for the Red River basin of North Dakota and Minnesota. The frequencies of SSM/I data used are 19 GHz and 37 GHz in both horizontal and vertical polarization. Encouraging calibration results are obtained for the algorithms using multivariate regression technique and dry snow cases of the 1989 and 1988 SSM/I data (from DMSP-F8). Similarly, validation results for data not used in calibration [e.g., 1988 (1989 as calibration data), 1989 (1988 as calibration data), and 1997 (from DMSP-F10 and F13)] are also encouraging. The nonparametric, Projection Pursuit Regression (PPR) technique also gave good results in both stages. However, for the validation stage, adding a shift parameter to all retrieval algorithms was always necessary, possibly because of different scatter-induced darkening (caused by scattering albedo), which could arise even for snowpacks of the same thickness because snowpacks undergo different metamorphism in different winter years. Screening criteria are also proposed to eliminate SSM/I footprints affected by large water bodies and depth-hoar-another key step toward reliable SWE estimation from passive microwave data.

ID AEROSOLS; EXTINCTION
AB Automatic globally distributed networks for monitoring aerosol optical depth provide measurements of natural and anthropogenic aerosol loading, which is important in many local and regional studies as well as global change research investigations. The strength of such networks relies on imposing a standardization of measurement and processing, allowing multiyear and large-scale comparisons. The development of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) for systematic ground-based sunphotometer measurements of aerosol optical depth is an essential and evolving step in this process. The growing database requires the development of a consistent, reproducible, and system-wide cloud-screening procedure. This paper discusses the methodology and justification of the cloud-screening algorithm developed for the AERONET database. The procedure has been comprehensively tested on experimental data obtained in different geographical and optical conditions. These conditions include biomass burning events in Brazil and Zambia, hazy summer conditions in the Washington DC area, clean air advected from the Canadian Arctic, and variable cloudy conditions. For various sites our screening algorithm eliminates from similar to 20% to 50% of the initial data depending on cloud conditions. Certain shortcomings of the proposed procedure are discussed.

AB A new empirical multiparame Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) retrieval algorithm based on the neural network approach, which retrieves wind speed, columnar renter vapor and columnar liquid water simultaneously using only SSM/I brightness temperatures, is compared with existing global SSM/I refrieoal algorithms. In terms of wind speed retrieval accuracy, the were algorithm systematically outperforms all algorithms considered under all weather conditions where retrievals are possible with an algorithm rms error of 1.0 m/s under clear and 1.3 m/s tinder clear plus cloudy conditions. It also generates high wind speeds with acceptable accuracy. This improvement in accuracy is coupled with increased areal coverage rc;ith obvious benefits for operational applications. With respect to columnar water vapor and columnar liquid water, the new algorithm reproduces the results of existing algorithms closely. The new algorithm has been tested and accepted for operational use at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) producing a positive impact on forecast winds through assimilation into NCEP's numerical weather prediction models.

ID WIND SCATTEROMETER; ENHANCEMENT; VEGETATION; SURFACES
AB Multiplicative Wiener deconvolution has been applied to ERS scatterometer measurements obtained over land with the aim of improving their spatial resolution. The ERS scatterometer teas launched to provide high-accuracy radar backscattering measurements over the sea surface for the purpose of monitoring marine wind velocity However, ERS scatterometer data soon inspired an increasing interest for land and sea ice monitoring. The main shortcoming of these applications has been the coarse resolution of the device. This varies between 25 km(2) and 46 km(2) before ground processing, which results in normalization dozen to similar to 48 km(2) so that all the measurements can be used jointly in the wind vector retrieval . Nevertheless, for the case of perdurable sea ice and land scenes, measurements with 25-km resolution before ground processing can be selected to form images. As will be shown here, this finer resolution can be recovered for these images by using a linear Wiener filter. This restoration technique teas tested on a large scene from Russia. The improvement can be observed in the definition of the line of the river of the basin. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB This study investigates the relationships between the spectral reflectance characteristics and the concentrations of photosynthetic pigments and biophysical attributes of a structurally complex spatially heterogeneous vegetation canopy with varying background properties. A field experiment was performed in the Guadalentin basin, Spain using matorral vegetation canopies dominated by Rosmarinus officinalis, Cistus albidus, and Anthyllis cytosoides. A spectroradiometer was used to record the reflectance of a series of sites at which measurements were made of the concentrations per unit ground area and per unit leaf mass of chlorophyll a and b and the carotenoids, together with leaf area index and percent canopy cover A range of spectral characteristics was examined which have been found previously to be related to pigment concentrations and biophysical properties of vegetation. For matorral vegetation many of these spectral characteristics were unrelated or only weakly related to canopy properties. However, if was found that pigment concentrations per unit ground area were related to ratios of reflectance iii narrow spectral bands within the near-infrared region, ratios of bands within the red region, and characteristics of the amplitude of first derivative spectra in the red edge region. Pigment concentrations per unit leaf mass were correlated with ratios of bands around the near-infrared "shoulder" and the amplitude of the first derivative in certain visible wavelengths. LAI and percent cover were related to ratios of reflectance in narrow bands on the near-infrared plateau and red edge features of canopy reflectance spectra, as well as with the amplitude of the first derivative in the red edge and visible regions respectively.

AB Two radiative transfer models have been coupled to generate vegetation canopy reflectance as a function of leaf chemistry, leaf morphology (as represented by leaf scattering properties), leaf thickness, soil reflectance, and canopy architecture. A model of radiative transfer within a leaf, called LEAFMOD, treats the radiative transfer equation for a slab of optically uniform leaf material, providing an estimate of leaf hemispherical reflectance and transmittance as well as the radiance exiting the leaf surfaces. The canopy model then simulates radiative transfer within a mixture of leaves, with each having uniform optical properties as determined by LEAFMOD, assuming a bi-Lambertian leaf scattering phase function. The utility of the model, called LCM2 (Leaf/Canopy Model version 2), is demonstrated through predictions of radiometric measurements of canopy reflectance and sensitivity to leaf chlorophyll and moisture content.

AB An exploratory study of the variance of the bidirectional reflectance over discontinuous plant canopies indicates that the patterns in variance can be related to the properties of the plant canopies. The spatial variance of the bidirectional reflectance calculated from ASAS images shows peak values at the hotspot and near nadir This behavior can be explained by the geometric effect of discontinuous tr-es crowns and the regularization effect. Validation of Jupp and Woodcock's two-component geometric optical (GO) model (1992) shows that ii captures the basic features of the spatial variance of the bidirectional reflectance over discontinuous plant canopies. Their two-component GO model is modified to account for the spatial interactions of four scene components. Validation shows that the modified GO model improves predictions. This exploratory study will benefit future use of directional imagery to recover surface parameters by helping characterize the distributional properties of directional imagery (C) Elsevier Science Inc.

ID SNOW; SCATTERING; ICE
AB In this article, a backscatter theory for an electrically dense medium is presented. The random medium is modeled by a layer of randomly distributed dielectric spherical scatters, bounded on top and bottom by a rough surface. The phase matrix for the discrete spherical scatterers is evaluated using the dense medium phase and amplitude correction (DM-PACT) method (Chuah et. al., 1996) so that it can be used for a dense medium (such as snow and sea-ice). This phase matrix differs from the conventional one in that both amplitude and phase corrections for the close-spacing effect are considered. The rough surface is modeled using the integral equation method (IEM) (Fing, 1994). The problem is formulated by using radiative transfer theory. The integrodifferential equations are solved using an iterative method. Explicit expressions up to second-order solutions are given. Based on these solutions, terms resulting from three major scattering mechanisms, namely, direct surface-volume, and volume scattering terms, can be identified. The volume interactions include both direct volume and volume-volume interactions. Using this model, dense medium effect and relative contributions of the three major scattering mechanisms are investigated. The study of relative contributions of the various scattering mechanisms is important to indicate the conditions under which a simple incoherent theory, where backscatter returns are obtained by direct addition of volume and direct surface terms, is acceptable. Comparisons are also made with measurements in the laboratory and in the field. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB Time-integrated normalized difference vegetation index (TI NDVI) derived from the multitemporal satellite imagery (1989-1993) was used as a surrogate for primary production to investigate climate impacts on grassland performance for central and Northern Great Plains grasslands. Results suggest that spatial and temporal variability in growing season precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and growing degree days are the most important controls on grassland performance and productivity. When TI NDVI and climate data of all grassland land cover classes were examined as a whole, a statistical model showed significant positive correlation between the TI NDVI and accumulated spring and summer precipitation, and a negative correlation between TI NDVI and spring potential evapotranspiration. The coefficient of determination (R-2) of the general model was 0.45. When the TI NDVI-climate relationship was examined by individual land cover type, the relationship was generally better defined in terms of the variance accounted for by class-specific models (R-2 = 0.39-0.94). The photosynthetic pathway is an important determinant of grassland performance with northern mixed prairie (mixture of C-3 and C-4 grassland) TI NDVI affected by both thermal and moisture conditions during the growing season while southern plains grasslands (primarily C-4 grassland) were predominantly influenced by spring and summer precipitation. Grassland land cover classes associated with sandy soils also demonstrated a strong relationship between TI NDVI and growing season rainfall. Significant impact of interannual climate variability on the TI NDVI-climate relationship was also observed. The study suggests an integrated approach involving numerical models, satellite remote sensing, and field observations to monitor grassland ecosystem dynamics on a regional scale.

AB A dual-source model treating the energy balance of the soil/substrate and vegetation that was developed to use radiometric diometric surface temperature observations is revised to use remotely sensed near-surface moisture from a passive microwave sensor for estimating the soil surface energy balance. With remotely sensed images of near-surface soil moisture, land cover classification, and leaf area index, the model is applied over a semiarid area in the Walnut Gulch Watershed in southern Arizona. The spatial and temporal variation of the Bowen ratio (i.e., the ratio of the turbulent fluxes, sensible, and Intent heat) "maps" generated by the model ere similar to the changes in near-surface moisture fields caused by recent precipitation events in the study area. The estimated fluxes at the time of the microwave observations (i.e., "instantaneous" estimates) and those simulated over the daytime period are compared with the ground observations within the watershed. Differences between predicted and observed "instantaneous" fluxes were usually comparable to the measurement uncertainties, namely, 5% for net radiation and 20-30% for soil, sensible and latent heat fluxes, except when there was large temporal and spatial variations in solar radiation across the study area. However by running the model over the daytime period, this variability in solar radiation proved to have a minor effect on computed daytime totals. In fact, differences with observed heat fluxes were significantly less (i.e., around 15%) than when comparing "instantaneous" values. Model predictions of the total soil heat flux over the daytime period were generally higher than measured. An empirical model was developed to reduce this bias, but it is not known how generally applicable it will be. Model sensitivity to typical uncertainties in remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) and near-surface (0-5 cm) water col?tent, W was quantified. The variation in flux predictions caused by errors in prescribing leaf area index and W was less than 30%. More tests with this model over different landscapes are necessary to evaluate its potential for predicting,a regional fluxes, lit particular, microwave and radiometric surface temperature observations are needed under drought conditions for evaluating if the model formulation of vegetation transpiration can properly adjust to this extreme and very important environmental condition.

AB In situ hyperspectral data measured above sunlit and shaded sides of canopies using a high spectral resolution radiometer were analyzed for identification of six conifer tree species. An artificial neural network algorithm was assessed for the identification purpose. Linear discriminant analysis was compared with the neural network algorithm. The hyperspectral data were further processed to smoothed reflectances and first derivative spectra and were separately used in tree species identification. Tree species recognition with data collected from six study sites was tested in seven experiments. The average accuracy of species recognition was obtained at every site. The overall performance of the neural network algorithm was better than that of linear discriminant analysis for species recognition when the same number of training samples and test samples were used. The discriminant analysis produced better accuracy than neural network at one site where many samples (10) were taken from six individual trees. Use of the average spectra of all samples for a particular tree species in training may not result in higher accuracy than use of individual spectral samples in training. Use of sunlit samples alone resulted in an overall accuracy of greater than 91%. The effects of site background including illuminating conditions on tree species spectra were large. Neural networks are sensitive to subtle spectral details and can be trained to separate samples from the same species at different sites. Our experiments indicate that the discriminating power of visible bands is stronger than that of near-infrared bands. Higher recognition accuracies can be obtained in the blue to green or the red-edge spectral region as compared with four other spectral regions. A smaller set of selected bands can generate more accurate identification than all spectral bands. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The aim of this work consists of monitoring the recovery process after five by means of satellite imagery. The objectives are to assess the regrowth pathways followed by different species populations after a disturbance, to analyze the speed of recovery in the years following fire, and, finally, to estimate rates of regrowth. The test area is located in the north of the province of Alicante, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. This area, especially prone to forest fires, shows a remarkable land-use history and human pressure. The test areas belong to different microclimatic zones, show diverse vegetation communities, and have different degrees of stoniness; so we attempted to discover their postfire behaviors according to their biogeographical conditions. To accomplish these objectives, we used nine Landsat 5 thematic mapper images from 1984 to 1994 to which geometric and radiometric corrections were applied. Once the comparability between images was guaranteed, we generated a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for each date. First, we demonstrated that the differences between NDVI images were suitable for mapping burned areas. Second, we undertook a nonlinear regression analysis between NDVI values and the time elapsed since the fire to assess the recovery processes. The exponential adjustment between NDVI and time was in accord with the asymptotic behavior observed when the recovery process is complete. The parameters supplied by the proposed method are helpful in quantifying the effects of fire on different ecosystem processes. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Leaf (PROSPECT), soil, canopy (SAIL), and atmosphere (6S) models were coupled and used to create a large set of simulated reflectance spectra with corresponding water content per unit leaf area (C-w) dry matter content per unit leaf area (SLW; i.e., the specific leaf weight), leaf area index (LAI), whole canopy water content (C-w,LAI), and whole canopy dry matter col?rent (SLW.LAI). Multiple linear regression was used to estimate these canopy variables from the simulated satellite reflectance spectra within the 880-2380-nm domain. Our data set was subdivided into calibration and validation subsets to evaluate the predictive power of the relations. Canopy-level variables (C-w.LAI,SLW.LAI,LAI) were retrieved with a good accuracy, whereas leaf-level variables (C-w,SLW) were less accurately retrieved. The radiometric resolution of the simulated sensor greatly affected the accuracy of the estimation. Conversely the spectral resolution between 10 and 20 nm was not critical, the largest spectral resolution providing the most accurate estimates because it smoothed the instrument noise. We used multiple linear regression to select between five and eight wave bands for each canopy variable. Several wave bands selected were common to different canopy variables. Therefore, a set of ten wavebands centered on about 890, 1080, 1210, 1290, 1535, 1705, 2035, 2205, 2260, and 2295 nm efficiently allowed reasonable estimates of the variables investigated with varying coefficients for each of the canopy variables. For each variable, neural networks were trained over the wave bands selected by the multiple regression. Results showed better performances than classical multiple linear regression. Shifting the on wave bands by 10 or 20 nm when calibrating and testing the networks slightly decreased the accuracy of the estimation. The difference was more pronounced for C-w, and SLW. Conversely, When equations were generated with the use of the wave bands at their optimal position and validated by using wave bands shifted by 10 or 20 nm, the accuracy of estimation for all variables except LAI was low. These results are discussed with emphasis on the design of future sensors. (C) Elsevier Science Inc, 1997.

AB Sensors on satellite platforms with extreme view angles have been increasingly used to analyze regional and global vegetation cover and productivity because of frequent observations. This study, using experimental and theoretical methods, analyzed variations in vegetation indices with sun-view geometry as a means of understanding the sensitivity of relations between vegetation indices and the biophysical properties, the leaf area index (LAI), and the instantaneous fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR). Canopy bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) of an alfalfa crop were measured and simulated at a variety of solar and view zenith angles. Also, fAPAR, LAI, and leaf optical properties were measured. Measured and simulated canopy reflectances agreed generally within 1% (absolute). Normalized difference and simple ratio vegetation indices (NDVI and SRVI, respectively), derived from BRFs, varied with view and solar zenith angles. The minimum for near-infrared (NIR) BRFs and relatively high red BRFs generally occurred near nadir, resulting in some of the lowest vegetation index values. Highest VI values were generally obtained at forward view angles. Variation of NDVI with sun-view-geometry was greatest at LAIs <2, whereas the range in SRVI was greatest for LAIs>2. Measured reflectances indicate that relations between NDVI and LAI and between SRVI and fAPAR were curvilinear across all solar and view zenith angle combinations in the solar principal plane, whereas relations between SRVI and LAI and between NDVI and fAPAR varied from linear to curvilinear. Analyses revealed that vegetation indices at large view zenith angles were poorly correlated with fAPAR, whereas those at small zenith angles were strongly correlated. In general, vegetation indices were more sensitive to fAPAR than to LAI, which is attributed to the fact that fAPAR is a radiation quantity, whereas LAI is nonlinearly related to radiation. Regression of fAPAR with VI values derived from combinations of red and NIR BRFs from similar and nonsimilar directions indicates that the highest correlation is in near-nadir and backscatter directions. However, further investigation into variations of relations between remotely sensed observations and canopy attributes and into the usefulness of off-nadir in extracting information is recommended.

ID LANDERS EARTHQUAKE
AB Aufeis deposits from every year on many river on the North Slope of Alaska; and, through repeated episodes of overflow and freezing, they may reach a thickness of more than 3 m. The presence of aufeis in a drainage basin tends to stabilize river discharge in the same way as a glacier does, by providing melt water during hot dry periods. This distribution of aufeis deposits along the rivers is discontinuous because of variations in channel geometry and under-ice water supply, and monitoring their growth during the winter is generally impractical. However, experiments using satellite radar interferometry (SRI) to map changes in the extent of aufeis near the junction of the Ivishak and the Echooka Rivers in the northern Brooks Range during the winter have produced promising results. Interferograms of the area were made from pairs of images acquired by the European Space Agency's First Earth Remote Sensing Satellite in January through March 1994. The results indicate that aufeis deposits can be mapped on interferograms as areas it river valleys in which the radar phases are poorly correlated and radar backscatter values frequently change. The ability of SRI in monitoring subtle winter aufeis processes fills a major gap in the study of aufeis by remote sensing. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Linear spectral mixture analysis can be used to model the spectral variability In multi- or hyperspectral images and to relate the results to the physical abundance of surface constituents represented by the spectral endmembers. The most difficult step in this analytical approach lies in the selection of spectral endmembers, which are chosen to represent surface components. A new approach to endmember selection is presented here, which may be used to augment existing methods, in which the endmembers are derived mathematically from the image data subject to a set of user-defined constraints. The constraints take the form of a starting model and allowable deviations from that starting model, which incorporate anl a priori knowledge of the data and physical properties of the scene. These constraints are applied to the basic mixing equations, which are then solved iteratively to derive a set of spectral endmembers that minimize the residual error. Because the input to the model is quantitative, the derivation process is repeatable, and endmembers derived with different sets of constraints may be compared to each other directly. Three examples are presented, in which spectral endmembers are derived according to this model for a series of Images: a synthetic image cube whose endmembers are already known, a natural terrestrial scene, and a natural lunar scene. Detailed analysis of the model inputs and results reveal that this modified approach to endmember selection provides physically realistic spectral endmembers that in many cases represent purer components than could be found in arty pixel in the image scene.

AB In this study, optical and microwave remote sensing data were used in combination for crop growth monitoring. A simple reflectance model was used for estimating Leaf area index (LAI) from optical data, and a simple backscatter model was used for estimating LAI from radar data. Subsequently, the synergistic effect of using both optical and radar data for estimating LAI was analyzed by studying different data acquisition scenarios. Finally, the remote sensing models were inverted to obtain LAI estimates during the growing season for use in calibrating the crop growth model to actual growing conditions. This concept for crop growth monitoring is elucidated and illustrated with examples using ground-based and airborne data obtained during the MAC Europe 1991 campaign. Results showed that simultaneous optical and radar observations did not improve estimates of LAI over optical data alone. However, for operational applications the assumption of nonsimultaneous observations is more realistic. Results for sugar beet indicated that when periodic (about every ten clays) optical recordings are available throughout most of the growing season, LAI can be monitored well and a good estimate of sugar beet yield at the end of the season is possible by using a calibrated crop growth model. When only a few recording dates with an optical sensor are available, radar recordings at L-band HH polarization or C-band VV polarization gave a slight improvement of the results of crop monitoring and yield estimation compared with the optical data alone. In the absence of optical remote sensing data, radar data yielded a significant improvement in yield estimation compared with the case of no remotely observed information. This confirmed that the main advantage of radar lies in acquiring information on crop growth when other techniques (in particular optical techniques) fail.

AB Linear miring models are widely used in terrestrial remote sensing, with the errors in these models being often attributed to ''nonlinear'' mixing. Nonlinear mixing refers to the interaction of light with multiple target materials. Reflectance data from creosote bush in the Manix Basin of the Mojave Desert is used to show the existence and importance of nonlinear mixing in arid region vegetation. It shows that the difference in the reflectance spectrum of plants against a soil background and the spectrum of the plant against a dark background is well represented by light that has interacted with both the soil and the plant.

AB We assess the validity of the ''independent pixel approximation'' (IPA) using Monte Carlo simulations of realistic scale-invariant clouds modeled with 2-D horizontal variations in optical depth.  The IPA uses a plane-parallel approximation for each pixel, and is used in virtually all cloud remote sensing algorithms.  We confirm the validity of the IPA at the largest scales and demonstrate its shortcomings on the smallest scales:  a)  It overestimates the variability of the radiation field when the optical depth field is known, and b) it underestimates the variability of the optical depth field when the radiation field is known.  Both effects are due to smoothing by horizontal fluxes.

To accomplish this, an experiment was conducted in Phoenix, Arizona, over plots of bare soil and low, medium, and high alfalfa Reflectances were measured from 0.4 mu m to 1.0 mu m in nine view angles (from - 40 degrees to + 40 degrees, in 10 degrees steps) over varying solar zenith angles. This was done simultaneously with fAPAR measurements. Changes in view angle caused variations in the indices to be as high as 50% in relation to nadir. However, there was an opposite view angle behavior between NDVI and SAVI, with the former Increasing from antisolar to forward scattering view direction. A derivative analysis of the indices showed the SAVI to exhibit a more linear relationship than NDVI with the individual bands, The relationships between both Vis and fAPAR were, in general, linear. However view angle variations perturbed these relationships and caused an over- or underestimation of fAPAR, depending on view direction (antisolar or forward), view angle, and vegetation index (NDVI or SAVI).

AB This article presents a detailed theoretical model for propagation of microwave in a layer of vegetation medium. The vegetation medium is modeled by a layer of randomly distributed dielectric circular disks and cylinders, representing the leaves and the stems, respectively. Propagation of wave in such a medium is taken as a transport of energy problem, and is formulated by a Monte Carlo method. Interactions of wave with the vegetation components are treated as a sequence of multiple scattering events between the photon flux and the scatterers. A Monte Carlo algorithm is used to track these collision processes, and the energy of the photon leaving the vegetation layer is collected. With sufficient number of photon histories, the ensemble averages of the photon energy are used to calculate the attenuation coefficients of the wave through vegetation layer. Our simulation results indicate that attenuation coefficients calculated using this multiple scattering model may differ from those given by a simple single scattering model. Effects on the attenuation coefficients by various parameters such as moisture content, scatterer's size, and volume fraction are studied. Comparisons of the calculated results are made with the measured data and good match is obtained.

TI WATER-SURFACE TEMPERATURE CHARACTERISTICS AND THERMAL BAR EVOLUTION
   DURING SPRING IN LAKE LADOGA

LA English
DT Article
ID SATELLITE
AB The present article is a study of the surface temperature distribution and its evolution during spring in Lake Ladoga, using NOAA-AVHRR Channel 4/Channel 5 (CH4/CH5) data, with special focus on a thermohydrodynamic phenomenon, called thermal bar. The split-window technique, where both constant and atmospheric-mass-dependent retrieval coefficients are tested, is used for calculating the atmosphere effects in the temperature derivation. The satellite-derived temperature data are compared with field data from six different years. The results show that on average, the satellite-derived temperatures exceed the in situ data by approximately 0.5-degrees-C. The relative advantages of images from day or night passes for the study of the thermal bar is also discussed. Surface temperature differences in the convectively mixed region (temperatures less than 4-degrees-C) show that day temperatures are on the order of 0.5-degrees-C higher than the night temperatures. However, the surface temperatures from day images seem to be more representative of the bulk temperature in a water column. A comparison of the thermal bar progression in Lake Ladoga during spring 1988 as obtained from satellite images and as predicted by a simple theoretical model shows good agreement. This result and results from an earlier study indicate that the model is a good prediction tool for thermal bar movement in large temperate lakes.

AB A simplified model for radiometric corrections has been used to improve nonsupervised classification of vegetation cover in a hilly area near Barcelona, Spain. A digital elevation model and standard parameters for exoatmospheric solar irradiance, atmospheric optical depth, and sensor calibration are the only inputs required. Radiometric classes obtained by cluster classification of Landsat TM images from nonradiometrically corrected images include several classes related to terrain illumination, but not to vegetation or thematic cover differences. The use of radiometric correction allows identifying all radiometric classes obtained as vegetation or thematic classes with 83.3% global accuracy. Classes obtained include Pinus halepensis, Quercus ilex, and Quercus cerrioides forests, shrublands, grasslands, urban areas with vegetation, urban areas without vegetation, and denuded areas. Radiometric correction helps in estimating surfaces and spectral features of these classes. The results are discussed considering botanical composition, date (phenology), and vegetation dynamics.

AB Understanding the bidirectional reflectance characteristics of forest canopies is important for relating remote sensing observations to biomass, species, stand structure, and albedo. studies of the directional scattering of forest canopies have been limited in the past because of difficulties in suspending instruments over tall canopies or by being restricted to airborne scanning systems. In this article we discuss the use of the Advanced Solid-State Array Spectroradiometer (ASAS) to measure the bidirectional reflectance of several diverse forest canopies. ASAS data were acquired in 1989 and 1990 as part Of an extensive field measurement campaign at International Paper's Northern Experimental Forest (NEF) located near Howland, Maine. Multiangle data sets were acquired for several sites under clear sky conditions and at view azimuths parallel, oblique, and perpendicular to the principal plane of the sun. The sensor radiance data for several surface types including forest stands and openings were converted to bidirectional reflectance using an atmospheric correction algorithm and optical thickness measurements. In addition, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) hemispherical reflectance (albedo) was calculated from the corrected ASAS data and compared to a vegetation index. Highest observed reflectance factors were recorded in or near the solar principal plane at viewing geometries approaching the antisolar direction. Minimum reflectances were also observed in the solar principal plane, but in the forward scattered direction. Bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) acquired in the backscatter direction at visible wavelengths showed larger percent differences between viewing angles of 45-degrees in the forward and backscattered direction (up to 95%) than near-IR data (up to 60%). The normalized vegetation index (NDVI) also varied with view angle but to a lesser degree than single-band BRFs. Also in contrast to single-band BRFs, maximum NDVI was recorded in the forward scattered direction and minimum NDVI was observed in the backscattered direction. Estimated fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation F(APAR) was determined from the hemispherical PAR reflectance for several canopy types within the forest area. Examining the relationships with NDVI revealed a strong dependence of NDVI on F(APAR) for nadir and 450 forward scattered data. A poor relationship was observed for data acquired at 45-degrees in the backscattered direction and for NDVI derived from hemispherical reflectance. From these results, it is apparent that the sensor viewing geometry that minimizes the contribution of reflectance from branches and the ground will yield higher relationships between F(APAR) and NDVI.

AB An extension to a forest canopy thermal radiance model is described that computes the short-wave energy flux absorbed within the canopy by solving simplified radiosity equations describing flux transfers between canopy ensemble classes partitioned by vegetation layer and leaf slope. Integrated short-wave reflectance and transmittance factors obtained from measured leaf optical properties were found to be nearly equal for the canopy studied. Short-wave view factor matrices were approximated by combining the average leaf scattering coefficient with the long-wave view factor matrices already incorporated in the model. Both the updated and original models were evaluated for a dense spruce-fir forest study site in Central Maine. Canopy short-wave absorption coefficients estimated from detailed Monte Carlo ray tracing calculations were 0.60, 0.04, and 0.03 for the top, middle, and lower canopy layers corresponding to leaf area indices of 4.0, 1.05, and 0.25. The simplified radiosity technique yielded analogous absorption values of 0.55, 0.03, and 0.01. The resulting root mean square error in modeled versus measured canopy temperatures for all layers was less than 1-degrees-C with either technique. Maximum error in predicted temperature using the simplified radiosity technique was approximately 2-degrees-C during peak solar heating.

AB Light-induced chlorophyll fluorescence has become a tool which has ever-increasing potential application to experimental plant physiology. The effects of frost, heat, and drought have been analyzed using the kinetics Of individual leaves of two representative types of life form: an evergreen tree (holm oak) dominant in the Mediterranean Basin and an annual cultivated legume (soybean). Various indices were used to quantify their response to environmental stress. Canopy fluorescence for the two types of plants was simulated. For two levels of measurement, leaf or canopy, light-induced fluorescence appears to be helpful for forest or crop management in the Mediterranean area.

TI EFFECT OF DIFFUSE IRRADIANCE ON THE REFLECTANCE FACTOR OF REFERENCE
   PANELS UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID MEASUREMENT ERRORS; CALIBRATION
AB Reference panels for field reflectance factor measurements are not perfect lambertian diffusers, thus it is necessary to correct for this effect. The usual procedure consists of introducing a directional correction depending on the sun zenith angle without considering the diffuse irradiance. In this article, the effect of diffuse irradiance on the apparent reflectance factor of a reference panel is analyzed. The method used is based on the simulation of the directional distribution of diffuse irradiance according to a simplified radiative transfer model (five different atmospheric conditions and 16 sun zenith angles for three different panels). The analysis shows that the relative error for the reflectance factor of a panel can reach 10 % if the diffuse irradiance effect is neglected. A high accuracy simplified method is proposed for correcting for this effect, which takes into account the fraction of diffuse irradiance and its nonisotropic distribution. With this correction, the residual error on the panel reflectance factor is estimated to vary between 0.4 % and 1.0 % in the worst cases.

AB A temporal sequence of 15 SPOT HRV images and low altitude aircraft reflectance data were obtained over soil and cotton fields at the Maricopa Agricultural Center, Arizona from April to October 1989. The SPOT data included different view angles (- 28-degrees - + 24-degrees) while the aircraft data were obtained with a nadir-viewing radiometer equipped with SPOT filters. View angle/direction, atmosphere, and soil influences on individual band and vegetation indices were observed in the SPOT data. The relative magnitude among the three influences was dependent on surface conditions, varied with canopy growth, and was different for red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectances and vegetation indices (VIs). View angle. effects were most pronounced in red and NIR reflectance data and were secondary with the use of VIs. View angle variations, and to some extent soil variations, influenced VI responses from partial canopies while relative atmospheric influences became most dominant at higher densities of vegetation. The results suggest that the current compositing routine for temporal vegetation index imagery may not be entirely adequate.

AB Remote sensing of forest biophysical properties has concentrated upon forest sites with a wide range of green vegetation amount and thereby leaf area index and canopy cover. However, coniferous forest plantations, an important forest type in Europe, are managed to maintain a large amount of green vegetation with little spatial variation. Therefore, the strength of the remotely sensed signal will, it is hypothesized, be determined more by the structure of this forest than by its cover. Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) and SPOT-1 HRV data were used to determine the effects of this structural variation on the remotely sensed response of a coniferous forest plantation in the United Kingdom. Red and near infrared radiance were strongly and negatively correlated with a range of structural properties and with the age of the stands but weakly correlated with canopy cover. A composite variable, related to the volume of the canopy, accounted for over 75% of the variation in near infrared radiance. A simple model that related forest structural variables to the remotely sensed response was used to understand and explain this response from a coniferous forest plantation.

TI SPECTRAL RATIO METHOD FOR MEASURING EMISSIVITY
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The spectral ratio method is based on the concept that although the spectral radiances are very sensitive to small changes in temperature the ratios are not. Only an approximate estimate of temperature is required thus, for example, we can determine the emissivity ratio to an accuracy of 1 % with a temperature estimate that is only accurate to 12.5 K. Selecting the maximum value of the channel brightness temperatures is an unbiased estimate. Laboratory and field spectral data are easily converted into spectral ratio plots. The ratio method is limited by system signal:noise and spectral bandwidth. The images can appear quite noisy because ratios enhance high frequencies and may require spatial filtering. Atmospheric effects tend to rescale the ratios and require using an atmospheric model or a calibration site.

AB Physically based mathematical models of the bidirectional reflectance of terrestrial surfaces are needed to compute the albedo of these surfaces. Such models are also necessary to interpret satellite remote sensing data. in terms of the fundamental physical parameters of the soil and vegetation which control how radiation is reflected by these media. Since a wide variety of mathematical functions can be made to fit the observed reflectances, a clear and discriminating strategy must be thought out to validate the proposed models. Such a strategy consists in inverting the models against reflectance data, and comparing the retrieved values of the parameters to those obtained independently from field or laboratory measurements. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art in modeling the bidirectional reflectance of natural surfaces, describe how such models can be validated, and highlight the remaining challenges for the remote sensing community.

TI OBSERVATIONS OF SNOW AND ICE FEATURES DURING THE POLAR WINTER USING
   MOONLIGHT AS A SOURCE OF ILLUMINATION
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Sunlight reflected off the surface of the moon provides sufficient illumination for nighttime imaging of the earth from those spacecraft on which the instruments are sensitive to low light levels.  The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) series of satellites are at present the only systems capable of furnishing visible nocturnal images of the earth from space.  Features having a high albedo in the visible wavelengths, such as snow and ice, can easily be identified on moonlit nights when the moon is in the gibbous or full phases.  Little information exists about the distribution of leads, fractures, and polynya on a basin-wide scale in the winter pack ice, and knowledge of oceanic and atmospheric fluxes is hindered by the limited data available in winter.  The DMSP data is a relatively untapped source for observing polar regions during the winter.  Using nighttime imagery is a novel way to explore polar areas during the winter months when the sun is below the horizon for much of the time.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID CANOPY
AB The radiosity method is a mathematical concept to describe the scattering of light between ideally diffuse (Lambertian) surfaces.  The method presented takes reflections, transmission, and multiple scattering into account.  Algorithms to find view factors and to solve the radiosity equations using the Gauss - Seidel iteration method are described.  An example for a layered plant canopy model shows the relation between the radiosity method and radiative transfer.  The application of the radiosity method to remote sensing problems of 3-D surfaces, e.g., calculation of a BRDF including internal shadowing effects is shown.  Numerical results of radiosity calculations are compared with equivalent radiative transfer results.  We conclude that the radiosity method is a valuable tool to model the transport of light in vegetative canopies as well as a tool to evaluate bidirectional reflectance characteristics of discrete leaf canopy structures, such as angular reflectance signatures.

   TEMPERATURE; RESPONSES; BALANCE; PLANT
AB Measurements of evapotranspiration and radiometric surface temperature, supplemented by model simulations, illustrate the effect of transient water stress on the evapotranspiration and radiometric surface temperatures over a corn (Zea Mays L) canopy.  Transient stress is manifested by a plateau in the evapotranspiration and a warmer radiometric temperature of the canopy.  Model simulations suggest that the cause of the evapotranspiration plateau is not solely due to reduced soil water content but to excessive atmospheric demand in the face of internal plant constraints.  One of these constraints is a threshold epidermal leaf water potential, below which stomatal resistance increases very rapidly with decreasing leaf water potential.  Accordingly the evapotranspiration plateau can occur at relatively high soil water content.
   The sensitivity of the canopy temperature to changing soil water content is weak at high soil water content.  The evapotranspiration plateau and its effect on radiometric surface temperatures would not be detectable until, in this case, the soil water content decreases to about half of field capacity.  Since evapotranspiration collapse (wilting) would occur at about 35% of field capacity, it may be possible to remotely monitor the onset of crop water stress over dense vegetation before catastrophic damage occurs.

AB The objectives of this study were to analyze the relationship between the AVHRR data [transformed into a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)] and ecological variables and, secondly, to evaluate the possibility of estimating actual evapotranspiration using AVHRR and other readily available data.  The study was undertaken across a range of conditions in Canada.  Meteorological and composited NDVI data were compiled for 15-day periods over the 1986 growing season and were supplemented by digital ecological and soil data.  The effect of soil and meteorological conditions on vegetation growth was modeled using the Versatile Soil Moisture Budget model, which accounts for additions and losses of water from various layers in the root zone.  The various data sets were integrated using a geographic information system.  We found that individual vegetation / soil combinations exhibited different NDVI trajectories, most closely related to the trends in potential evapotranspiration.  There was a highly significant association between coincident NDVI and actual evapotranspiration values (r = 0.77) or between NDVI and potential evapotranspiration for the previous 15-day period (r = 0.86).  High correlation was found between cumulative NDVI and cumulative actual evapotranspiration over the growing season (r = 0.96).  Actual evapotranspiration for individual 15-day periods could be estimated from NDVI and potential evapotranspiration values with a residual error of about 10-15%.  The results show that the NDVI trajectories provide important information on the seasonal development of vegetation at northern latitudes.  Results in estimating actual evapotranspiration were also encouraging but further work is needed to determine the accuracy limits for this geographic area.  The representativeness of the 1986 results for the region is subject of continuing study with 6 years of NDVI data.

AB The optical-reflective radiative transfer characteristics of three conifer species [Norway spruce (Picea abies), red pine (Pinus resinosa), and white pine (Pinus strobus)] and one broadleaf, deciduous species [sugar maple (Acer saccharum)] were measured and compared at the leaf, twig, branch and canopy level.  The magnitude of reflectance throughout the visible and near infrared wavelength region was found to decrease dramatically for the conifer species as scene complexity increased from the needle, to the branch, to the canopy level.  Comparison of the conifer data with equivalent data obtained for sugar maple served to validate quantitatively that conifer canopies, in general, are more absorptive than their deciduous counterparts, particularly in the near infrared region.  These data emphasize the role of canopy constituents, such as needles, twigs, branches, bark, and understory material, in altering the reflectance characteristics of the overall "scene," and may be valuable in developing improved radiative transfer models for forest canopies.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The radiometry of the NS001 Thematic Mapper Simulator reflective channels was examined based on laboratory tests conducted between 1987 and 1989.  Principal emphasis was on absolute calibration.  The NS001 data are calibrated in-flight by reference to the NS001 internal integrating sphere source.  Apparent instabilities in this source or its monitoring circuitry, which are not fully understood, are the principal limiting factors in the absolute calibration of NS001 data.  Uncertainties due solely to this behavior may reach 25% in 1987, though more typically are expected to be less than 15%.  Other identified error sources at the 1-2% level for typical signals include dark current drift along the scan line, hysteresislike sensitivity changes along the scan line, random noise, scan-speed-induced errors, and nonlinearity.  Channel 7 (2.08-2.35-mu-m) shows a number of peculiarities that are hysteresislike including a change in the apparent dark current drift along scan with scene brightness and a drop in sensitivity in scanning across a bright target of an estimated 8% over the total 100-degrees scan angle.  Polarization sensitivity of the NS001 was such that for typical atmospheric conditions errors in Channel 1 (.45-.52-mu-m) radiances would be up to +/- 10% and vary with scan angle; this progressively decreases with increasing wavelength.

AB This work assesses the performance of a yield estimation model for sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) that uses spectral data in conjunction with yield estimated from an agrometeorological model. The test site was the Sugarcane plantations of the Lencois Paulista municipality in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Production data for four crop years were analyzed. Yields (tons of stalks/ha) of the first crop year (1983/84) were regressed against spectral and agrometeorological data of that same year and used to predict the yield the following crop year, i.e., 1984/85. The models to predict the yield is subsequent years (up to 1987/88) were developed similarly, incorporating all previous years' data. The yield estimations obtained from these models explained 69%, 54% and 50% of the yield variation in the 1984/85, 1985/86, and 1986/87 crop years, respectively. The accuracy of yield estimations based on spectral data only (vegetation index model) and agrometeorological data only (agrometeorological model) that were also investigated gave poorer results than the combined agrometeorological model) that were also investigated gave poorer results than the combined agrometeorological - spectral model.
