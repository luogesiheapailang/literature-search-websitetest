AB Leaf area index (LAI) is an important variable needed by various land surface process models. It has been produced operationally from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data using a look-up table (LUT) method, but the inversion accuracy still needs significant improvements. We propose an alternative method in this study that integrates both the radiative transfer (RT) simulation and nonparametric regression methods. Two nonparametric regression methods (i.e., the neural network [NN] and the projection pursuit regression [PPR]) were examined. An integrated database was constructed from radiative transfer simulations tuned for two broad biome categories (broadleaf and needleleaf vegetations). A new soil reflectance index (SRI) and analytically simulated leaf optical properties were used in the parameterization process. This algorithm was tested in two sites, one at Maryland, USA, a middle latitude temperate agricultural area, and the other at Canada, a boreal forest site, and LAI was accurately estimated. The derived LAI maps were also compared with those from MODIS science team and ETM+ data. The MODIS standard LAI products were found consistent with our results for broadleaf crops, needleleaf forest, and other cover types, but overestimated broadleaf forest by 2.0-3.0 due to the complex biome types.

ID SOLAR IRRADIANCE; TRANSFER MODEL
AB As the spatial resolution of satellite sensors increase, estimates of surface solar irradiance (I-SFC) from space home observations of top of the atmosphere reflected radiance (R-TOA) can actually become less accurate because of enhanced three-dimensional (3-D) radiative effects that are not generally considered in most retrieval algorithms. An elementary approach to improving retrievals is to incorporate some form of spatial averaging through the use of superpixels. Determining the best approach for averaging and the optimum size of the superpixel is the objective of this study. It is achieved by examining the bias, correlation coefficient, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the true and estimated ISFC for a set of simulated cloud scenes and their radiative fields. Because of nonlinear effects, averaging within the superpixel should only be performed after I-SFC is retrieved from R-TOA independently for each pixel For the combined set of stratocumulus and convective cloud fields that have a cloud fraction ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 used in this study, the optimal superpixel size is about 25 km. It is found that the bias is a function of solar and viewing angles and a correction is provided that improves the bias while leaving the correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error unchanged.

AB This study investigates the relationship between yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) caught in the tropical Atlantic between 15degreesS and 15degreesN and 10degreesW and 55degreesW by the northeast Brazilian longline fleet, and environmental variables obtained from remote sensors such as sea surface temperature (AVHRR/NOAA), chlorophyll-a concentration (SeaWiFS/SeaStar), sea surface height anomaly (TOPEX/Poseidon), and wind velocity (Scatterometer/ERS-1 and -2). The observed relationships between longline catch data, expressed as catch per unit effort (CPUE), and the satellite data were analysed using the statistical method of generalized additive models (GAMs). CPUE was calculated as the number of fish caught by 100 hooks in V latitude by V longitude square grid and integrated into a month of fishing activity for the period of 1995-2000. Results obtained showed evidences of non-linear relationships between catch yields and environmental data. The largest CPUE of yellowfin tuna in the region seems to be strongly associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) position and its temporal variability. In the model, this was confirmed by the highest correlation of CPUE with the meridional wind component. This result also indicates 5degreesS as the southern limit for a larger concentration of this species during the most productive fishing period between March and May. In decreasing order of importance, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration and sea surface height anomaly, albeit statistically significant, seemed to be of secondary importance in controlling this species abundance in the region.

AB Evaluation of air- or space-bome remote sensors measuring soil moisture requires strategic ground-based sampling. As part of the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02), daily surface soil moisture sampling at 90-140 locations were conducted in four fields in Walnut Creek watershed, Iowa. Various combinations of soils, vegetation, and topography characterize the fields. Depending on the field's characteristics and soil moisture content, 3-32 independent measurements were necessary to capture the field mean volumetric soil moisture with a +/-2% bias and 95% confidence interval. Validation of the retrieved soil moisture products from the aircraft microwave instruments using the average of 14 samples per field is more appropriate for dry (< 10% volumetric soil moisture) or wet (>25% volumetric soil moisture) range than for intermediate soil moisture range. Time stability analysis showed that an appropriately selected single sampling point could provide similar accuracy across a range of soil moisture conditions. Analyses based on landscape position (depression, hilltop, steep slope, and mild slope) showed that locations with mild slopes consistently exhibit time stable features. Hilltop and steep slope locations consistently underestimated mean field soil moisture. Soils parameters could not be used to identify time stable features as sampling locations with relatively high sand content consistently underestimated the field mean while those locations with relatively high clay content consistently overestimated the field mean. However, the slope position characterization of time stable features was enhanced using soils properties. The mild slope locations having the best time-stable features are those with moderate to moderately high clay content as compare to the field average (28-30% clay). (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Imaging spectrometer data were acquired over conifer stands to retrieve spatially distributed information on canopy structure and foliage water content, which may be used to assess fire risk and to manage the impact of forest fires. The study relied on a comprehensive field campaign using stratified systematic unaligned sampling ranging from full spectroradiometric characterization of the canopy to conventional measurements of biochemical and biophysical variables. Airborne imaging spectrometer data (DAIS7915 and ROSIS) were acquired parallel to the ground measurements, describing the canopy reflectance of the observed forest. Coniferous canopies are highly heterogeneous and thus the transfer of incident radiation within the canopy is dominated by its structure. We demonstrated the viability of radiative transfer representation and compared the performance of two hybrid canopy reflectance models, GeoSAIL and FLIGHT, within this heterogeneous medium. Despite the different nature and canopy representation of these models, they yielded similar results. Subsequently, the inversion of a hyperspectral GeoSAIL version demonstrated the feasibility of estimating structure and foliage water content of a coniferous canopy based on radiative transfer modeling. Estimates of the canopy variables showed reasonably accurate results and were validated through ground measurements. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID INVENTORY; ACCURACY; VOLUME
AB The non-parametric k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) multi-source estimation method is commonly employed in forest inventories that use satellite images and field data. The method presumes the selection of a few estimation parameters. An important decision is the choice of the pixel-dependent geographical area from which the nearest field plots in the spectral space for each pixel are selected, the problem being that one spectral vector may correspond to several different ground data vectors. The weighting of different spectral components is an obvious problem when defining the distance metric in the spectral space.
   The paper presents a new method. The first innovation is that the large-scale variation of forest variables is used as ancillary data that are added to the variables of the multi-source k-NN estimation. These data are assigned weights in a way similar to the spectral information of satellite images when defining the applied distance metric. The second innovation is that "optimal" weights for spectral data, as well as ancillary data, are computed by means of a genetic algorithm. Tests with practical forest inventory data show that the method performs noticeably better than other applications of k-NN estimation methods in forest inventories, and that the problem of biases in the species volume predictions can, for example, almost completely be overcome with this new approach.

AB A previously described passive remote sensing fluorimeter (see companion paper) was modified to detect changes in the reflectance of vegetation. The utility of this remote sensing technique to measure the Physiological Reflectance Index (PRI) is shown at both leaf level under laboratory conditions and at the canopy level in the field. PRI, defined as the relative changes in reflectance at 531 run with respect to those at 570 nm (PRI = R531 - R570/R531 + R570), is related to xanthophyll-related, dynamic changes of non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. The robustness of this relationship by simultaneous remote sensing of PRI and chlorophyll fluorescence is strengthened. At the leaf level, the existence of two kinetically distinct components of PRI is shown. A fast (within seconds) component that is partly attributed to DeltapH induced chloroplast shrinkage, and a slow (within minutes), main component that is related to xanthophyll deepoxidation, as demonstrated by its disappearance in the presence of DTT. Overall, PRI correlated better with non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence (NPQ) than with any other measured parameter, including the photochemical efficiency of PSIL Finally, at the canopy level and under field conditions, it is shown that PRI can be a useful tool for remote sensing of water stress in grapevines.

AB Temperate East Asia (TEA) is characterized by diverse land cover types, including forest and agricultural lands, one of the world's largest temperate grasslands, and extensive desert and barren landscapes. In this paper, we explored the potential of SPOT-4 VEGETATION (VGT) data for the classification of land cover types in TEA, An unsupervised classification was performed using multi-temporal (March-November 2000) VGT-derived spectral indices (Land Surface Water Index [LSWI] and Enhanced Vegetation Index [EVI]) to generate a land cover map of TEA (called VGT-TEA). Land cover classes from VGT-TEA were aggregated to broad, general class types, and then compared and validated with classifications derived from fine-resolution (Landsat) data. VGT-TEA produced reasonable results when compared to the Landsat products. Analysis of the seasonal dynamics of LSWI and EVI allows for the identification of distinct growth patterns between different vegetation types. We suggest that LSWI seasonal curves can be used to define the growing season for temperate deciduous vegetation, including grassland types. Seasonal curves of EVI tend to have a slightly greater dynamic range than LSWI during the peak growing season and can be useful in discriminating between vegetation types. By using these two complementary spectral indices, VGT data can be used to produce timely and detailed land cover and phenology maps with limited ancillary data needed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study compared surface emissivity and radiometric temperature retrievals derived from data collected with the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensors, onboard the NASA's Earth Observation System (EOS)-TERRA satellite. Two study sites were selected: a semi-arid area located in northern Chihuahuan desert, USA, and a Savannah landscape located in central Africa. Atmospheric corrections were performed using the MODTRAN 4 atmospheric radiative transfer code along with atmospheric profiles generated by the National Center for Environmental Predictions (NCEP). Atmospheric radiative properties were derived from MODTRAN 4 calculations according to the sensor swaths, which yielded different strategies from one sensor to the other. The MODIS estimates were then computed using a designed Temperature-Independent Spectral Indices of Emissivity (TISIE) method. The ASTER estimates were derived using the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. The MODIS and ASTER radiometric temperature retrievals were in good agreement when the atmospheric corrections were similar, with differences lower than 0.9 K. The emissivity estimates were compared for MODIS/ASTER matching bands at 8.5 and 11 mum. It was shown that the retrievals agreed well, with RMSD ranging from 0.005 to 0.015, and biases ranging from -0.01 to 0.005. At 8.5 mum, the ranges of emissivities from both sensors were very similar. At 11 mum, however, the ranges of MODIS values were broader than those of the ASTER estimates. The larger MODIS values were ascribed to the gray body problem of the TES algorithm, whereas the lower MODIS values were not consistent with field references. Finally, we assessed the combined effects of spatial variability and sensor resolution. It was shown that for the study areas we considered, these effects were not critical. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB dAn important consideration for monitoring land-cover (LC) change is the nominal temporal frequency of remote sensor data acquisitions required to adequately characterize change events. Ecosystem-specific regeneration rates are an important consideration for determining the required frequency of data collections to minimize change omission errors. Clear-cut forested areas in north central North Carolina undergo rapid colonization from pioneer (replacement) vegetation that is often difficult to differentiate spectrally from that previously present. This study compared change detection results for temporal frequencies corresponding to 3-, 7-, and 10-year time intervals for near-anniversary date Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data acquisitions corresponding to a single path/row. Change detection was performed using an identical change vector analysis (CVA) technique for all imagery dates. Although the accuracy of the 3-year analysis was acceptable (86.3%, kappa = 0.55), a significant level of change omission errors resulted (51.7%). Accuracies associated with both the 7-year (43.6%, kappa = 0.10) and 10-year (37.2%, kappa=0.05) temporal frequency analyses performed poorly, with excessive change omission errors of 84.8% and 86.3%, respectively. The average rate of LC change observed over the study area for the 13-year index period (1987-2000) was approximately 1.0% per annum. Overall results indicated that a minimum of 3-4-year temporal data acquisition frequency is required to monitor LC change events in north central North Carolina. Reductions in change omission errors could probably best be achieved by further increasing temporal data acquisition frequencies to a 1-2-year time interval. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB A good calibration of satellite sensors is necessary to derive reliable quantitative measurements of the surface parameters or to compare data obtained from different sensors. In this study, the snow surface of the high plateau of the East Antarctic ice sheet, particularly the Dome C area (75degreesS, 123degreesE), is used first to test the quality of this site as a ground calibration target and then to determine the inter-annual drift in the sensitivity of the VEGETATION sensor, onboard the SPOT4 satellite. Dome C area has many good calibration site characteristics: The site is very flat and extremely homogeneous (only snow), there is little wind and a very small snow accumulation rate and therefore a small temporal variability, the elevation is 3200 m and the atmosphere is very clear most of the time. Finally, due to its location, it is frequently within view of many satellites. VEGETATION visible blue channel data (0.43 - 0.47 mum) of a 716 X 716 km(2) area centred on the French-Italian Dome Concordia station, during the 1998-1999, 1999-2000, 2001-2001, and 2001-2002 austral summers were cloud masked and atmospherically corrected. The snow surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function is very high with little spatial and seasonal variability, which is a major advantage for sensor calibration. The inter-annual variation is found to be very small, proving that the stability of the site is very good. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The MEditerranean Balloon EXperiment (MEBEX), conducted in August 99 from the middle-up stratosphere, was designed to assess the wind retrieval sensitivity of Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflections (GNSSR) technology from high altitudes. Global Positioning System reflected signals (GPSR) collected at altitudes around 37 km with a dedicated receiver have been inverted to mean square slopes (MSS) of the sea surface and wind speeds. The theoretical tool to interpret the geophysical parameters was a bistatic model, which also depends on geometrical parameters. The results have been analyzed in terms of internal consistency, repeatability and geometry-dependent performance. In addition, wind velocities have been compared to independent measurements by QuikSCAT, TOPEX, ERS/RA and a Radio Sonde, with an agreement better than 2 m/s. A Numerical Weather Prediction Model (NWPM, the MM5 mesoscale forecast model) has also been used for comparison with varying results during the experiment. The conclusion of-this study confirms the capability of high altitude GPSR/Delay-map receivers with low gain antennas to infer surface winds. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remotely sensed hyperspectral and digital elevation data from southeastern Idaho are combined in a new method to assess mine waste contamination. Waste rock from phosphorite mining in the area contains selenium, cadmium, vanadium, and other metals. Toxic concentrations of selenium have been found in plants and soils near some mine waste dumps. Eighteen mine waste dumps and five vegetation cover types in the southeast Idaho phosphate district were mapped by using Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery and field data. The interaction of surface water runoff with mine waste was assessed by registering the AVIRIS results to digital elevation data, enabling determinations of (1) mine dump morphologies, (2) catchment watershed areas above each mine dump, (3) flow directions from the dumps, (4) stream gradients, and (5) the extent of downstream wetlands available for selenium absorption.
   Watersheds with the most severe selenium contamination, such as the South Maybe Canyon watershed, are associated with mine dumps that have large catchment watershed areas, high stream gradients, a paucity of downstream wetlands, and dump forms that tend to obstruct stream flow. Watersheds associated with low concentrations of dissolved selenium, such as Angus Creek, have mine dumps with small catchment watershed areas, low stream gradients, abundant wetlands vegetation, and less obstructing dump morphologies.

AB The problem of how the scale, or spatial resolution, of reflectance data impacts retrievals of vegetation leaf area index (LAI) is addressed in this article. We define the goal of scaling as the process by which it is established that LAI values derived from coarse resolution sensor data equal the arithmetic average of values derived independently from fine resolution sensor data. The increasing probability of land cover mixtures with decreasing resolution is defined as heterogeneity, which is a key concept in scaling studies. The effect of pixel heterogeneity on spectral reflectances and LAI retrievals is investigated with 1-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data aggregated to different coarse spatial resolutions. It is shown that LAI retrieval errors at coarse resolution are inversely related to the proportion of the dominant land cover in such pixel. Further, large errors in LAI retrievals are incurred when forests are minority biomes in non-forest pixels compared to when forest biomes are mixed with one another, and vice versa. A physically based scaling with explicit spatial resolution-dependent radiative transfer formulation is developed. The successful application of this theory to scaling LAI retrievals from AVHRR data of different resolutions is demonstrated. These principles underlie our approach to the production and validation of LAI product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) aboard the TERRA platform.

AB The MODIS Land team is producing a suite of global land products whose uncertainty will be estimated through validation activities. The MODIS Land team will base its validation work on the comparison of its products to similar products derived from independent sources. The independent products will be derived from a combination of in situ data and imagery from airborne and spaceborne sensors. Since in situ and image data can often serve to validate more than one product and sensor, the MODIS Land Discipline Team's validation strategy has focused on data collection and analysis at the EOS Land Validation Core Sites. Initial characterization of these sites is presented, as well as an overview of the on-line access to imagery and field data collected over these sites. The data and resources available through this work are available to the science community for continued validation and scientific investigations. This paper describes the results of a 4-year effort to develop the infrastructure to allow timely and comprehensive validation of EOS land products. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The Mediterranean Basin, subject both to climate changes and to increasing anthropogenic inputs, is an appropriate test site for observing the evolution of algal biomass and primary production on a long-term basis. With this aim, it is first necessary to study the consistency of the various sets of satellite data as provided by the space agencies, and to compare them to in situ available data. Pixel-by-pixel comparisons of the Level 3 chlorophyll products derived from the ocean color and temperature scanner (OCTS; Version 4, August 1999), polarization and directionality of earth reflectances (POLDER; reprocessing no. 2, July 2000), and the sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS; reprocessing no. 3, May 2000) reveal a reasonably good agreement. Discrepancies, however, appear particularly in oligotrophic areas: weekly (or 10-day) means for OCTS and POLDER (which were operating simultaneously) differ in these areas by 30-70% on average, and OCTS and SeaWiFS weekly means, at 1-year distance, reveal differences by up to a factor of 2. Comparisons with measurements at sea, performed during various cruises, show that all these sensors tend to overestimate chlorophyll concentrations in oligotrophic waters. A "regional algorithm" is proposed to reduce this bias. The impact of using the various datasets for chlorophyll concentration, and for seawater temperature (Reynolds sea surface temperature [SST] analyses, Levitus climatological profiles) for primary production computations is shown. Because they are simultaneous to ocean color data, Reynolds analyses appear to be the most appropriate inputs to such computations. They have, however, to be combined with climatological vertical profiles of seawater temperature, so as to provide representative values for the productive layer. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Improved processing algorithms are being developed, under the AVHRR Land Pathfinder II (ALP-II) Project, to process the entire Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) archive, including methods to produce surface temperature (T-S) measurements from the thermal infrared portion of the observation record. This new data set should assist in the monitoring of global terrestrial environmental conditions on seasonal to interannual time scales. The impact of both the calibration and filter function variations between National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-AVHRR sensors is addressed in this proposed ALP-II approach. Accounting for these sensor factors reduces the error of intersatellite comparison of surface temperatures by as much as 2.3 K. The environmental factors were also addressed, including the surface emissivity, large range of atmospheric water vapor (WV) across the globe, and the potential for large surface-to-air temperature differences for land. To account for both the sensor and environmental factors in the ALP-H data set, we derive, from the MODTRAN-3 model, two sets of new coefficients, for low and high WV in the atmosphere. Two types of split-window equations were analyzed, the linear and quadratic forms of the land split-window equations. Our MODTRAN-based analysis suggests that the quadratic form is more accurate than the linear form, especially for high WV contents. These coefficients can be used in our LST algorithm in combination with a global emissivity map and WV data from Global Circulation Model (GCM). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SURFACE; TEMPERATURE
AB Land surface temperature (LST) is an important component of the energy-budget of the surface. In order to determine the brightness temperature (BT) measured by a satellite for a given LST, the atmospheric influence on radiance emitted by the surface has to be accounted for. Provided that the current state of the atmosphere (vertical moisture and temperature profiles) and the surface emissivity are sufficiently well known, it is possible to calculate the BT using a radiative transfer model (RTM), e.g., Moderate Resolution Transmittance Code 3 (MODTRAN-3). RTMs do not linearise the atmospheric effect and variations of surface emissivity, elevation, and view angle (i.e., the path through the atmosphere) are readily accounted for. However, RTMs are very expensive in terms of computing time and, therefore, not well suited to simulate large quantities of data. In order to overcome this limitation, the main objective of this study is to investigate if MODTRAN-3 can be substituted by a feed-forward neural network (NN). Training and validation data consist of inputs and outputs of MODTRAN-3 for 84 TOVS Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) profiles in the middle latitudes (45degreesN to 55degreesN). The RTM was run for these atmospheric situations and a range of LSTs, surface elevations, and view angles. In total, 4032 radiative transfer calculations were performed. A NN developed manually for this data is evaluated using forward calculations for atmospheric profiles from the European Centre of Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses. Grid cells of the ECMWF analyses containing clouds are identified using cloudmasks derived from Meteosat IR and VIS data. The manually developed NN is compared against a NN developed by the evolutionary algorithm "Evolutionarer Netzwerk Optimierer" (ENZO). ENZO evolves populations of NNs: it utilises mutation and crossover to optimise NN topology (layers, number of neurons, and weights) and trains (fine-tunes) the NNs with the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS). The NN developed by ENZO has a rms validation error (untrained TIGR situations) of 0.25 K and a rms verification error (cloud-free situations from ECMWF analyses) of 0.31 K. ENZO is shown to produce substantially smaller NNs than the manual approach: the developed NN has 58% fewer hidden neurons and about 90% fewer weights than the manually developed NN. Furthermore, the NN developed by ENZO is more robust and generalises better. A major advantage of the NN is its computational speed, which is estimated to be of the order of 104 times faster than MODTRAN-3. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A two-layer model of the bidirectional reflectance of homogeneous vegetation canopies is derived in this paper. The anisotropic scattering of both the vegetation canopy and the background, i.e., bare soil or leaf litter, is taken into consideration in this model. The effect of the anisotropic scattering from the background to the apparent canopy reflectance in different leaf area indices of three leaf-orientation canopies is presented. The model is validated against simulated and field-measurement data. The inversion process is used to retrieve the optical properties of leaf and background. The model is used to predict the bidirectional reflectances from the parameters retrieved by the inversion process. The predicted bidirectional reflectances agree well with those assumed by the simulated data. The leaf optical properties retrieved by the model inversion are discussed and validated against values known from the measurements. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Quantification of forest structure is important for developing a better understanding of how forest ecosystems function. Additionally, estimation of forest structural attributes, such as aboveground biomass (AGBM), is an important step in identifying the amount of carbon in terrestrial vegetation pools and is central to global carbon cycle studies. Although current remote sensing techniques recover such tropical forest structure poorly, new large-footprint lidar instruments show great promise. As part of a prelaunch validation plan for the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) mission, the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS), a large-footprint airborne scanning lidar, was flown over the La Selva Biological Station, a tropical wet forest site in Costa Rica. The primary objective of this study was to test the ability of large-footprint lidar instruments to recover forest structural characteristics across a spectrum of land cover types from pasture to secondary and primary tropical forests. LVIS metrics were able to predict field-derived quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD), basal area, and AGBM with R 2 values of up to .93,.72, and .93, respectively. These relationships were significant and nonasymptotic through the entire range of conditions sampled at the La Selva. Our results confirm the ability of large-footprint lidar instruments. to estimate. important structural attributes, including biomass in dense tropical forests, and when taken along with similar results from studies in temperate forests, strongly validate the VCL mission framework.

AB The derivation of vegetation leaf area index (LAI) and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) absorbed by vegetation globally from the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) multispectral surface reflectances using the algorithm developed for the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument is discussed here, with special emphasis on the quality of the retrieved fields. Uncertainties in the land surface reflectance and model used in the algorithm determine the quality of the retrieved LAI/FPAR fields. The in-orbit radiances measured by space-borne sensors require corrections for calibration and atmospheric effects, and this introduces uncertainty in the surface reflectance products. The model uncertainty characterizes the accuracy of a vegetation radiation interaction model to approximate the observed variability in surface reflectances. When the amount of spectral information input to the retrieval technique is increased, not only does this increase the overall information content but also decreases the summary accuracy in the data. The former enhances quality of the retrievals, while the latter suppresses it. The quality of the retrievals can be influenced by the use of uncertainty information in the retrieval technique. We introduce a stabilized uncertainty, which is basic information to the retrieval technique required to establish its convergence; that is, the more the measured information and the more accurate this information is, the more reliable and accurate the algorithm output will be. The quality of retrieval is a function of the stabilized uncertainty whose accurate specification is critical for deriving biophysical surface parameters of the highest quality possible using multispectral land surface data. The global LAI and FPAR maps derived from SeaWiFS multispectral surface reflectances and uncertainty information, as well as an analysis of these products is presented here.

AB The spatial and temporal distribution of land cover is a fundamental dataset for urban ecological research. An expert (or hypothesis testing) system has been used with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to derive a land cover classification for the semiarid Phoenix metropolitan portion of the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long Term Ecological Research (CAP LTER) site. Expert systems allow for the integration of remotely sensed data with other sources of georeferenced information such as land use data, spatial texture, and digital elevation models (DEMs) to obtain greater classification accuracy. Logical decision rules are used with the various datasets to assign class values to each pixel. TM reflectance data acquired in 1998 [visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) bands plus a vegetation index] were initially classified for land cover using a maximum likelihood decision rule. In addition, spatial texture of the TM data was calculated. An expert system was constructed to perform postclassification sorting of the initial land cover classification using additional spatial datasets such as texture, land use, water rights, city boundaries, and Native American reservation boundaries. Pixels were reclassified using logical decision rules into 12 classes. The overall accuracy of this technique was 85%. Individual class user's accuracy ranged from 73% to 99%, with the exception of the commercial/industrial materials class. This class performed poorly (user's accuracy of 49%) due to the similarity of subpixel components with other classes. The results presented here indicate that the expert system approach will be useful both for ongoing CAP LTER research, as well as the planned global Urban Environmental Monitoring (UEM) program of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) instrument.

AB Analysis and interpretation of high-altitude. optical observations of the marine environment requires compensation for atmospheric effects. However, some of these effects, such as water vapor absorption, are difficult to compute doe to the significant atmospheric scattering relative to surface reflection and upwelling radiance. We separate atmospheric path-scattered radiation from surface reflectance using ocean wave-induced spatial modulations in the at-sensor radiance image. A new spectrum ls constructed from the amplitude of the spatial modulations found in each wavelength band. Water vapor absorption is computed using the modulated spectra employing standard techniques applicable to bright targets (such as are incorporated in the atmospheric removal code ATREM). The algorithm can be extended to retrieve water vapor per pixel by removing art effective atmospheric reflectivity from the radiance field. This effective reflectivity is computed from differences in absorption features between the modulated and original spectra. These technique are demonstrated using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer hyperspectral data acquired over the Santa Barbara Channel. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Two aerosol optical depth retrieval algorithms, using different instruments and different methods, are compared. The first method uses both the directional and the spectral information of the Along Track Scanning Radiometer 2 (ATSR-2) to compute the aerosol optical depth in the visible and near-infrared ranges. The second algorithm uses data in the wavelength range between 0.340 mum and 0.400 mum from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) to determine the aerosol optical depth in the ultraviolet. Both ATSR-2 and GOME are onboard the ERS-2 satellite. The two methods are applied to data from the ERS-2 overpass over northwestern Europe on 25 July 1995. The retrieved aerosol optical depths compare favorably. Also, there is good comparison between satellite retrievals and ground-based measurements. Optical depth images show a large aerosol plume over Belgium and northern France. Back-trajectories indicate that the sources for this aerosol plume are the industrialized regions in Germany and Belgium. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB As a preliminary study on the use of Ocean Color Temperature Scanner (OCTS) chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) maps for fishery and oceanographic studies, version 3.0 OCTS Chl-a products were validated with sea surface Chl-a data and compared with the oceanic structure, current field, and fishing grounds in temperate coastal Pacific waters east of Japan during April to June 1997. Underestimation of OCTS values for high Chl-a concentrations and ghost patterns in coastal areas suggest that the OCTS ocean color algorithm needs to be improved. OCTS images depicted detailed Chl-a distributions associated with the oceanic fields observed by hydrographic data. The Chl-a-rich coastal waters correlated closely with the cold waters, suggesting that coastal upwelling might enhance nutrient supply and phytoplankton production. The high Chl-a frontal eddies near the meander crest of the Kuroshio Extension (KE) may be caused by a combination of advection of coastal waters by the KE front and an upwelling due to the cyclonic circulation. Fishing grounds reported during this period were often distributed in and around the high Chl-a area of the frontal eddy and around another coastal eddy. These results suggest that high Chl-a waters can be one of the important factors enhancing fishing ground formation. OCTS Chl-a images are useful to clarify the detailed biological processes in the Kuroshio frontal region of the Joban/Kashima coast of Japan. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Validation, mapping, and modeling efforts, require accurate methods to transform process rates and ecosystem attributes estimated from small field plots to the 250-1000-m-wide cells used by a new; generation of land cover mapping sensors. We provide alternative scale transformations, each with attendant assumptions and limitations. The choice of method depends on spatial characteristics oft he land cover variables in question and consequently may vary between biomes or with the intended application. Wc extend the fractal similarity dimension renormalization method, previously det-eloped for binary maps, to continuous variables. The method can preserve both the mean and the multifractal properties of the image, thereby satisfying a major goal, namely, to privide accurate areal estimates without sacrificing information about within-site variation. The scale transformation enables the multifractal scaling exponents of landscapes or individual spectral bands to be brought in and out of register with each other, thereby opening another dimension upon which to detect the scales at which various land use or terrain processes operate. Alternatively, landscapes can be selectively rescaled to highlight patterns due to particular processes. We recommend geostatistical procedures with which to assess spatial characteristics both within a site and within individual image cells. We recommend that aggregation of fine-grain measurements during validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) products be based on continuous variables to reduce errors that originate uncertainties in binary maps.

TI Airborne digital camera image semivariance for evaluation of forest

ID VIDEOGRAPHY; VARIOGRAMS
AB A forest downstream of a heavy metal acid tailings area at the KamKotia mine site near Timmins, Ontario shows visible signs of damage which include varied leaf size, leaf discoloration, dead branches, and increased individual tree crown and forest canopy openness. High resolution remote sensing has potential for providing means to spatially and temporally evaluate such damage. In particular, image texture can be sued in modeling forest and individual tree structural variations which may result from stress. In this study, an airborne multispectral digital camera system was used to acquire imagery with ground pixel spacing of 0.25 m, 0.5 m, and 1.0 m. Relations of image semivariance measures with field forest structure and health measures were determined. Semivariograms were derived using two sampling techniques: transects in two perpindicular directions, and omnidirectional sampling within pixel matrices. Sampling was conducted over the forest canopy as well as within individual tree crowns. The principal objective of the study was to determine the types of forest canopy and individual tree crown structure and health information captured by semivariograms at the three spatial resolutions. In canopy scale sampling, the 1 m pixel semivariograms were best related to forest canopy closure, stem density, and a visually derived tree stress index. The 0.5 m pixel semivariograms related better to tree crown size and tree height. The transect technique was more sensitive to tree height ant the matrix technique produced stronger relations with tree stress. In individual tree crown samples, the 0.25 m pixel semivariograms were well related to tree crown closure. This suggests that semivariograms extracted from the 1 m and 0.5 m pixel images are suitable for mapping structural and textural information related to forest damage at the canopy level while the semivariograms extracted from the 0.25 m pixel images depict information at the tree crown level.

TI Assessment of snow-cover mapping accuracy in a variety of

ID SURFACE ALBEDO
AB Field and aircraft measurements are acquired in April 1995 in central Alaska to map snow; cover with MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) data, acquired from high-altitude aircraft. The Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a 36-channel system that will be launched on the EOS-AM-1 platform in 1999. A vegetation-density map derived from integrated reflectances (R(i)), from MAS data, is compared with an independently-produced vegetation type and density map derived from Thematic Mapper (TM) and ancillary data. The maps agreed to within 13%, thus corroborating the effectiveness of using the reflectance technique for mapping vegetation density. Snow cover was mapped on a 13 April 1995 MAS image, using the original MODIS prototype algorithm and an enhanced MODIS prototype algorithm. Field measurements revealed that the area was completely snow covered. With the original algorithm, snow teas mapped in 96% of the pixels having <50% vegetation-cover density according to the R(i) map, while in the areas having vegetation-cover densities greater than or equal to 50%, snow was mapped in only 71% of the pixels. When the enhanced MODIS snow-mapping algorithm was employed, 99% of the pixels having <50% vegetation-cover density were mapped, and 98% of the pixels with greater than or equal to 50% vegetation-cover density were mapped as snow covered. These results demonstrate that. the enhanced algorithm represents a significant improvement over the original MODIS prototype algorithm especially in the mapping of snow; In dense vegetation. The enhanced algorithm will thus be adopted as the MODIS at-launch snow-cover algorithm. Using this simple method for estimating vegetation density from pixel reflectance, it rc;ill be possible to analyze the accuracy of the MODIS snow-cover algorithm in a range of vegetation-cover in places where information on vegetation-cover density is not available from ground measurements.

AB This study evaluates the use of polarimetric Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) data to assess woody shrub density in a semiarid site where the vegetation consists primarily of varied mixtures of herbaceous vegetation and shrubs. AIRSAR data and field observations of vegetation cover and growth form-composition were obtained for 59 sites in the Jornada del Muerto plain in southern New Mexico. Radar signature measures examined were C-, L- and VV polarizations, ratios of sigma(0)HH and sigma(0)HV to sigma(0)VV, and the HH-VV polarization phase difference and correlation coefficient. The most effective measure for estimation of shrub density was L-band sigma 0HV, which distinguished among shrub density classes with no misclassification. Sensitivity of this measure to small amounts of shrub cover was indicated by successful separation of sites with <1% shrub cover from sites with 1-5% cover. Separability of shrub density classes was generally least for C-band signature measures. A distinctive radar signature was exhibited by dense stands of Yucca elata, a semitreelike plant with uniformly thick (approximate to 10 cm diameter) fibrous stems. Yucca sites were distinguished from others by their high P-band sigma 0HV relative to L-band sigma 0HV. The results are largely explained by the greater sensitivity of longer wavelengths to larger canopy structural elements. L-band sigma 0HV and other measures responsive to canopy volume scattering were more strongly related to shrub than to herbaceous plant cover because woody shrub canopies have numberous stems of the intermediate size to which L-band is most sensitive, whereas stems of this size are mostly lacking in herbaceous canopies. The uniform-diameter stems of yucca have larger dimensions to which P-band is more sensitive than L-band. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998

It is uncle-stood that coral blenching results from an expulsion or reduction of the algae housed in the individual polyp, which causes the cor-nl to lose its color. Satellite or airborne remote sensing may be a feasible means of mapping and monitoring cor-al reefs over large geographic areas if a quantitative ?means of remotely determining coral health can be developed. In an effort to remotely detect co ml stress, in.situ spectral rflectance of healthy and bleached Fijian scleractinian combs was measured with a handheld spectroradiometer. Principal components and cluster analysis revealed that there is a spectral distinction between healthy and bleached cor-al based largely on magnitude of reflectance. Spectral derivative analysis was used to determine the specific wavelength regions ideal for remote identification of substrate type. These results are encouraging with respect to using an airborne spectroradiometer to identify areas of bleached corals thus enabling accurate monitoring. over time. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB A derailed quality and sensitivity analysis of hyperspectral BRDF data, acquired under controlled laboratory conditions at the European Goniometric Facility (EGO) of the Joint Research Center, Ispra/Italy, has been performed. In regard to bidirectional reflectance measurements in the field with the FIGOS goniometer, the impact of angular data sampling, the movement of the Sun, and the Lambertian assumption of a Spectralon panel have been analyzed. An erectophile grass lawn canopy and a planophile watercress surface were chosen as main targets. A GER-3700 spectroradiometer providing hyperspectral resolution allowed for analyzing the wavelength dependency of the effects. The results of the sensitivity analysis show; that in a first step a moderate resolution of 15 degrees and 30 degrees in zenith and azimuth, respectively, Is adequate to capture the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of vegetated targets. Only in the hot spot area a higher resolution is desirable. The movement of the light source during data acquisition is found to be critical, and should be kept within +/-1 degrees source zenith angle in order to obtain homologous BRDF data sets. Due to the wavelength dependence of BRDF effects, the impact of the light source may vary significantly between different wavelength ranges. A normalization of the irradiance with the help of frequent reference measurements is recommended, and should be carried out using a panel with known BRDF characteristics. The Spectralon panel examined showed deviations from a Lambertian panel of up to 5% and more, bur obeyed Helmholtz's reciprocity law. Corresponding calibration coefficients are given for correcting the non-Lambertian behavior in field applications. Laboratory specific constraints such as the nonparallelism and heterogeneity of the lamp are assessed and corrected where necessary and feasible. The reproducibility of the BRDF data obtained lies within 1-9% rmse, depending on target type, wavelength range, and measurement duration. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID SEMIARID RANGELANDS; FIFE; ENERGY; VEGETATION
AB Using remotely sensed surface temperature to estimate the sensible heat flux over partial canopy covered surfaces, one faces the problem of how the bare soil and plant foliage temperatures contributing to the radiometric surface temperature are related to the turbulent transport of sensible heat across the surface-atmosphere interface. To solve this problem, several sensible hear models, using radiometric surface temperature, have appeared in the literature. In this study, using the observational data from three interdisciplinary field experiments [the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE), Monsoon '90 and Washita '92], the performance of four models using average values of their parameters in predicting land surface sensible heat flux was evaluated. By analyzing the sensitivity of the models to common parameters and input variables, reasons for differences in the performances of the models and the potential to improve the agreement with observations have been ascertained. From the comparisons of modeled versus measured sensible heat flux for the different surfaces, the dual-source model in Norman et al. (1995) had the best agreement with its mean absolute percent difference (MAPD) values being similar to the observational accuracy (i.e., similar to 20%). Front the sensitivity analysis the model appears to have the greatest potential for operational applications since it requires relatively few parameters and Is not very sensitive to the uncertainty in most of the model parameters. The single-source models in Kustas et al. (1989) and Troufleau et al. (1996) require accurate estimates of the surface roughness z(0m) and empirical relationships to account for differences between aerodynamic and radiometric temperature. Therefore, it may be difficult to improve their performance without some independent means of estimating the empirical coefficients and a reliable method for determining z(0m). Estimates from the dual-source model in Lhomme et al. (1994) tend to produce the largest scatter with the observations. This may be related to the fact that the model is more sensitive to variations in most of the parameters common in dual-source models. In addition, its response to high surface-air temperature differences in the sensitivity analysis differs from all other models. Therefore, it may be more difficult to obtain reliable estimates from this model on an operational basis. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996.

AB Two different mechanisms, shadow-hiding and coherent backscatter, can cause a hot spot, or opposition effect, in the bidirectional reflectance of vegetation and soils. Because the two mechanisms sample different properties, it is important to know which one is primarily responsible in a given medium. This question can be answered by measuring the bidirectional reflectance in circularly polarized light. If the results of the limited experiments reported here can be extrapolated to a wider range of materials, it appears that the primary cause of the hot spot in most vegetation canopies and in moist, clumpy soils is shadow-hiding. However, in vegetation with large numbers of wavelength-sized structures, such as mosses, and in dry, fine-grained soils, the hot spot is dominated by coherent backscatter.

TI Preflight calibration anomaly in the NOAA 14 AVHRR channels 1 and 2
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SCATTERING
AB Preflight calibration data for the visible and near-infrared channels of the NOAA 15 AVHRR suggests a kink in the response function at a reflectance of similar to 6% in Channel 1 and similar to 12% in Channel 2. Analysis of the ratio of the instrument's response in the two channels shows that this is an artifact of the preflight calibration performed in 1993, and not a genuine response anomaly. This effect may be explained by the entry of stray light from the integrating sphere into the instrument during the period when the space clamp target is viewed. The preflight operational calibration equations were based on this flawed data set. Fortunately, there is sufficient information to permit a recalibration. The revision leads to a reduction in reflectance for a given digital count value, by comparison with the published preflight calibration. The revision had significant consequences for low radiance applications such as the NOAA/NESDIS aerosol optical depth product, which showed anomalously high values during the first months of operation of NOAA 14.

AB Understanding the consistencies and changes in settlement detection ability related to radar system and environmental parameters is of potential interest to applications-oriented users as well as to those interested in improving our understanding of basic system-target interactions. Previous efforts in radar settlement detection have contributed to an eclectic collection of data, but few studies have been able to employ multiple images of the same area. In this experiment, L-band, like-polarized SIR-B radar imagery of southern Germany and northeastern France are examined. Three data takes at three different incident angles and two different look directions covering some 20,000 square kilometers comprised the study area. Two analyses were performed: one of the entire imaged areas, and one limited to similar terrain conditions to focus on look direction effects. Errors of omission and commission were calculated and accuracies tabulated for both tests. Results indicated that steep incident angles were of minimal utility, generating the highest omission and commission errors. Accuracy improved as incident angle increased, up to a point, and then decreased. The results obtained over mixed terrain were not in accord with those obtained over similar terrain.

LA English

ID CONTERMINOUS UNITED-STATES
AB A comparison was made between 3 years of NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and an Environmental Protection Agency derived ecoregion map of Utah. NOAA-AVHRR NDVI data representing 61 B-week periods were extracted from the USGS ''Conterminous U.S. AVHRR Biweekly Composites'' CDs for 1990-1992. An ecoregion map of Utah was extracted from the 1:7,500,00 ''Ecoregions of the United States'' database compiled by Omernik (1987). Mean and variance statistics for each 2-week period were compared between ecoregions. With the exception. of two Omernik ecoregions, the Colorado Plateau and Northern Basin and Range, yearly mean NDVI values were significantly different. The Colorado Plateau and Northern Basin. and Range were significantly different during the latter part of summer and early fall. NDVI variation was found to be a function of interacting climatic, topographic, and latitudinal zonation that influence vegetation growth. These factors also influence ecoregion boundary delineation.; Results suggest that ecoregions may be characterized based on phenological variation of vegetation components using NDVI distribution maps as surrogates for vegetation production.

AB This article proposes a simple new logic for classifying global vegetation. The critical features of this classification are that 1) it is based on simple, observable, unambiguous characteristics of vegetation structure that are important to ecosystem biogeochemistry and can be measured in the field for validation, 2) the structural characteristics are remotely sensible so that repeatable and efficient global reclassifications of existing vegetation will be possible, and 3) the defined vegetation classes directly translate into the biophysical parameters of interest by global climate and biogeochemical models. A first test of this logic for the continental United States is presented based on an existing 1 km AVHRR normalized difference vegetation index database. Procedures for solving critical remote sensing problems needed to implement the classification are discussed. Also, some inferences from this classification to advanced vegetation biophysical variables such as specific leaf area and photosynthetic capacity useful to global biogeochemical modeling are suggested.

DT Article
ID ATMOSPHERIC CARBON-DIOXIDE; SCATTERING; AEROSOLS; MODEL; SPACE
AB Two radiative transfer models are applied to the characterization of radiative transfer properties of Sahara dust aerosols in the western Sahara. One model, the Dave vector program, allows computation of she photometry and polarization of dust storms as well as the characterization of the solar flux divergence in the spectral range from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. The other model, LOWTRAN 5, computes the radiance and transmission of the atmosphere, including aerosols, from the near infrared to the far infrared. As a result of the modeling at wavelengths of 0.33 mu m, 0.400 mu m, 0.500 mu m and 1.0 mu m and comparison to measurements at 0.33 mu m and 1.0 mu m, the models are valid for the application. The desert dust aerosols have a very small effect on the infrared atmospheric transmission, but water vapor has a significant effect. It also appears that aerosol content, composition, and distribution may be inferred by remote sensing. It is also evident that polarization can be a valuable adjunct to photometry in the remote sensing of Sahara dust aerosol.

AB Results from helicopter measurements of the angular properties of surface reflectance for the alkali flats regions of the White Sands Missile Range are presented for the wavelength interval of 0.4 to 0.85 mu m. This work was performed to allow accurate radiative transfer calculations over the region. Detailed tables and interpolation equations are given that permit other investigators to perform satellite calibrations over the alkali flats site. The effects of wavelength and soil moisture on narrowband angular reflectance are also investigated. Although there is a spectral variation in surface albedo, there is little spectral effect in Anisotropic Factor except in the forward-scattering peak at solar zenith angles greater than 60 degrees. The magnitude of the forward-scattering peak is also sensitive to soil moisture, with wet conditions causing a larger peak. The significance of this result is that angular reflectance properties at the center of the alkali flats usually will be different than those at the flats edge because moisture differences typically exist.

ID THERMAL IR DATA; NOAA AVHRR; VEGETATION
AB Remotely sensed surface temperatures have proven useful for monitoring evapotranspiration (ET) rates and crop water use because of their direct relationship with sensible and latent energy exchange processes. Procedures for using the thermal infrared (IR) obtained with hand-held radiometers deployed at ground level are now well established and even routine for many agricultural research and management purposes. The availability of IR from meteorological satellites at scales from 1 km (NOAA-AVHRR) to 5 km (METEOSAT) permits extension of local, ground-based approaches to larger scale crop monitoring programs. Regional observations of surface minus air temperature (i.e., the stress degree day) and remote estimates of daily ET were derived from satellite data over sites in France, the Sahel, and North Africa and summarized here. Results confirm that similar approaches can be applied at local and regional scales despite differences in pixel size and heterogeneity. This article analyzes methods for obtaining these data and outlines the potential utility of satellite data for operational use at the regional scale.

AB A new statistical description of the ocean surface is proposed and described. Classically it is assumed that the spectrum of the surface vertical displacements depends only on one external, or forcing parameter-the wind speed (or the wind friction velocity); this is, true for fully developed sea states only. In the more general case of nonfully developed sea states, the spectrum should depend as well on internal parameters describing the characteristic features of the surface. Such a representation is discussed in this article for applications to active and passive microwave remote sensing of the oceans.

AB In forestry applications, the classical and the inverse calibration methods are commonly used to correct for misclassification bias in satellite-based areal cover type estimates. Both methods, as applied in forestry, require that the reference data used for calibration be independent of the data used to train the classifier. Further, variance estimates for the calibration methods are valid only if the reference data arise from a simple random sample. A comprehensive simulation study was conducted comparing these two methods for a broad range of cover type distributions, classification accuracies, and reference sample sizes. The estimates of the two methods were compared on the basis of bias and accuracy. Variance estimates for the two methods were also studied. The inverse method consistently outperformed the classical method. Results of the simulation study and possible implications are discussed.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID REMOTE MEASUREMENTS; COLOR
AB In a companion article, an analytical model for the cloud-free atmosphere/ocean system directional reflectance is developed. In this article, the model is inverted against airborne POLDER directional and spectral measurements acquired during its first oceanic campaign. After an interband calibration of the measurements on the sun glitter reflectance, the model fits the observations with a 1.2% relative accuracy. The aerosol optical thickness and the Angstrom coefficient retrieved by the inversion procedure agree very well with surface measurements. The spectral ocean reflectance accuracy is not sufficient, however, to retrieve the chlorophyll pigment concentration. The directional specular reflectance is used to derive the wave slope distribution, which leads to the wind speed and direction. These parameters agree very well with surface observations. If this finding is confirmed during forthcoming campaigns, spaceborne POLDER measurements could then be used for a global oceanic retrieval of wind speed and direction. The analytical model accurately reproduces all spectral and angular reflectance variations observed with POLDER. These include a large reflectance asymmetry with respect to the principal plane associated with the anisotropic wave slope distribution.

AB In order to retrieve accurate values of land surface temperatures from satellite thermal infrared data, it is necessary to perform atmospheric corrections. This paper describes how a differential absorption method, similar to the split window technique used over sea surfaces, can be adapted and used locally over land surfaces. Work previously performed by several authors is first described, allowing one to stress the different issues to be solved, that is, the emissivity and angular effects. A semiempirical algorithm is then described, and the results obtained with it over two test areas are then described and discussed. The proposed method allows to derive land surface temperature with an accuracy better than 1.5 K. A possible algorithm is also suggested.

AB The objective of this study in 1986-1987 was to determine whether it was possible to remotely identify the specific habitat or habitats of the African bont tick, Amblyomma variegatum, using Landsat-TM imagery data. An unsupervised classification of the April 1986 image was carried out using LAS KMEANS and SPCSRT. The predictability of the landcover classes was determined by visiting random preselected sites within wetlands, woodlands, canefields, and grazing. On a second visit adult ticks were counted in over 103 herds and the habitats recorded. Descriminant analysis indicated that there were a limited number of tick habitats. The tick counts for the herds within these habitats indicate that each habitat probably has a characteristic tick density. The visible farms in Grande Terre, representing four habitats, were then compared with the landcover classes found in a 5 x 5 pixel array at each farm site in the classified image. The habitats could be separated using principal component analysis. Divisive clustering analysis was applied to the band values and derived indices for a similar sized array for each farm site visible in the original unclassified image of Guadeloupe. This analysis clustered the sites by large and small variance of band values, and by vegetation and moisture indices. Herds in heterogeneous sites with large variances had more ticks than those in homogeneous or low variance sites. Within the heterogeneous sites, those with high vegetation and moisture indices had more ticks than those with low values.

TI ESTIMATION OF COMPLEX REFRACTIVE-INDEX OF SOIL PARTICLES AND ITS
   DEPENDENCE ON SOIL CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID REFLECTANCE; SURFACES; ALBEDO; MODEL
AB It has been commonly observed that soil moisture conditions, in addition to soil chemical components such as organic matters and free iron oxides, complicate the interpretation of soil reflection. Based on the idea that darkening of soils on wetting is attributed to an increase in the average degree of forward scattering, which is caused by changing the medium surrounding soil particles from air to water, a theoretical model was formulated to estimate the effect of soil moisture on soil reflection. This was done by using the delta-Eddington approximation for multiple scattering, together with Mie theory for single scattering. The model contains only one adjustable parameter, a complex refractive index of soil particles. The complex refractive index of soil particles was identified from the observed spectral albedos on both dry and wet surfaces of soils. The imaginary refractive index obtained was highly correlated with the soil chemical properties. Especially, the correlations between the imaginary index and the free iron oxides content were sufficiently higher than those between the spectral albedo and its content, so that the imaginary index would be of some use in estimating free iron oxides content. With the advent of high spectral resolution sensors currently in design for Earth observational remote sensing from space, this result offers promising advancements in the use of multitemporal remotely sensed data, that is, the data collected when both dry and wet for soil studies.

AB The laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of vegetation is being investigated in this laboratory for use as a technique for the remote detection of the effects of environmental stress upon vegetation, as well as for plant identification.  The fluorescence band with a maximum at 440 nm, in conjunction with the chlorophyll bands with maxima at 685 and 740 nm, has been found to be a critical band in the development of algorithms for detecting stress, and identifying plant types.  The identification of the plant constituent responsible for this band is vital to understanding the mechanism underlying its fluorescence changes in response to environmental and physiological changes.  The identification was achieved as follows:  The laser induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra of pure plant pigments were determined.  Fluorescence bands with maxima at 420 nm, 440 nm, 490 nm, and 525 nm were observed for vitamin K1, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH), beta-carotene, and riboflavin, respectively.  The LIF spectra of water extracts and acetone extracts of clover leaves were also measured.  It was found that the blue fluorescence band was associated with the water extract.  NADPH which is a water-soluble compound, and the water extract of clover had no fluorescence after oxidation by potassium ferricyanide, while the fluorescence of water insoluble vitamin K1 was unchanged by the oxidizing agent.  It was also found that the absorption maximum of NADPH was the same as the absorption maximum of the aqueous extract of clover.  The above findings indicated that the compound responsible for the blue fluorescence at 440 nm is in the reduced state and is water-soluble.  It was concluded that NADPH was responsible for the blue fluorescence at 440 nm.  The strong linear relationship between the fluorescence at 440 nm and the rate of photosynthesis suggests the possible use of LIF measurements in the remote estimation of photosynthetic rates.

AB Thermal infrared remotely sensed near-surface air temperature (Ta) can provide gridded temperature information at relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions, and such measurements are thus widely used as an essential environmental parameter in numerous fields. However, data gaps caused by clouds highly restrict the applicability of remotely sensed Ta. Only a few studies have explored the production of seamless remotely sensed Ta products, and all of them estimated Ta from the gap-filled land surface temperature (LST). This study first estimates the daily minimum, average and maximum Ta of clear-sky pixels from remote sensing data over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Ningxia Autonomous Region (NAR), China, during 2016-2020, and then applies five gap-filling methods, including spatial, temporal, spatiotemporal and two multisource fusion-based gap-filling methods, to fill the data gaps in the remotely sensed Ta data. The performances of these methods under different cloud, terrain and landscape conditions are also assessed. The validation results indicate that the Temporal Fourier analysis (TFA) method exhibits high accuracy, good robustness under various cloud and surface conditions, and good ability to describe spatial details of Ta of cloud-cover areas. It is the most suitable method to fill data gaps in remotely sensed Ta. This study provides a valuable reference for selecting appropriate methods to develop seamless remotely sensed Ta products.

AB Quantifying the accuracy of the satellite-based soil moisture (SM) data is important for a number of key applications, such as: combining satellite-basedSM products for long-term SM analyses, assimilating SM data into land surface models, and providing quality flags to mask bad quality SM data. A range of statistical methods have been proposed to estimate error statistics for large-scale SM datasets including the: instrumental variable (IV) method, triple collocation analysis (TCA), and quadruple collocation analysis (QCDA). While requiring only two input products, the IV method also imposes an additional assumption that one input product possesses serially uncorrelated errors -thus limiting its scope compared to TC. Likewise, QCDA requires four independent SM data products that are difficult to obtain and may not always be available for analysis. Nonetheless, TCA-based methods still cannot provide truly global error maps for satellite SM products due to the limited number of independent SM products and difficulties with baseline TCA assumptions. Moreover, temporal sampling requirements for TCA are often impractical because of low SM retrieval skill in forested and arid areas - as well as in regions prone to radio frequency interference.Here, we seek to fill significant spatial gaps in TCA results using machine learning (ML) and therefore provide spatially complete error maps for the satellite-based SM data products derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) systems. Furthermore, we use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values, a model-agnostic technique for interpreting ML models, to examine the impact of various environmental conditions on the quality of satellite-based SM retrievals.Globally, and across all three products, 72.0% of missing error information in a TCA-based analysis, due to either the lack of valid data or the inability of TCA to provide reliable results, can be reconstructed from the ensemble prediction mean of the ML models. Overall, we found that 22.7% (a.m.) and 34.2% (p.m.) of the Earth'sSM dynamics (between 60 degrees S to 60 degrees N) have not been investigated properly across all three satellite missions.

AB The matched filter (MF) method is widely used for hyperspectral imaging spectrometers to detect and quantify methane point sources due to its high computational efficiency. However, it would result in an unavoidable underestimation, especially for large concentration enhancements. The lognormal matched filter (LMF) has provided a unique and not limited to weak methane plumes theory through lognormal background radiances modeling, but validations on simulated experiments and applications to real data remain to be explored. Moreover, the covariance contamination caused by the enhanced pixels and the surface heterogeneity have detrimental effects on the detection methods for real data application. In this study, we propose the iterative lognormal matched filter (ILMF) method to address these challenges. We evaluate the performance of the ILMF with two ideal simulations and the end-to-end simulation. The results of random simulated enhancement retrievals show that the retrieved enhancement by the ILMF method agrees well with the true enhancement, with an R2 of 0.984 and a small root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 55.856 ppb. The ILMF method reduce the RMSE of retrieved enhancement by 80% compared with the MF method. The results of end-to-end simulations show the underestimation of MF method at different sites regarding the emission rate, as well as the improvement of the ILMF method. Further, we apply the ILMF method to detect and quantify point sources in some methane hotspot regions. Our study reports the underestimation in traditional MF method and provides an unbiased and robust method for quantifying methane emissions.

AB Expansive soil is very destructive for light infrastructures, while the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), one of the most critical projects in China, has a considerable section constructed by it. The significant displacements by the expansive soil slope (ESS) lead to severe damage to the slope prevention in the SNWDP, possibly resulting in slope failure with no timely and appropriate preventive measures. In this study, taking the channel head of the middle route of the SNWDP (Henan, China) as a case, we employed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of 134 Sentinel-1 scenes spanning 2017-2021 to characterize the ground displacement on the ESS and, after that, retrieve the active zone depth (AZD) that is a significant parameter to determine the treatment depth. An elastoplastic deformation model under wetting and heating effects (EDWHE) is proposed to accurately interpret ESS's nonlinear deformation, considering the soil lags responding to wetting and heating. The results show that the excavated canal generally has positive LOS displacements, maximum to 18 mm/year, while the filled canal with negative, minimum to -25 mm/year. The InSAR results of our model show a significant improvement compared to traditional models and have a good agreement with GNSS observations. Besides, we find the movement pattern of the ESS sliding toward the slope toe, manifesting the potential risk of progressive landslide. Then, we derive the soil's elastic deformation by the EDWHE and observe that the elastic swelling and shrinkage become frequent and drastic in the monsoon season, which is the principal reason for the expansive soil geohazard. Moreover, we employ a time lag approach to retrieve the AZDs with high spatial resolution and clear distribution patterns. Our works provide a methodology to study ESS's behavior and give the possibility for detecting extensive expansive-soil geohazard and helping subsequent preventive measures.

AB Anthropogenic heat (AH) is an important input for the urban thermal environment. While reduction in AH during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may have weakened urban heat islands (UHI), quantitative assessments on this are lacking. Here, a new AH estimation method based on a remote sensing surface energy balance (RS-SEB) without hysteresis from heat storage was proposed to clarify the effects of COVID-19 control measures on AH. To weaken the impact of shadows, a simple and novel calibration method was developed to estimate the SEB in multiple regions and periods. To overcome the hysteresis of AH caused by heat storage, RS-SEB was combined with an inventory-based model and thermal stability analysis framework. The resulting AH was consistent with the latest global AH dataset and had a much higher spatial resolution, providing objective and refined features of human activities during the pandemic. Our study of four Chinese megacities (Wuhan, Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou) indicated that COVID-19 control measures severely restricted human ac-tivities and notably reduced AH. The reduction was up to 50% in Wuhan during the lockdown in February 2020 and gradually decreased after the lockdown was eased in April 2020, similar to that in Shanghai during the Level 1 pandemic response. In contrast, AH was less reduced in Guangzhou during the same period and increased in Beijing owing to extended central heating use in winter. AH decreased more in urban centers and the change in AH varied in terms of urban land use between cities and periods. Although UHI changes during the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be entirely attributed to AH changes, the considerable reduction in AH is an important feature accompanying the weakening of the UHI.

AB The impacts of global change, including extreme heat and water scarcity, are threatening an ever-growing urban world population. Evapotranspiration (ET) mitigates the urban heat island, reducing the effect of heat waves. It can also be used as a proxy for vegetation water use, making it a crucial tool to plan resilient green cities. To optimize the trade-off between urban greening and water security, reliable and up-to-date maps of ET for cities are urgently needed. Despite its importance, few studies have mapped urban ET accurately for an entire city in high spatial and temporal resolution. We mapped the ET of Berlin, Germany in high spatial (10-m) and temporal (hourly) resolution for the year of 2019. A novel machine learning (ML) approach combining Sentinel-2 time series, open geodata, and flux footprint modeling was applied. Two eddy flux towers with contrasting sur-rounding land cover provided the training and testing data. Flux footprint modeling allowed us to incorporate comprehensive land cover types in training the ML models. Open remote sensing and geodata used as model inputs included Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, building height, impervious surface fraction, vegetation fraction, and vegetation height. NDVI was used to indicate vegetation phenology and health, as plant transpiration contributes to the majority of terrestrial ET. Hourly reference ET (RET) was calculated and used as input to capture the temporal dynamics of the meteorological conditions. Predictions were carried out using Random Forest (RF) regression. Weighted averages extracted from hourly ET maps using flux footprints were compared to measured ET from the two flux towers. Validation showed that the approach is reliable for mapping urban ET, with a mean R2 of 0.76 and 0.56 and a mean RMSE of 0.0289 mm and 0.0171 mm at the more vegetated site and the city-center site, respectively. Lastly, the variation of ET between Local Climate Zones (LCZs) was analyzed to support urban planning. This study demonstrated the capacity to map urban ET at an unprecedented high spatial and temporal resolution with a novel methodology, which can be used to support the sustainable management of green infrastructure and water resources in an urbanizing world facing climate change.

AB Canopy traits play an important role in plant growth, carbon sequestration, and the land surface water and energy balance, and thus it is important to understand and monitor how these traits change over time. Canopy radiative transfer models, which use canopy traits to predict spectra, provide a powerful means to understand canopy trait variation and these models can be inverted, allowing us to use remotely sensed data to monitor canopy traits. However, a single inversion represents a snapshot in time for a single sensor. In this study, we used a Bayesian approach to assimilate snow-free observations from three different sensors (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2A and MODIS) over the course of 2019 by inverting the ProSAIL radiative transfer model, producing a robust estimate of six canopy traits and their joint uncertainties at each time point. Next, we used a state-space time series model to integrate observations from multiple sensors to capture variation in vegetation optical traits throughout the year. The results demonstrate that our model can capture seasonal variation of surface reflectance with less than 5% RMSE compared with observed reflectance. Moreover, linking observations in time narrows the uncertainty intervals compared to the posterior distributions for individual time points. We are also able to make statistical inferences on dates when no data is available, and provide reasonable and reliable time-series inversion results compared with LAI ground measurements.

AB Accurate building change detection is crucial for understanding urban development. Although fully supervised deep learning-based methods for building change detection have made progress, they tend to fuse temporal information only at a single level (e.g., input, feature, or decision levels) to mitigate the data distribution differences between time-series images, which is highly prone to introduce a large number of pseudo changes. Moreover, these methods rely on a large number of high-quality pixel-level change labels with high acquisition costs. In contrast, available crowdsourced building data are abundant but are less considered for change detection. For example, OpenStreetMap (OSM), Google Map, and Gaode Map provide lots of available building labels, yet they usually contain noise such as false alarms, omissions, and mismatches, limiting their wide application. In addition, when the building extraction task is transferred to the building change detection task, the temporal and regional differences between different images may lead to undesired pseudo changes. Given these issues, we propose a full-level fused cross-task transfer learning method for building change detection using only crowdsourced building labels and high-resolution satellite imagery. The method consists of three steps: 1) noise-robust building extraction network pretraining; 2) uncertainty-aware pseudo label generation; and 3) fulllevel fused building change detection. We created building extraction and building change detection datasets. The former (building extraction dataset) contains 30 scenes of ZY-3 images covering 27 major cities in China and crowdsourced building labels from Gaode Map for training, while the latter (building change dataset) contains bi-temporal ZY-3 images in Shanghai and Beijing for testing. The results show that the proposed method can identify changed buildings more effectively and better balance false alarms and omissions, compared to the existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis indicates that the inclusion of samples from multiple cities with various spatial heterogeneities is helpful to improve the performance. The experiments show that it is promising to apply the proposed method to situations where true labels are completely lacking or limited, thus alleviating the issue of high label acquisition cost.

AB Directional area scattering factor (DASF) is a critical canopy structural parameter for vegetation monitoring as it provides an efficient tool for detection of vegetation functional traits and their dynamics. Current standard approach to estimate DASF from canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) is based on the assumption that in the weakly absorbing 710 to 790 nm spectral interval, leaf scattering does not change much with the concentration of dry matter and thus its variation can be neglected. This results in biased estimates of DASF and consequently leads to uncertainty in DASF-related applications. This study proposes a new approach to account for variations in concentrations of this biochemical constituent, which additionally uses the canopy BRF at 2260 nm. Analysis of the proposed approach based on radiative transfer models suggests significant decrease in relative root mean square error (rRMSE) by nearly a half for one- and three dimensional dense vegetated scenes, and the improvement is insensitive to the reflectivity of background. Robust refinement is also achieved in a larger actual forest scene. When the new approach is adopted to indoor multi-angular hyperspectral measurements on individual tree crowns, the relative error has also reduced, with more improvement seen in needle-leaf than in broadleaf species. Thus, the proposed DASF estimation approach outperforms the current one and can be used more reliably in DASF-related applications, such as retrieval of vegetation biochemical contents, grasping periodic changes of equatorial forests, and other ecological and environmental vegetation monitoring tasks based on spectral invariants theory.

AB The surface temperature is one of the main parameters for assessing climate change. Temperature change is most pronounced in the Arctic, and therefore, it is crucial to accurately estimate sea and sea ice surface temperatures in this region. The availability of in situ observations is limited in the Arctic, thus, increasing the need for satellite observations to estimate surface temperatures. We present the first Arctic (>58 & DEG;N) gap-free climate dataset covering the surface temperatures of the ocean, sea ice and the marginal ice zone from 1 January 1982 to 31 May 2021 based on observations from infrared satellite sensors. The underlying algorithm combines the multi satellite observations and performs a statistical optimal interpolation to obtain daily gap-free fields, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 & DEG; in latitude and longitude. In situ observations have been used to derive consistent validation statistics over the ocean and sea ice. Comparison of the derived sea surface temperatures against in situ measurements from drifting buoys, moored buoys and Argo floats shows mean differences of 0.01 & DEG;C, 0.04 & DEG;C and 0.04 & DEG;C and standard deviations of 0.54 & DEG;C, 0.56 & DEG;C and 0.51 & DEG;C, respectively. Over sea ice, the derived ice surface temperatures have been compared with KT-19 measurements from IceBridge flights, showing a mean difference of 1.52 & DEG;C and standard deviation of 3.12 & DEG;C, and with air temperatures from the North Pole (NP) ice drifting stations as well as ECMWF distributed buoys and CRREL buoys, with mean differences of-2.35 & DEG;C,-3.21 & DEG;C and -2.87 & DEG;C and standard deviations of 3.12 & DEG;C, 3.34 & DEG;C and 3.36 & DEG;C, respectively. The combination of sea and sea-ice surface temperature provides a consistent dataset for climate analysis, which is crucial for studying climate change and trends in the Arctic. The combined sea and sea-ice surface temperature of the Arctic has risen with about 4.5 & DEG;C over the period 1982-2021, with a peak warming of around 10 & DEG;C in the northeastern Barents Sea.

AB Satellite measurements have largely improved sea surface salinity (SSS) observations in the recent decade, including Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Aquarius/Sate ' lite de Aplicaciones Cientificas (SAC) -D, and Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP). This study evaluates the deviations between the satellite SSS products and the in-situ observations (Delta S) and analyses their relationships with the environmental factors, including sea surface temperature (SST), precipitation, and wind speed. The level 3 satellite SSS generally correlates well with Argo -observed SSS but differs in the middle and high latitudes and the tropical convergence zones. The smallest Delta S appears in the subtropical open oceans, where the sea surface features warm SST, rare precipitation, and low wind speed. The variations in mean |Delta S| for the three satellites show a robust dependence on SST, precipitation, and wind, with large Delta S (outside 5%-95% interval) in particular tending to occur in areas of cold SST, heavy rainfall, and high wind speeds. The most pronounced SSS deviations occur in the middle and high latitudes (beyond 40 degrees) due to cold SST. In particular, heavy rainfall in the subpolar regions and strong westerly winds in the mid-latitudes also make the satellite SSS measurements less accurate. In the tropical convergence zones, large SSS deviations are mainly related to heavy rainfall, showing significant surface freshening. The fresh biases related to rainfall are more significant in Level 2 SSS than in Level 3, due to the short period of the convective rainfall. In addition, surface freshening is more obvious in low wind speed scenarios, showing that the fresh skin layer induced by rain is more common on the calm ocean surface.

AB This study investigates the different performances between Compact-Polarimetric (CP) and Full-Polarimetric (FP) SAR to retrieve multiple crop growth parameters including Vegetation Water Content (VWC), Leaf Area Index (LAI), height, and dry biomass. The objective is to study at which conditions the CP SAR can obtain comparable retrieval accuracy as FP SAR for specific crop types and growth descriptors. Polarimetric decompositions were used to extract CP and FP explanatory variables to quantify crop growth status. Then, the sensitivities of CP and FP variables to different crop descriptors were analyzed, revealing higher sensitivity to height than LAI, VWC, and dry biomass. In order to reduce the information redundancy of sets of CP and FP SAR variables, Partial Least Square (PLS) approach was used to develop new orthogonal SAR parameters, while Step-Wise Regression (SWR) was used to determine the optimal SAR parameters, followed by retrievals of multiple crop growth descriptors using the developed estimators. Validated by the ground measurements, the retrieval performances are found to be highly dependent on polarimetry dimension (CP or FP), crop types, and targeted crop descriptors. With crop growth and enhanced depolarization effects, the CP SAR can capture the increasing volume power and decreasing surface power but at a lower rate than FP SAR. The m-delta and m-chi decompositions provide similar scattering components which differ from the Random Volume Over Ground (RVOG) decomposition. The third Stokes parameter g3 of the CP SAR data that indicates the strength of the circular polarization component is a common important parameter to infer the multiple crop parameters of interest. In agreement with the sensitivity analysis, better retrieval accuracies were obtained for height and dry biomass than VWC and LAI. For short vegetation such as soybean, full polarimetry is required to obtain the estimates of all four crop growth de -scriptors. On the contrary, for tall crop growth parameters, such as canola (height and dry biomass), corn (height, VWC, dry biomass), and wheat (LAI, VWC, dry biomass), the CP SAR features can provide comparable robust retrieval accuracy as the FP SAR features. This study deepens our insights into the CP SAR of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) to timely monitor crop growth and health status.

AB Snow melt onset detection and mapping of snow extent during the spring melt period using spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is important for various applications including understanding and predicting snowmelt runoff, flood hazard risk, and freshwater resource supply. In this study, we investigated the time-series evolution of RADARSAT-2 C-band HH, VV, VH and HV radar backscattering coefficients and scattering contributions during the spring melt seasons of 2017 and 2018 over the Niaqunguk (Apex) River, Nunavut, Canada. Meteo-rological observations and optical Planet satellite images were analyzed to support interpretations of SAR data in relation to snowpack warming and melt processes at the high spatial resolution of 6 m. Our results suggest that the cross-polarization (HV and VH) backscatter from snow significantly dropped by-10.7 dB when the air temperatures became positive and snowpack moisture content began to increase (i.e., melt onset). Co -polarization (HH and VV) backscatter from snow also decreased, but by a smaller magnitude of-7.4 dB. Freeman-Durden decomposition analysis suggested that the volume scattering contribution dropped drastically, and surface scattering dominated at the melt onset. The timing of melt onset can be readily inferred from the temporal changes in backscatter signal, which was particularly pronounced in the HV time-series. The back -scatter decrease (e.g., 2.5 dB for HH and 3.4 dB for HV) associated with melt onset was also pronounced for large areas, where both snow-covered and snow-free surfaces were present, and water was masked out. Cross -polarization signal demonstrated better separability between snow-free and snow-covered surfaces than co -polarization signal throughout the melt season. This suggests that the HV backscatter signal is more suitable for snow melt onset and snow/ground detection compared to conventionally used HH and VV, given the in-strument noise floor is sufficiently low to capture the HV signal variations. Our classification results demon-strated slightly higher overall accuracy for HV (83.9%) than for HH (82.7%) signal. However, snow and bare -ground classification accuracies were limited to the late season period when class separabilities were lower compared to the earlier melt season, preventing robust assessment of classification accuracy using HV back -scatter due to limited ground truth data.

AB The bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) is a plant pathogen that can block the flow of water and nutrients through the xylem. Xf symptoms may be confounded with generic water stress responses. Here, we assessed changes in biochemical, biophysical and photosynthetic traits, inferred using biophysical models, in Xf-affected almond orchards under rainfed and irrigated conditions on the Island of Majorca (Balearic Islands, Spain). Recent research has demonstrated the early detection of Xf-infections by monitoring spectral changes associated with pigments, canopy structural traits, fluorescence emission and transpiration. Nevertheless, there is still a need to make further progress in monitoring physiological processes (e.g., photosynthesis rate) to be able to efficiently detect when Xf-infection causes subtle spectral changes in photosynthesis. This paper explores the ability of parsimonious machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect Xf-infected trees operationally, when considering a proxy of photosynthetic capacity, namely the maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax), along with carbon-based constituents (CBC, including lignin), and leaf biochemical traits and tree-crown temperature (Tc) as an indica-tor of transpiration rates. The ML framework proposed here reduced the uncertainties associated with the extraction of reflectance spectra and temperature from individual tree crowns using high-resolution hyper -spectral and thermal images. We showed that the relative importance of Vcmax and leaf biochemical constituents (e.g., CBC) in the ML model for the detection of Xf at early stages of development were intrinsically associated with the water and nutritional conditions of almond trees. Overall, the functional traits that were most consis-tently altered by Xf-infection were Vcmax, pigments, CBC, and Tc, and, particularly in rainfed-trees, anthocyanins, and Tc. The parsimonious ML model for Xf detection yielded accuracies exceeding 90% (kappa = 0.80). This study brings progress in the development of an operational ML framework for the detection of Xf outbreaks based on plant traits related to photosynthetic capacity, plant biochemistry and structural decay parameters.

AB Various types of floating macroalgae and other floating matters have been reported in the global oceans and inland waters, and their remote detection has relied primarily on passive optical sensors. These sensors provide multiple spectral bands and frequent revisits, yet they all suffer from clouds. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagers are active sensors that overcome this obstacle, yet their capacity in detecting macroalgae and other floating matters is generally unknown. Here, through statistical analysis and comparison of the Sentinel-2/MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) and Sentinel-1/SAR imagery, we attempt to fill this knowledge gap. The types of floating matters considered in this study include macroalgae (Ulva Prolifera in the Yellow Sea, Sargassum horneri in the East China Sea, and Sargassum fluitans/natans in the Caribbean Sea), cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Nodularia spumigena, and Trichodesmium), dinoflagellates (green and red Noctiluca), organic matters (sea snots and brine shrimp cysts), and marine debris (driftwood). Of these, the only floating matter that can be definitively detected in Sentinel-1/SAR imagery is U. prolifera, followed by the occasional detection of S. fluitans/natans and driftwood. In all detection cases, the macroalgae features always appear in Sentinel-1/SAR imagery with positive contrast from the surrounding waters. Because of the all-weather measurements, SAR observations can therefore complement those from the optical sensors in monitoring and tracking U. prolifera and S. fluitans/natans in their respective regions.

AB Phaeocystis globosa (P. globosa hereafter) is a phytoplankton species which commonly blooms at high biomass in April-May in the Southern North Sea and forms undesirable foam which accumulates on the beaches. Monitoring of this species is required by EU directives. Measurement of phytoplankton species composition has historically been made by pigment or microscopic analysis of water samples, which is spatially sparse and temporally infrequent e.g. weekly/monthly. In-water instruments such as flow cytometers can provide very high frequency data but at high acquisition and maintenance cost. Automated in situ above water radiometry has the potential to provide very high frequency data at single locations but requires very careful design of processing algorithms in turbid waters with high non-algal absorption. Spaceborne radiometry could provide both very good spatial coverage and moderate/high frequency of data, e.g. daily/weekly, but accurate determination of phytoplankton species composition is considerably more difficult in turbid waters than in open ocean waters. Prior studies based on a limited number of shipborne reflectance measurements suggested feasibility of P. globosa detection in turbid waters from hyperspectral radiometry. The availability of a new autonomous above water hyperspectral radi-ometer system has enabled further refinement and intensive testing of these techniques. From a time-series of 4356 water reflectance spectra measured near Ostend harbour in Belgian coastal waters from 2020/04/01 to 2020/08/18, two existing algorithms for P. globosa detection were successfully applied. Results show a high biomass P. globosa bloom occurring in late-April/early-May as found every year in water sample analyses for Belgian coastal waters. The high temporal resolution of the radiometric data allows to capture the evolution of the bloom at time scales sufficiently short (hourly and daily) compared to growth/decay and tidal processes. The challenges of extending the methods to future spaceborne instruments are also tested by simulating the impact of errors in sensor inter-band calibration, atmospheric correction and radiometric noise. Results show that because of their spectral coherence, atmospheric correction errors impact only slightly P. globosa detection whereas inaccuracy in inter-band calibration and radiometric noise are much more problematic as they affect each spectral band independently. Because radiometric noise should be reduced in the new generation of hyperspectral sensors and can always be reduced by spatial binning, the inter-band relative calibration uncer-tainty appears to be the main challenge for spaceborne mission design. Indeed, it was demonstrated that inter -band calibration error should be <0.25% and ideally 0.1% at top of the atmosphere highlighting the need for particular attention to inter-band calibration in sensor design and post processing treatments including vicarious calibration.

DE GNSS-R; Coastal sea level; Meteorological forcing; Storm surges

AB We propose to derive local sea level variations by using the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the GNSS reflected signals at four GNSS single antenna sites (ILDG, TAR0, FFT2, LYTT) located at different latitudes. For these sites representing various ocean conditions (waves, tides, storm surges, etc...), tides estimates by SNR are highly consistent to tide gauges records as highlighted by tidal harmonic analysis, with a Root-Sum-Square (RSS) ranging from few centimeter in micro-tidal environment to near a decimeter in macro-tidal environment. SNR non-tidal residuals (NTR) are compared to two modelled sea level responses to meteorological forcing, namely the analytical Local Inverse Barometer (LIB) model and the numerical Dynamic Atmospheric Correction (DAC). Both DAC and LIB models are coherent with this non-tidal SNR residual in a 2-days to 2-months time window with correlations reaching 0.7 and high coherences. Several noteworthy atmospheric events are observed in the time series of about one year. During intense events, SNR and models are highly correlated. According to the results obtained in this study, we conclude that the GNSS reflectometry technique is relevant to derive sea level variations at tidal periods but also for studying the behaviour of the sea surface in response to atmospheric forcing at short-term scales.

AB Large-scale coastal bathymetry is paramount to understand natural and human-induced coastal behaviour and plays a vital role in coastal research and governance. Here, we use a recently developed algorithm, S2Shores (Satellite to Shores), to invert coastal bathymetry from wave kinematics, based on the linear dispersion relation. Wave numbers and celerity are extracted from optical Sentinel-2 imagery, by exploiting the small temporal offset between the image bands of its Multi-Spectral Instrument. Inverted depths are output at 200 m resolution, and individual depth points are merged to create a composite bathymetry using a weighted average of images from 10 different dates. The resulting bathymetry mosaic spans 4000 km along the West African coast. S2Shores is able to detect depths up to 35 m, depending on mean incident wave conditions and cloud cover, which varies by location. Underwater features are well reproduced by S2Shores, such as flow channels in Guinea, the St. Ann's Shoal in Sierra Leone, and ebb delta lobes at several outlets along the Niger River Delta. S2Shores results match well (r2 = 0.76, RMSE = 4.9 m) with a bathymetry survey along the Senegalese coast. As a difference with traditional satellite-derived bathymetry methods based on water colour, a wave-based approach allows estimations in turbid areas and relatively deep waters, which suggest that the two approaches are complementary and should be used in combination to cover coastal environments in their diversity. The new possibility offered by this regional coastal atlas opens the door to increased research and planning capabilities and sets an example that can be applied to the rest of the world.

AB We present a new seasonal planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) climatology product derived from 14 years of Global Navigation Satellite System radio occultation (GNSS-RO) data from multiple missions including COSMIC, TerraSAR-X, KOMPSAT-5, and PAZ. PBLH estimates are derived from the minimum gradients of retrieved refractivity profiles, with a vertical resolution of ~200 m. The climatology is obtained from occultations observed between June 2006 and December 2019, and is divided into land and ocean regimes on a 2-degree grid. We provide seasonal climatologies at 2-degree resolution as well as climatologies of diurnal cycle amplitude and phase at 5-degree resolution. The new GNSS PBLH climatology is compared to radiosonde data from the shipbased Marine ARM GPCI Investigation of Clouds (MAGIC) campaign in the subtropical northeast Pacific ocean and to previous GNSS PBLH climatology estimates. The higher spatial resolution reveals new details such as seasonal PBLH modulation due to sea ice off the coast of Antarctica. The PBLH product is the first publicly available at 2-degree resolution.

DE CFOSAT; Scatterometer; Backscatter; Rain effects; Wind quality
ID DESIGN; WAVES; ASCAT; OCEAN
AB The Ku-band scatterometer onboard China France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT) observes the sea surface with two conically scanning fan beams. Compared to the prior Ku-band pencil beam scatterometers, this innovative observing mechanism provides more independent backscatter measurements at varying incidence and azimuth angles, as such it brings challenges for the sea surface wind inversion, particularly under rainy conditions. In this paper, the rain effects on the CFOSAT SCATterometer (CSCAT) are investigated using the collocated numerical weather prediction (NWP) wind data and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) microwave imager (GMI) rain data. Similar to the prior Ku-band or C-band scatterometers, the sensitivity of CSCAT radar backscatter to rain substantially varies with wind speed, radar polarization and incidence angle. However, due to the complex observation geometries, rain effects on the CSCAT retrieved winds is more complex than that of prior scatterometers, which may lead to a remarkable underestimation of CSCAT wind speed at high winds and heavy rain conditions. A simple simulation method is used to clarify the relation between the retrieved wind speed and the dependency of radar rain effects on the incidence angle. It is found that the backscatter measurements at low incidence angles, which are generally underestimated at high winds and heavy rainy conditions, have a larger influence on the wind inversion minimization, leading to much lower retrieved wind speeds than those of ECMWF and the pencil beam scatterometer (e.g., Haiyang-2B scattometer). Under low and moderate rain conditions though, a more compensated effect between low and high incidence angle measurements is found, leading to generally unbiased CSCAT high winds, in contrast to the generally underestimated pencil-beam scatterometer winds.

AB With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, machine-learning has been used broadly in surface ozone retrievals. However, the accuracies of current machine-learning-based models tend to rely largely on the spatial and temporal patterns of the site observations of surface ozone instead of the internal physical and chemical mechanisms of ozone, which also limit the transferability of the retrieval models. In this study, the surface ultraviolet (UV) at 380 nm, which is an important component of the rate-determining step of ozone photochemical production, is involved as an indicator in the newly developed surface ozone retrieval algorithm. And the imputation of missing satellite observations of ozone nitrogen dioxide (NO2) column and surface UV is conducted to obtain spatially continuous surface ozone. Different validation schemes and case studies are used to comprehensively evaluate the new algorithm. With the involvement of the surface UV, the new retrieval algorithm shows the high accuracy (R2 = 0.853 and RMSE = 17.09 mu g/m3) in spatially continuous surface ozone estimation. More significantly, the new algorithm shows outstanding spatial transferability, which has been a critical challenge for machine-learning models on surface ozone estimation.

AB Remote sensing technology has been frequently used to obtain information on changes in urban land cover because of its vast spatial coverage and timeliness of observation. Block-level change detection with high tem-poral resolution image data provides fine detail of urban changes, is suitable for urban management, and has gradually received widespread attention. High-dimensional features are required to express the heterogeneous structure of the blocks. High-dimensional high-frequency time series, namely, multivariate time series, are formed by arranging high-dimensional features chronologically. Classic change detection methods treat multi-variate time series as univariate time series one by one. Few studies have analyzed the change in a multivariate time series by considering all variables as an entirety. Therefore, a graph-based segmentation for multivariate time series algorithm (MTS-GS) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, 1) we construct a similarity matrix to explore the changing patterns of multivariate time series for seasonal change, trend change, abrupt change, and noise disturbance; 2) a multivariate time series graph is defined based on the changing patterns; and 3) the corresponding graph segmentation algorithm is proposed in the paper to detect the abrupt and trend changes under noise and seasonal disturbances. Sentinel-2 images of the rapidly developing third-tier city of Luoyang, Henan province, China, are adopted to validate the algorithm. The F1-score in the spatial domain is 84.1%; the producer's and the user's accuracy in the temporal dimension are 81.8% and 80.1%, respectively. Seven change types are defined and extracted, showing the development pattern and the efficiency of land use in the city. Furthermore, the proposed MTS-GS can be used for pixel-level change detection and performs well under various time intervals and cloud covers.

AB Knowledge of ice thickness and its distribution is of great interest to plan ship and offshore operations in ice areas. It is also a major direct factor in climate change. However, it is currently the most inaccurate sea-ice parameter according to a large majority of the scientific community. Satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are highly valuable for monitoring daily ice-covered oceans. In this study, we develop a new technique based on a machine learning Random Forest (RF) regression approach using the combination of the in-situ thickness measurements and the backscattering information from Sentinel-1 to retrieve the level first-year ice (FYI) thickness. By applying the technique over the Sentinel-1 ground range detected (GRD) data set available in Google Earth Engine (GEE) over the Beaufort Sea spanning a time period from Apr 2015 to Sep 2018, a thickness of up to 1.5 m with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 22 cm is retrieved.

TI Addressing critical influences on L-band radar backscatter for improved
   estimates of basal area and change

AB L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter intensity is sensitive to land cover and can be used to estimate vegetation measures such as basal area (BA) and biomass. However, the estimation of BA, and especially change in BA, can be hampered by the influences upon backscatter of external factors such as imaging geometry, terrain topology, prevailing moisture conditions and even SAR sensor characteristics. This paper describes a method of reducing the adverse effects of such extraneous influences on vegetation and change estimates derived from single-channel SAR data. Empirical corrections for terrain slope and cross-track tendencies were applied and linear least squares difference minimization used to normalize the backscatter differences between scenes. The method was applied to state-wide coverage of L-band, fine-mode, HV polarization Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) data over New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The data were acquired with different sensors over two "observational epochs": ALOS PALSAR in 2009 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 in 2016/17. The SAR datasets presented significant variations in backscatter intensity beyond those attributable to changes in vegetation cover. The corrective procedures resulted in improved uniformity of observed backscatter dependence on vegetation. Variations in backscattering coefficient between swaths were reduced by as much as 1.75 dB and 25% of the standard deviation in mean backscattering coefficients in common areas and at near- and far-range. This corresponded to a correction in BA estimate of 4.4 m2 ha-1. The method was observed to reduce ambiguities in regrowth estimates at swath boundaries and correct estimates of BA change by as much as 30% over large areas. The resulting estimates of 7-year change in BA provide spatially explicit forest structural information that is assisting in monitoring changes in woody vegetation across NSW.

AB Phytoplankton community composition impacts food webs, climate, and fisheries on regional and global scales, and can be assessed at coarse taxonomic resolution from biomarker pigments measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Presently, satellite ocean color provides unprecedented coverage of the global surface ocean and offers reliable estimates of bulk biological properties; however, existing multispectral sensors have limited ability to provide information about phytoplankton community composition. Satellite ocean color at hyperspectral resolution (e.g., NASA's upcoming Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, and ocean Ecosystem sensor, PACE) is expected to improve estimates of phytoplankton community composition from space. Phytoplankton impact ocean color via contributions to absorption and fluorescence (through phytoplankton pigments) and scattering, especially on narrow spectral scales (5-100 nm). Here, a global open ocean dataset of concurrent HPLC pigments and hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) observations is used to model phytoplankton pigment composition from optical data. Phytoplankton pigments are reconstructed from R-rs(lambda) using optimized principal components regression modeling. This work demonstrates that thirteen phytoplankton pigments, representing five phytoplankton pigment groups (e.g., diatoms, dinoflagellates, haptophytes, green algae, and cyanobacteria), can be modeled from hyperspectral R-rs(lambda). Spectral information needed to model each phytoplankton pigment concentration is found throughout the entire visible spectrum and the model results are best at high spectral resolution (<= 5 nm). The resulting model recreates observed relationships among pigment concentrations, providing support for the designation of five pigment-based phytoplankton groups for the global open ocean. This work represents a step toward developing robust, global spectral models for phytoplankton pigment composition. However, more high-quality data from a wide range of ecosystems and environments are still needed to achieve this goal.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a promising new tool for remotely estimating photosynthesis. However, the degree to which incoming solar radiation and the structure of the canopy rather than leaf physiology contribute to SIF variations is still not well characterized. Therefore, we investigated relationships between SIF and variables that at least partly capture the canopy structure component of SIF. For this, we relied on high-quality SIF observations from ground-based instruments, high-resolution airborne SIF imagery and the most recent satellite SIF products to cover large ranges in spatial and temporal resolution and diverse ecosystems. We found that the canopy structure-related near-infrared reflectance of vegetation multiplied by incoming sunlight (NIRvP) is a robust proxy for far-red SIF across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Our findings indicate that contributions from leaf physiology to SIF variability are small compared to the structure and radiation components. Also, NIRvP captured spatio-temporal patterns of canopy photosynthesis better than SIF, which seems to be mostly due to the greater retrieval noise of SIF. Compared to other relevant structural SIF proxies, NIRvP showed more robust relationships to SIF, especially at the global scale. Our results highlight the promise of using widely available NIRvP data for vegetation monitoring and also indicate the potential of using SIF and NIRvP in combination to extract physiological information from SIF.

AB The combination of Unmanned/Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data and deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offers robust new tools for precision land cover mapping. However, its successful application is highly dependent on local experiences that are rarely documented, resulting in practical limitations during implementation. Cost-effective deep learning frameworks for fast deployment are required. This study presents a deep learning adaptation framework, named Auto-UNet++, trying to streamline wetland mapping tasks (including training data labeling and organizing). The framework treats mapping tasks as an intact semantic segmentation pipeline and then integrates automatic strategies into each step to reduce human intervention. These automatic strategies are achieved by standard computer vision techniques, including multi-view (MV) imaging-highly overlapped UAV images over an area (for labeling/voting), unsupervised clustering (for labeling), multi-scale CNN (for feature extraction), and attention mechanism-a CNN design used to select informative features from input (for feature exploration/selection). The framework was tested on playa wetland mapping in the Rainwater Basin, Nebraska, USA, with multispectral UAV datasets. Generally, the multi-scale CNN mapping task achieved a high of 87% overall accuracy and over 90% accuracy in water delineation. The results indicate that the multi-view and attention strategies have the potential to improve segmentation performance, and together with unsupervised learning, save considerable labor/expertise. Interestingly, evidence shows that the band/scale attention (weight) is adaptively associated with the land cover percentages per input image, indicating spatial contexts captured. This finding highlights the potential usages of the attention rule in automatic feature exploration, selection, and model interpretation. The framework illustrating a highly automated deep learning deployment on small MV datasets facilitates cost-effective wetland cover mapping. Although limitations exist, the study demonstrated the possibility of where/how conventional segmentation pipelines can be improved in typical UAV wetland mapping tasks. The framework and findings are useful for similar applications (including non-UAV studies) that only have limited time, labor, and expertise to implement sophisticated semantic segmentation models.

AB There are several long-term statistical researches using the Molchan diagram (MD) to prove the relation between thermal infrared (TIR) anomalies and earthquakes in different regions, however, these studies are flawed: 1) the original MD is based on the spatially uniform Poisson model, but it will offer wrong evaluations for inhomogenous systems with uneven spatial-temporal distribution of earthquakes; 2) some of these studies have de clustered earthquake catalogs before applying MD, however, de-clustering will introduce ambiguities to final scores and it may also conceal the potential relation between precursors and the 'removed' events. Until now, we have to admit that the long-term statistical evidence for proving the correspondence between earthquake and TIR anomalies is still absent and the power of TIR anomalies for predicting earthquakes is limited. In this study, we use daily nighttime Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) data provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to extract the TIR anomalies of Chinese Mainland (20 degrees-54 degrees N, 73 degrees-135 degrees E). The data from Jan. 2007 to Dec. 2010 is the training dataset to obtain the best parameters for extracting TIR anomalies and the best time-distance-magnitude (TDM) windows for determining the correspondence between earthquakes and TIR anomalies, and the data from Jan. 2011 to Dec. 2017 is the testing dataset. The new 3D Molchan diagram offers a score for each model with different parameters. Unlike the original MD that only deals with the rate of missed events and the size of warning space, the 3D Molchan diagram quantifies the errors including false alarms and missed predictions. We assume that the best parameters and TDM windows are spatially variable for different sub-regions, because the Signal/Noise ratio is spatially variable due to the different geological and meteorological backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a new probability prediction model based on non-seismic binary alarms. Results show that the TIR anomalies is strongly related to normal or reverse earthquakes with magnitude >= 4.0, and the TIR anomalies caused by earthquakes should be persistent in space and time. Moreover, the spatially variable model is superior to the global invariant one. We succeed in transforming the non-seismic binary alarms into probabilistic predictions based on the TIR anomalies and Relative Intensity index, which is defined as the rate of past earthquakes occurring in each spatial cell. Moreover, our new probabilistic model is superior to the spatially inhomogeneous Poisson model. However, this new probability model is still naive and weak, and needs to be improved in the future.

AB Plant water use is difficult to monitor and predict in complex terrain. NASA's ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) provides new data for understanding hydrologic cycling in these forested mountain areas. Evaluation of ECOSTRESS evapotranspiration (ET) has relied primarily on eddy flux towers, but most flux towers are located in flat terrain, sampling relatively homogeneous vegetation. To address this knowledge gap, the accuracy of the ECOSTRESS land surface temperature (L2_LST) and ET (L3_ET_PT-JPL) data were evaluated against data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service's Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory: a humid temperate forest ecosystem in the southern Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern U.S. with extensive data from one eddy covariance tower and five climate stations varying in elevation. ECOSTRESS LST showed a strong linear relationship with the weather station near-surface air temperature (R-2 = 0.85; offset =-2.5 degrees C), showing no difference across slope, aspect and elevation, but a higher correlation during the night than the day. ECOSTRESS tended to overestimate ET compared with our site eddy covariance measurements (R-2 = 0.43; RMSE = 146 W m(-2)). To evaluate potential sources of error associated with remotely-sensed inputs to the ECOSTRESS Priestly-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) ET model, we ran PT-JPL using ground-based data from our site. ET estimated with locally-collected data showed much better performance in capturing variability (R-2 similar to 0.70), illustrating the uncertainty contributed to ECOSTRESS by the coarse scale meteorological inputs in areas of complex topography. Notably, both the ECOSTRESS LST and ET captured important topographic gradients and spatially-explicit diurnal variability. The valley floor of the Coweeta Basin was warmer than the higher elevations by 8 degrees C in the day, but cooler at night. On the south facing aspects, LST and ET were higher, consistent with observations. This also highlights the ability of ECOSTRESS and PT-JPL to decouple ET from LST when and where appropriate, as they are normally inverse to one another. Our study provides the first detailed analysis of ECOSTRESS for forested ecosystems in complex terrain and offers insight for future evaluation.

AB Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water from remote sensing imagery is essential for understanding water's impact on the global ecosystem and climate change. There is often a tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions of imagery acquired from current satellite sensors and as such various spatiotemporal image fusion methods have been explored to circumvent the challenges this situation presents (e.g., STARFM). However, some challenges persist in mapping surface water at the desired fine spatial and temporal resolution. Principally, the spatiotemporal changes of water bodies are often abrupt and controlled by topographic conditions, which are usually unaddressed in current spatiotemporal image fusion methods. This paper proposes the SpatioTemporal Surface Water Mapping (STSWM) method, which aims to predict Landsat-like, 30 m, surface water maps at an 8-day time step (same as the MODIS 8-day composite product) by integrating topographic information into the analysis. In addition to MODIS imagery acquired on the date of map prediction and a pair of MODIS and Landsat images acquired temporally close to the date of prediction, STSWM also uses the surface water occurrence (SWO, which represents the frequency with which water is present in a pixel) and DEM data to provide, respectively, topographic information below and above the water surface. These data are used to translate the coarse spatial resolution water distribution representation observed by MODIS into a 30 m spatial resolution water distribution map. The STSWM was used to generate an 8-day time series surface water maps of 30 m resolution in six inundation regions globally, and was compared with several other state-of-the-art spatiotemporal methods. The stratified random sampling design was used, and unbiased estimators of the accuracies were provided. The results show that STSWM generated the most accurate surface water map in which the spatial details of surface water were well-represented.

AB ElectroMagnetic (EM) reasons resulting in temperature dependence of L-band Vegetation Optical Depth (L-VOD) are currently overlooked in remote sensing products. Discrepancies in retrievals of geophysical surface properties over vegetated areas can result from this incompleteness. This perception motivated to explore EM considerations in how temperature drives L-VOD of a boreal forest. Thereto, a novel physics-based model is developed and evaluated to assess L-VOD sensitivities to canopy temperature and some other model parameters. The L-VOD model is compared to L-VOD derived from close-range L-band brightness temperatures measured through the tree canopy at the Finnish Meteorological Institute's Arctic Research Center (FMI-ARC) in Sodankyla center dot (Finland) during a 4-week and a 1-day period in 2019. Furthermore, the model's ability to explain L-VOD retrieved from brightness temperatures of the "Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity" (SMOS) satellite over the "Sodankyla center dot grid cell" is investigated. Experimental L-VOD are maximal at around 0 degrees C and decrease when canopy temperature is moving away from zero degree Celsius. This temperature response, observed at different temporal- and spatial scales, is captured by the proposed L-VOD model and explained by freezing tree sap-water and the dependence of water permittivity on temperature. The demonstrated EM-induced temperature dependence suggest caution with interpreting satellite-based L-VOD, because increased L-VOD around the freezing point is not solely due to increased biomass or rehydration of the vegetation. Further, our study can find future application to compensate L-VOD for EM-induced temperature sensitivity. This potentially leads to improved explanatory power of temperature normalized L-VOD for characterization of forest phenology. Furthermore, we suggest examining the presence and strength of the demonstrated L-VOD temperature response as a practical L-VOD retrieval quality assessment method under steady forest phenology.

AB Parametric kernel-driven models are crucial for operationally adjusting satellite-derived urban land surface temperatures (LSTs) obtained at slant angles to hemispherically-representative values. Various parametric models have been proposed to simulate urban thermal radiation directionality, but a comprehensive comparison of the performances of the published parametric models, especially over a variety of urban surfaces under different solar radiation conditions, remains lacking. It is also unknown whether the combination of the available hotspot and base shape kernels can be used to derive new parametric models with even better performances compared with existing models. Based on both forward-modelling and satellite datasets, here we systematically evaluate three single-kernel and eight dual-kernel parametric models. The main findings are as follows: (1) Amongst the three single-kernel models, the VIN model has the best overall performance, with an average rootmean-square error (RMSE) of 0.79 and 1.35 K, based on forward-modelling and satellite data, respectively. However, the ROU and RL models outperform the VIN model when the solar zenith angle is less than 30 degrees, and in particular it has a higher accuracy for hotspot description. (2) The dual-kernel models usually perform better than the single-kernel models. Amongst the eight dual-kernel models, those with the hotspot kernel KHotspot_rou (used by the ROU model) are more competent than those using KHotspot_vin (obtained from the Vinnikov model) as the hotspot kernel. The RVI model, in general, has the highest accuracy, with average RMSEs of 0.49 and 0.77 K based on forward-modelling and satellite data, respectively. (3) Compared with the single- and dual-kernel models, the multi-kernel models sometimes have better accuracies but the performance improvements are relatively limited. We also provide recommendations for model selection under various scenarios. Our systematic assessment improves our understanding of urban thermal radiation directionality regimes and potentially enables the improved correction of remotely-sensed urban LSTs, thus helping to advance thermal remote sensing of the urban environment.

AB Accurate prediction of crop yield is essential for agricultural trading, market risk management and food security. Although various statistical models and machine learning models have been developed to enhance prediction accuracy, spatial and temporal non-stationarity, an intrinsic attribute of many geographical processes, is still rarely considered in crop yield modeling. From a statistical point of view, this study respectively provided evidence for the existence of spatial non-stationarity and temporal non-stationarity in winter wheat yield prediction based on geographically weighted regression (GWR) and temporally weighted regression (TWR). Then, a geographically and temporally weighted neural network (GTWNN) model was proposed by integrating artificial neural network (ANN) into geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) using publicly available data sources, including satellite imagery and climate data. For a more credible evaluation, the leave-one-year-out strategy was adopted to make out-of-sample prediction resulting in a total of 12 test years from 2008 to 2019. The experiment results showed that the proposed GTWNN outperformed ANN, GTWR and support vector regression (SVR) achieving the average coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.766, 0.759 and 0.720 at the three prediction times of end of July, end of June and end of May. Moreover, an extended Moran's I was adopted to assess the degree of spatiotemporal autocorrelation of the prediction errors. The error aggregation of GTWNN was lower than other models, indicating that GTWNN is applicable to addressing spatial non-stationarity in modeling the relationship between predictors and yield response. The methodology proposed in this paper can be extended to handle spatiotemporal non-stationarity in other crop yield predictions and even other environmental phenomena.

AB Thermal remote sensing has been used in assessing oil spills in the ocean, mostly based on empirical interpretations. This study designs a ground-based experiment to measure brightness temperatures (BTs) of oil-inwater (OW) emulsions with different concentrations and oil-free water as a function of time in 32 consecutive hours. Compared with a previous thermal experiment to measure oil slicks (i.e., non-emulsified oil) with different thicknesses and considering the similarity between oil slicks and water-in-oil (WO) emulsions, it is found that (1) the diurnal response of brightness temperature difference (BTD, between oil samples and oil-free sample) to oil emulsion types (OW or WO) is similar, making it difficult to classify oil emulsion types using thermal remote sensing; (2) in contrast, BTD under thermal balance during the optimal time window appears to be a function of equivalent oil thickness (EOT) (oil volume per area, mm) regardless of oil emulsion type, suggesting that EOT could be estimated from BTD. Application of such experimental results to Landsat imagery over the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico suggests that although their ability to quantify oil footprint is limited, thermal data show potentials in providing unique information (e.g., estimating EOTs for up to 4 mm without the need of differentiating sub-pixel heterogeneity) to complement optical data in characterizing oil type and oil quantity when the spilled oil is thick (> 0.4 mm).

TI Tracking small-scale tropical forest disturbances: Fusing the Landsat
   and Sentinel-2 data record

AB Information on forest disturbance is crucial for tropical forest management and global carbon cycle analysis. The long-term collection of data from the Landsat missions provides some of the most valuable information for understanding the processes of global tropical forest disturbance. However, there are substantial uncertainties in the estimation of non-mechanized, small-scale (i.e., small area) clearings in tropical forests with Landsat series images. Because the appearance of small-scale openings in a tropical tree canopy are often ephemeral due to fastgrowing vegetation, and because clouds are frequent in tropical regions, it is challenging for Landsat images to capture the logging signal. Moreover, the spatial resolution of Landsat images is typically too coarse to represent spatial details about small-scale clearings. In this paper, by fusing all available Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, we proposed a method to improve the tracking of small-scale tropical forest disturbance history with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. First, yearly composited Landsat and Sentinel-2 self-referenced normalized burn ratio (rNBR) vegetation index images were calculated from all available Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2 scenes during 2016-2019. Second, a deep-learning based downscaling method was used to predict fine resolution (10 m) rNBR images from the annual coarse resolution (30 m) Landsat rNBR images. Third, given the baseline Landsat forest map in 2015, the generated fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images were fused to produce the 10 m forest disturbance map for the period 2016-2019. From data comparison and evaluation, it was demonstrated that the deep-learning based downscaling method can produce fineresolution Landsat rNBR images and forest disturbance maps that contain substantial spatial detail. In addition, by fusing downscaled fine-resolution Landsat rNBR images and original Sentinel-2 rNBR images, it was possible to produce state-of-the-art forest disturbance maps with OA values more than 87% and 96% for the small and large study areas, and detected 11% to 21% more disturbed areas than either the Sentinel-2 or Landsat-7/8 time-series alone. We found that 1.42% of the disturbed areas indentified during 2016-2019 experienced multiple forest disturbances. The method has great potential to enhance work undertaken in relation to major policies such as the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) programmes.

AB Although the statistical significances for the trends of integrated water vapor (IWV) are essential for a correct interpretation of climate change signals, obtaining accurate IWV trend estimates with realistic uncertainties remains a challenge. This study evaluates the feasibility of the IWV trends derived from the newly released fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) for climate change analysis in continental Europe. This is achieved by comparing the trends derived from in-situ ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS)'s daily IWV series from 1994 to 2019 at 109 stations. The realistic uncertainties and statistical significances of the IWV trends are evaluated with the time series analysis on their noise characteristics and proper noise models. Results show that autoregressive moving average ARMA(1,1) noise model is preferred rather than the commonly assumed white noise (WN) or first-order autoregressive AR(1) noise for about 68% of the ERA5 and GPS IWV series. An improper noise model would misevaluate the trend uncertainty of an IWV time series, compared with its specific preferred noise model. For example, ARMA(1,1) may misevaluate the standard deviations of their trend estimates (0.1-0.3 kg m(-2) decade(-1)) by 10%. Nevertheless, ARMA(1,1) is recommended as the default noise model for the ERA5 and GPS IWV series. However, the preferred noise model for each ERA5 minus GPS (E-G) IWV series should be specifically determined, because the AR(1)-related models can result in an underestimation on its trend uncertainty by 90%. In contrast, power-law (PL) model can lead to an overestimation by up to nine times. The E-G IWV trends are within -0.2-0.4 kg m(-2) decade(-1), indicating that the ERA5 is a potential data source of IWV trends for climate change analysis in continental Europe. The ERA5 and GPS IWV trends are consistent in their magnitudes and geographical patterns, lower in Northwest Europe (0-0.4 kg m(-2) decade(-1)) but higher around the Mediterranean Sea (0.6-1.4 kg m(-2) decade(-1)).

AB Longer time high-resolution, high-frequency, consistent, and more detailed land cover data are urgently needed in order to achieve sustainable development goals on food security, high-quality habitat construction, biodiversity conservation and planetary health, and for the understanding, simulation and management of the Earth system. However, due to technological constraints, it is difficult to provide simultaneously high spatial resolution, high temporal frequency, and high quality observation data. Existing mapping solutions are limited by traditional remotely sensed data, that have shorter observation periods, poor spatio-temporal consistency and comparability. Therefore, a new mapping paradigm is needed. This paper develops a framework for intelligent mapping (iMap) of land cover based on state-of-the-art technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, virtual constellations, and spatio-temporal reconstruction and fusion. Under this framework, we built an automated, serverless, end-to-end data production chain and parallel mapping system based on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and produced the first 30 m global daily seamless data cubes (SDC), and annual to seasonal land cover maps for 1985?2020. The SDC was produced through a multi-source spatio-temporal data reconstruction and fusion workflow based on Landsat, MODIS, and AVHRR virtual constellations. Independent validation results show that the relative mean error of the SDC is less than 2.14%. As analysis ready data (ARD), it can lay a foundation for high-precision quantitative remote sensing information extraction. From this SDC, we produced 36-year long, 30 m resolution global land cover map data set by combining strategies of sample migration, machine learning, and spatio-temporal adjustment. The average overall accuracy of our annual land cover maps over multiple periods of time is 80% for level 1 classification and over 73% for level 2 classification (29 and 33 classes). Based on an objective validation sample consisting of FLUXNET sites, our map accuracy is 10% higher than that of existing global land cover datasets including Globeland30. Our results show that the average global land cover change rate is 0.36%/yr. Global forest decreased by 1.47 million km2 from 38.44 million km2, cropland increased by 0.84 million km2 from 12.49 million km2 and impervious surface increased by 0.48 million km2 from 0.57 million km2 during 1985? 2020.

AB Compared with the limited capability of ground-level monitoring, remote sensing provides useful image data at a moderate or high spatial or temporal resolution with global coverage for monitoring of air pollutants, e.g., aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the MODIS for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical columns for ground-level NO2 concentration. However, the extensive nonrandom missingness of OMI-NO2 data (e.g., an approximate per-pixel missing proportion of 59% for mainland China in 2015) due to cloud contamination or high reflectance limits applicability of these data in estimation of ground-level NO2. This paper proposes the use of a full residual deep learning method to impute missing satellite-borne NO2 data (OMI-NO2) and to estimate (map) ground-level NO2 with uncertainty (coefficient of variation) at a high spatial (1 x 1 km(2)) and temporal (daily) resolution. For the large study region (mainland China except Hainan Province), the presented method achieved robust performance with a stable learning efficiency (mean test R-2: 0.98 with a small standard deviation of 0.01; mean test RMSE: 0.42 x 10(15) molecules/cm(2)) for imputation of OMI-NO2. In the model, the coordinates and elevation were used to capture the spatial variability of the OMI-NO2 columns, and fused meteorological grid data and planetary boundary layer height and ozone data from GEOS-FP were used to capture spatiotemporal variability of OMI-NO2. The evaluation with ground in situ NO2 measurements showed considerable contribution of the complete (raw observed and imputed) OMI-NO2 columns, meteorology and traffic variables to inference of ground-level NO2 (test R-2: 0.82; test RMSE: 8.80 mu g/m(3)). The complete grids of OMI-NO2 columns showed natural and smooth spatial transitions between the raw observed and imputed values. The surfaces of predicted NO2 concentration not only showed consistent distributions with OMI-NO2 at a regional and temporal scale, but also presented local spatial gradients of ground-level NO2. OMI-NO2 can be downscaled and imputed to be used as an important predictor to improve the estimation of high-resolution ground-level NO2. The reliable estimates of ground-level NO2 concentration with uncertainty can reduce the bias in estimates of NO2 exposure and subsequently evaluations of its health effects.

AB Fusing high-level passive microwave (PMW) LST and thermal infrared (TIR) LST products is a promising means of generating high-quality, all-weather land surface temperature (LST) data. In this paper, we propose a new fusion strategy for generating high-quality, all-weather LST data based on cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching and multiresolution Kalman filtering (MKF). CDF matching was employed to improve the quality of the high-resolution (0.01 degrees) LST data downscaled with the retrieved coarse-resolution (0.1 degrees) PMW LST from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperature (BT) data set. The MKF approach was employed to produce high-quality, all-weather LST data by fusing the retrieved coarse-resolution AMSR2 LST and high-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data sets filled with CDFimproved LST data. The spatial patterns in the high-resolution and coarse-resolution LST data were consistent after MKF fusion. The accuracy of coarse-resolution LST data was considerably improved. The biases, root mean square errors (RMSEs) and determination coefficients (R-2) were 0.79-1.47 K, 3.0-3.82 K, 0.88-0.96, respectively. The RMSE of the fused coarse-resolution LST data decreased by 1.51 K/1.82 K and 1.81 K/1.39 K in daytime/nighttime in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Heihe River Basin (HRB) verification regions compared to the RMSE of the retrieved AMSR2 LST data. The accuracy of high-resolution LST data remained unchanged, but the spatial coverage was complete with exceptions at the orbital gaps. The bias, RMSE and R-2 values of high-resolution LST data were - 0.91- -0.81 K, 3.02-3.32 K, and 0.93-0.97 under all-sky conditions in the TP and HRB verification regions, respectively. Compared to methods in the existing LST fusion studies, the proposed strategy has advantages in terms of LST data quality and validation accuracy. When both coarse-resolution and high-resolution LST data are missing, the spatial coverages of fused all-weather LST data are incomplete. We attempted to fill the vacancies in PMW LST data with the DINEOF method in advance and subsequently obtained spatially complete all-weather LST data.

AB The coupling of radiative transfer, energy balance, and photosynthesis models has brought new opportunities to characterize vegetation functional properties from space. However, these models do not accurately represent processes in ecosystems characterized by mixtures of green vegetation and senescent plant material (SPM), in particular grasslands. These inaccuracies limit the retrieval of vegetation biophysical and functional properties. Green and senesced plants feature contrasting spectral properties and carry out different functions that current coupled models do not represent separately. Besides, senescent pigments' absorption features change as SPM decomposes, and neither is this process well parameterized in radiative transfer models. This manuscript aims at overcoming these limitations. On the one hand, we have developed senSCOPE, a version of the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) that separately represents light interaction and physiology of green and senesced leaves. On the other, we have characterized new specific absorption coefficients of senescent pigments (K-s) from optical measurements of SPM from a Mediterranean grassland. Sensitivity analyses revealed that compared to SCOPE, senSCOPE 1) predicts variables that respond more linearly to the faction of green leaf area; and 2) keeps high levels of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation in the green leaves, which leads to significant differences in leaf photosynthesis, non-photochemical quenching, and transpiration. Moreover, we compared SCOPE vs. senSCOPE's capability to provide estimates of functional and biophysical parameters of vegetation. We assimilated different combinations of reflectance factors (R), chlorophyll sun-induced fluorescence radiance in the O-2-A band (F-760), gross primary production (GPP), and thermal radiance (L-t) measured in a Mediterranean grassland. Besides, we compared the role of three different sets of K-s coefficients in the inversion of senSCOPE, two estimated from SPM. The performance of the inversions was assessed using field data and a pattern-oriented model evaluation approach. Unlike SCOPE, senSCOPE provided unbiased estimates of chlorophyll content (C-ab) during the dry season. The use of SPM-specific K-s improved the representation of R in the near-infrared wavelengths; and, consequently, the estimation of leaf area index (LAI). Compared with field LAI, the coefficient of determination R-2 increased from similar to 0.4 to similar to 0.6, depending on the inversion constraints. Compared with SCOPE, the new model and coefficients together reduced the root mean squared error between observed and modeled R (similar to 40%), F-760 (similar to 30%), and GPP (similar to 5%). Both models failed to represent L-t; in this case, senSCOPE featured larger uncertainties. The modeling approach we propose improves the simulation and retrieval of vegetation properties and function in grasslands. Further work is needed to test the applicability of senSCOPE in different ecosystems, improve the simulation of the thermal spectral domain, and better characterize the optical parameters of SPM. To do so, new databases of SPM optical and biophysical properties should be produced.

AB The National Land Cover Database (NLCD) is an operational land cover monitoring program providing updated land cover and related information for the United States at five-year intervals. NLCD2016 extends temporal coverage to 15 years (2001-2016). We collected land cover reference data for the 2011 and 2016 nominal dates to report land cover accuracy for the NLCD2016 database 2011 and 2016 land cover components at Level II and Level I and for Level I 2011-2016 land cover change using two definitions of agreement. For both the 2011 and 2016 land cover components, single-date Level II overall accuracies (OA) were 72% (standard error of +/- 0.9%) when agreement was defined as match between the map label and primary reference label only and 86% (+/- 0.7%) when agreement also included the alternate reference label. The corresponding level I OA for both dates were 79% (+/- 0.9%) and 91% (+/- 1.0%). The 2011-2016 user's and producer's accuracies (UA and PA) were similar to 75% for forest loss and PA for water loss, grassland loss, and grass gain were > 70% when agreement included a match between the map label and either the primary or alternate reference label. Depending on agreement definition and level of the classification hierarchy, OA for the 2011 land cover component of the NLCD2016 database was about 4% to 7% higher than OA for the 2011 land cover component of the NLCD2011 database, suggesting that the changes in mapping methodologies initiated for production of the NLCD2016 database have led to improved product quality. Additionally, we used the reference dataset collected for assessment of the NLCD2011 database to assess the 2001 and 2006 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database. OA for the 2001 and 2006 land cover components was 1% - 5% lower than OA for the 2011 and 2016 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database. Higher OA for 2011 and 2016 land cover components of the NLCD2016 database relative to OA for its 2001 and 2006 components may be attributable to differences in reference data quality.

AB PM10 remote sensing is of great significance in the atmospheric environment studies. Contrary to intuitive perception, deriving PM10 is more difficult than PM2.5 from satellite measurements. This is because although the major satellite parameter Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) contain contribution of all suspended particles, it is much more sensitive to fine particles than coarse particles. To address this challenge, a physically based remote sensing method for PM10 is developed using two new semi-empirical physical models: the model of columnar volume-to extinction ratio (VE10) and the model of particle effective density. VE10 is a key parameter bridging the nonlinear relationship between aerosol extinction and volume concentration. A semi-empirical VE10 model is developed based on the fine mode fraction (FMF), and the mean relative error of VE10 modeling is 14.5%. Similarly, the particle effective density depends on the ratio of mass to volume. The particle effective density is effectively characterized by refractive index of matter, with the theoretical error of 13.8%. Both semi-empirical physical models are applied to the derivation of PM10, by using aerosol retrieval products of POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) produced by the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm. As a validation, PM10 mass concentration is estimated over China from Jan. to Oct. in 2013. A fairly good correlation and consistency are achieved by inter-comparison with in-situ PM10 measurements.

AB Characterization of aerosol vertical distribution in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) using passive remote sensing requires advances in the current state of the art. To quantify the performance of various passive sensor designs within a common framework we developed an aerosol climatology of the Los Angeles basin and applied observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) to estimate the information content retrievable from a variety of sensors measuring reflected near-infrared solar radiation. In addition to simulating current and planned satellite sensors, we also characterize the sensitivity of the California Laboratory for Atmospheric Remote Sensing - Fourier Transform Spectrometer (CLARS-FTS), located at Mt. Wilson (1.67 km above sea level), which is utilized in this work as a testbed for aerosol profiling remote sensing. We estimate the impacts of spectral coverage, radiance and polarization, spectral resolution, signal to noise ratio (SNR), and number of viewing angles on the information content and retrieval uncertainties of aerosol profiles in the PBL. We found that by adding high spectral resolution (full-width half-maximum of 3 cm(-1) or better), polarimetric measurements with a SNR of at least 212 to radiance measurements with SNR of 300 for both O-2 A and (1)Delta bands, the degrees of freedom for signal (DOFS) of a single CLARS-FTS measurement is raised from 2.1 to 2.8. This improvement is sufficient to simultaneously quantify three key parameters: aerosol optical depth, aerosol peak height, and aerosol layer thickness in the PBL. Current satellite-borne instruments (OCO-2, OCO-3, TEMPO, TROPOMI, and EPIC) and planned instruments (TEMPO, MicroCarb, SPEXone, and MAIA), individually provide a DOFS <= 2.25, which is insufficient to simultaneously quantify all three aerosol profiling parameters in the PBL. Joint radiometric and polarimetric measurements of the O-2 A and B bands with 3 cm(-1) spectral resolution, SNR of 500 for radiance and 353 for polarization, acquired at three viewing angles, can provide sufficient sensitivity to retrieve the three aerosol parameters simultaneously. The inclusion of high spectral resolution radiometric and polarimetric measurements reduces the required number of viewing angles, which is advantageous when the multiangular data are acquired with a pointable instrument. In this case a larger number of viewing angles reduces the spatial coverage that can be achieved for a given target.

AB Leaf optical spectra reflect the combination of leaf biochemical, morphological and physiological properties, and play an important role in many ecological and Earth system processes. Radiative transfer models are widely used to simulate leaf spectra by quantifying photon transfer processes of reflection, transmission and absorption within a plant leaf. Recent advances in spectral invariants theory offer a unique and efficient approach for modeling the canopy-scale radiative transfer processes, but remain underexplored for applications at the leaf scale. In this study, we developed a leaf-scale optical property model based on the spectrally invariant properties (leaf-SIP) of plant leaves. Similar to the canopy-scale model, the leaf-SIP model decouples leaf-scale radiative transfer process into two parts: wavelength-dependent contribution from leaf chemical components and wavelength-independent contribution from leaf structures, described by two spectrally invariant parameters (i.e., a photon recollision probability p and a scattering asymmetry parameter q). We implemented the leaf-SIP model by parameterizing p and q with a measurable leaf morphological trait, the leaf mass per area (LMA). We evaluated the performance of the leaf-SIP model with two in situ datasets (i.e., LOPEX and ANGERS) and the widely used PROSPECT leaf optical model. The results show that the leaf spectra simulated by the leaf-SIP model agreed well with in situ datasets and the simulations of the PROSPECT model, with a small root mean squared error (RMSE), bias, and high coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.026, 0.035, 0.95 and 0.037, 0.049, 0.91 for leaf reflectance and leaf transmittance, respectively. Our results also show that the leaf-SIP model can be used with measured leaf spectra to accurately estimate several key leaf functional traits, such as the leaf chlorophyll content, equivalent water thickness, and LMA. The leaf-SIP model provides an efficient and physical way of accurately simulating leaf spectra and retrieving key leaf functional traits from hyperspectral measurements.

AB Extraction of drainage networks is an important element of river flow routing in hydrology and large-scale estimates of river behaviors in Earth sciences. Emerging studies with a focus on greenhouse gases reveal that small rivers can contribute to more than half of the global carbon emissions from inland waters (including lakes and wetlands). However, large-scale extraction of drainage networks is constrained by the coarse resolution of observational data and models, which hinders assessments of terrestrial hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. Recognizing that Sentinel-2 satellite can detect surface water up to a 10-m resolution over large scales, we propose a new method named Remote Sensing Stream Burning (RSSB) to integrate high-resolution observational flow location with coarse topography to improve the extraction of drainage network. In RSSB, satellite-derived input is integrated in a spatially continuous manner, producing a quasi-bathymetry map where relative relief is enforced, enabling a fine-grained, accurate, and multitemporal extraction of drainage network. RSSB was applied to the Lancang-Mekong River basin to derive a 10-m resolution drainage network, with a significant reduction in location errors as validated by the river centerline measurements. The high-resolution extraction resulted in a realistic representation of meanders and detailed network connections. Further, RSSB enabled a multitemporal extraction of river networks during wet/dry seasons and before/after the formation of new channels. The proposed method is fully automated, meaning that the network extraction preserves basin-wide connectivity without requiring any postprocessing, hence facilitating the construction of drainage networks data with openly accessible imagery. The RSSB method provides a basis for the accurate representation of drainage networks that maintains channel connectivity, allows a more realistic inclusion of small rivers and streams, and enables a greater understanding of complex but active exchange between inland water and other related Earth system components.

AB Tidal flats are threatened by tidal reclamation and climatic changes around the world. Particular challenges exist in China where tidal flats are changing rapidly along with accelerated economic development in coastal regions. The unique and important ecosystem functions and services that tidal flats provide in coastal regions warrant the necessary of mapping such a particular land cover type in high precision and accuracy. Existing national tidal flat maps of China, which were derived from the 30-m resolution Landsat imagery and auxiliary data, are insufficient to support practical management efforts. In this study, in order to produce an accurate tidal flat map with finer spatial resolution, we employed 28,367 scenes of time series Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2019 and 2020 along the entire coastal line of China. The short revisit cycle (2-5 days) of the Sentinel-2 improved the opportunities of obtaining the highest and lowest tide images, and the finer spatial resolution (10-m) enhanced the capacity of precision tidal flat extraction. A rapid, robust, and automated tidal flat mapping approach is essential to large-scale applications. In this study, we developed an approach by integrating the maximum spectral index composite (MSIC) and the Otsu algorithm (OA), and so named MSIC-OA. By GEE platform, we automated the execution of MSIC-OA to Sentinel-2 images, and produced an up-to-date 10-m spatial resolution tidal flat map of China (China_Tidal Flat, CTF). Validated by massive field-based observations and selected edge-points, the CTF map achieved an overall accuracy of 95% and the F1 score of 0.93. As we calculated, the total area of tidal flats in China was 858,784 ha, and Jiangsu Province accounted the largest proportion (24%) of the national total. This study is the first attempt to delineate tidal flats automatically at a 10-m spatial resolution. The CTF map can provide essential information for management of coastal ecosystems and facilitate the implementations of coastal and marine related Sustainable Development Goals.

AB The Great Salt Lake (GSL) in Utah has been shrinking since the middle of the 19th Century, leading to decreased area and volume, and increased salinity. We use satellite data products from the Terra and Aqua MODerateresolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat-7 and-8 satellites, along with meteorological and streamflow data, and modeled data products to study the relationship between changing snow-cover conditions and the decline of the GSL since 2000 in the context of the historical record of lake levels. The GSL basin includes much of the snow-dominated Wasatch and Uinta mountain ranges to the east of the lake. Snowmelt feeds the Bear, Jordan, and Weber rivers which are the three main rivers that flow into the lake. Snowmelttiming maps, derived from a new MODIS standard snow-cover product, MOD10A1F, show that snow melted-9.5 days earlier in the GSL basin during the study period, extending from 2000 to 2018. Air temperatures derived from 26 meteorological stations and surface temperatures measured by the Aqua MODIS land-surface temperature (LST) products, MYD21A1D and MYD21A1N, show trends of increasing temperature of similar to 0.94 degrees C (alpha = 0.05), and similar to 2.18 degrees C, respectively, with most of the LST trends in the GSL basin being statistically significant (alpha = 0.05). Increasing air temperatures in the basin have led to less precipitation falling as snow, lower snow depth (by-34.5 mm (alpha = 0.01)) and snow-water equivalent (0.02 mm (alpha = 0.01)), and earlier snowmelt. Also during the study period, Global Land surface Evaporation Amsterdam Model data show evaporation increasing by similar to 3.2 mm/yr, with trends in much of the basin being statistically significant (alpha = 0.05). Trends calculated from the various products are generally in agreement indicating higher temperatures, greater evaporation, less snowfall and snow-on-the ground, and earlier snowmelt. Earlier snowmelt contributes to increasing evaporative loss from water flowing toward the lake. Furthermore, a lower mountain snowpack and less precipitation falling as snow (versus rain) is associated with lower stream discharge even if overall precipitation stays the same. The surface-water temperature of the GSL also increased over the study period by similar to 0.69 degrees C, according to the MODIS LST data products, the surface-water elevation of the lake dropped by similar to 1.7 m between 2000 and 2018, and the areal extent of the lake decreased by similar to 901 km(2) as measured using Landsat imagery. Desiccation of the lake is associated with deleterious effects on wildlife, recreational activities, and some local industries. And, importantly, an expanding lake bed can also fuel dust storms that promote dangerous air quality along the Wasatch Front. This work elucidates the key role that satellite remote sensing can play in documenting earlier snowmelt and other changes in the GSL basin that influence the ongoing decline of the Great Salt Lake.

AB Leaf biochemical and structural traits are vegetation characteristics related to various physiological processes. Taking advantage of the physical relationship between optical properties and leaf biochemistry, field-based spectroscopy has allowed for the rapid estimation of leaf biochemical constituents and repeated nondestructive measurements through time. Leaf constituent retrieval from leaf optical properties following inversion of the physically-based radiative transfer model PROSPECT is now a popular method, but some cases prompt poor retrieval success and this approach requires a strict inversion procedure. We investigated the performances of different inversion procedures for the estimation of leaf constituents, specifically chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, water (EWT), and dry matter (LMA) from >1400 broadleaf samples, including the definition of optimal spectral subdomains, and the use of leaf reflectance or transmittance alone. We also developed a strategy to obtain prior information on the leaf structure parameter (N) in PROSPECT, when only reflectance or transmittance is measured, and examined the influence of this prior information in combination with different inversion procedures. We found that using the full domain of reflectance or transmittance only systematically leads to suboptimal estimation of chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids, EWT, and LMA, due to either the combined absorption of multiple constituents or inaccurate estimation of the N parameter. Our study confirms that the selection of optimal spectral subdomains leads to improved estimation of all leaf constituents, from 700 to 720 nm for chlorophyll a and b, 520-560 nm for carotenoids, and from 1700 to 2400 nm for EWT and LMA. Prior information on N, computed directly from the spectra, leads to systematic improved estimation of leaf constituents when only reflectance or transmittance is measured, with reductions in normalized root mean square error from 8 to 37%. We strongly recommend using optimal subdomains when inverting PROSPECT to retrieve leaf constituents, and with the availability of only reflectance or transmittance we further recommend the use of prior information on the N parameter.

AB Climate change is amplified in the Arctic region (north of 60 degrees N) relative to elsewhere. By analyzing climate model simulations, it has been found that the largest factor in Arctic Amplification comes from enhanced temperature feedbacks, caused by the different vertical atmospheric warming profiles and a larger temperature change for longwave emission per unit of warming at highcompared to low-latitudes. Radiometers on polar-orbiting satellites offer the best mechanism to derive sea surface temperature (SST) in the Arctic, but given that the retrieval algorithms in the infrared (IR) are designed to compensate for the effects of the atmosphere, mainly water vapor (WV), IR satellite-derived SSTs have larger inaccuracies at high latitudes because the atmosphere can be very dry and cold. So, the motivation of this study is to improve the algorithms to obtain more accurate SSTs which can be used to research the feedback mechanisms. To undertake the study, the 5-year matchup database (MUDB) for MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on Aqua has been analyzed to characterize the differences between collocated and simultaneous satellite retrieved skin SSTs (SSTskin) using the R2014 dataset and in situ buoy temperatures, and to identify the main causes of the discrepancies. According to the radiative transfer simulations, the sea surface emissivity is proven to be significant in satellite SSTskin retrievals at high latitudes due to the low atmospheric WV content, especially during winter. An Emissivity-introduced Brightness Temperature Difference (EBT) is developed to correct this emissivity effect in the algorithm. Furthermore, the reference temperature as a weighting factor for differences in brightness temperature (BT) measured in MODIS bands 31 and 32 has also been adjusted. The satellite SSTskin mean bias and standard deviation are reduced by 0.35 K and 0.085 K after the corrections. The approaches presented in this paper are capable to make more appropriate atmospheric corrections for MODIS SSTskin retrieval algorithm, leading to regional optimization of the SST retrievals. We report on the progress towards improving the satellite-derived SSTskin with the expectation that the near two-decadal time series of MODIS SSTskin fields will contribute to studying climate change in the Arctic.

AB Monitoring invasive species distribution and prevalence is important, but direct field-based assessment is often impractical. In this paper, we introduce and validate a cost-effective method for mapping understory invasive plant species. We utilized Landsat imagery, spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and a maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling framework to map the spatial extent of Mikania micrantha in Chitwan National Park, Nepal and community forests within its buffer zone. We developed a spectral library from reference and image sources and applied multiple endmember SMA (MESMA) to selected Landsat imagery. Incorporating the resultant green vegetation and shade fractions into Maxent, we mapped the distribution of understory M. micrantha in the study area, with training and testing Area under Curve (AUC) values around 0.80, and kappa around 0.55. In vegetated places, especially mature forests, an increase in green vegetation fraction and decrease in shade fraction was associated with higher likelihood of M. micrantha presence. In addition, the inclusion of elevation as a model input further improved map accuracy (AUC around 0.95; kappa around 0.80). Elevation, a surrogate for distance to water in this case, proved to be the determining factor of M. micrantha's distribution in the study area. The combination of MESMA and Maxent can provide significant opportunities for understanding understory vege-tation distribution, and contribute to ecological restoration, biodiversity conservation, and provision of sustainable ecosystem services in protected areas.

AB Biochemical traits in forest vegetation are key indicators of leaf physiological processes, specifically photo-synthetic and other photochemical light pathways, and are critical to the quantification of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Advances in remote sensing sensors and platforms are allowing multi-dimensional and continuous-spatial information to be acquired in a fast and non-destructive way to quantify forest biochemical traits at multiple spatial scales. Here we demonstrate the use of high spectral resolution, hyperspectral data combined with high density three-dimensional information from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) both acquired from an unmanned aerial system (UAS) platform, to quantify and assess the three-dimensional distribution of biochemical pigments on individual tree canopy surfaces. To do so, a DSM based fusion method was developed to integrate the 3D LiDAR point cloud with hyperspectral reflectance data. Regression-based models were then developed to predict a number of biochemical traits (i.e., chlorophyll (Chl) a, b, total Chl and total carotenoids (Cars) content) from a suite of common spectral indices at three vertical canopy levels, and were evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. One-way ANOVA and Duncan's multiple comparison post hoc tests were used to investigate the vertical distribution of biochemical pigments on individual tree canopy surfaces, and in response to age and species. Our results demonstrated that a number of vegetation indices, derived from the hyperspectral data, were strongly correlated with a number of biochemical traits (Adj-R-2 = 0.85-0.91; rRMSE = 5.19-6.38%). In general, models fitted using leaf samples from the upper, middle and lower canopies separately (AdjR(2) = 0.85-0.91; rRMSE = 5.19-6.38%) had similar accuracy to the models developed with pooled data (AdjR(2) = 0.87-0.90; rRMSE = 5.21-6.11%). The differences between separate models and global models were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). However, the distribution of biochemical pigments across vertical layers varied significantly. For dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) and poplar (Populus deltoides), the results were consistent in that the lower component of the canopy (least light impacted) had the highest chlorophyll and carotenoids biochemical traits. Moreover, the vertical distribution of biochemical traits on individual tree canopy surfaces changed with age likely due to the growth variation from the photosynthetic activity of the canopy. This study indicates the potential of using fused 3D point cloud information with spectral data to monitor physiological activities of forest canopy for carbon accumulation estimation as well as precision forestry applications such as nutrition diagnosis, water regulation and subsequent productivity enhancement of these planted forest systems.

TI Bay of Bengal Sea surface salinity variability using a decade of
   improved SMOS re-processing

AB Monsoon rain and rivers bring large freshwater input to the Northern Bay of Bengal (BoB), yielding low Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) after the monsoon. The resulting sharp upper-ocean salinity stratification is thought to influence tropical cyclones intensity and biological productivity by inhibiting vertical mixing. Despite recent progresses, the density of in situ data is far from sufficient to monitor the BoB SSS variability, even at the seasonal timescale. The advent of satellite remotely-sensed SSS (SMOS, Aquarius, SMAP) offers a unique opportunity to provide synoptic maps of the BoB SSS every similar to 8 days. Previous SMOS SSS retrievals did not perform well in the BoB. Here, we show that improved systematic error corrections and quality control procedures yield a much better performance of the new "debiased v4" CATDS level-3 SSS from SMOS (similar to 0.8 correlation, 0.04 bias and 0.64 root-mean-square difference to more than 28,000 collocated in situ data points over 2010-2019). The SMOS product now performs equivalently to Aquarius, and is slightly inferior to SMAP over the BoB. In particular, SMAP and SMOS are able to capture salinity variations close to the east coast of India (r > 0.8 within 75-150 km of the coast). They thus capture the seasonal freshening there, associated with equatorward advection of the Northern BoB low-salinity water by the East Indian Coastal Current (EICC) after the summer monsoon. The 10-year long SMOS record further allows to describe the BoB interannual SSS variability, which is strongest in boreal fall in relation with the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Positive IOD events induce a weakening of the southward export of freshwater by the EICC, and hence negative SSS anomalies in the Northern BoB and positive ones along the East Indian coast. This confirms results from earlier studies based on modelling, sparse in situ data, or shorter satellite records, but this time from a 10-year long SSS record. Overall, our study indicates that the new SMOS retrieval can be confidently used to monitor the BoB SSS and to study its mechanisms. We end by a brief description of the BoB SSS anomalies associated with the extreme 2019 IOD event and highlight the very good performance over the BoB of a new multi-satellite product developed by the European Space Agency merging SMOS, Aquarius and SMAP data.

AB A hyperspectral inversion algorithm was used to distinguish between cyanobacteria and algal blooms in optically complex inland waters. A framework for the algorithm is presented that incorporates a bio-optical model, a solution for the radiative transfer equation using the EcoLight-S radiative transfer model, and a non-linear optimization procedure. The natural variability in the size of phytoplankton populations was simulated using a two-layered sphere model that generated size-specific inherent optical properties (IOPs). The algorithm effectively determined the type of high-biomass blooms in terms of the relative percentage species composition of cyanobacteria. It also provided statistically significant estimates of population size (as estimated by the effective diameter), chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and phycocyanin pigment concentrations, the phytoplankton absorption coefficient, and the non-algal absorption coefficient. The algorithm framework presented here can in principle be adapted for distinguishing between phytoplankton groups using satellite and in situ remotely sensed reflectance.

AB Historical wetland hydrology data are instrumental to support the design of wetland management and restoration strategies but are rarely available. In this study, we tested the capabilities and limitations of a simple methodological framework based on publicly available MODIS Land Reflectance Products to estimate wetland soil surface saturation and inundation spatiotemporal dynamics. Using supervised learning and high-resolution groundwater and surface water elevation data, the framework searches for spectral algorithms, referred to as the wet/dry wetland status classifier (WSC) and the continuous wetland dynamics identifier (WDI), that best predict upper soil layer wetness status in the study wetland. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) for fast access and processing of the full range of MODIS data. The capabilities of GEE also enabled us to readily conduct a comparative assessment of the MODIS 8-day composite and daily collections and test various pixel-level quality filters to select reliable data at the highest possible temporal resolution. We tested the framework on the internationally-recognized Ramsar site Palo Verde National Park wetland in Costa Rica, and we obtained good results (overall prediction accuracy of 86.6% and kappa coefficient of 0.7 for the WSC; r(2) of 0.71 for the WDI). High-resolution water level data allowed us to assess the challenges, promises and limitations of using MODIS products for wetland hydrology applications. We then applied the WSC and WDI to map the 2000-2016 sub-weekly wetland hydroperiod at 500m resolution, achieving a temporal resolution rarely matched in remote sensing for wetland studies. The analysis of the end-products, combined with the field water elevation data, provided new insights into the drivers controlling the spatiotemporal dynamics of hydroperiod within the Palo Verde wetland and did not reveal any significant temporal trends. The WSC and WDI framework developed here can be useful for reconstructing long-term hydroperiod variability and uncovering its drivers for other wetland systems globally.

AB Melt ponds on sea ice play an important role in the seasonal evolution of the summer ice cover. In this study we present two machine learning algorithms, one (multi-layer neural network) for the retrieval of melt pond binary classification and another (multinomial logistic regression) for melt pond fraction using moderate resolution visible satellite imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To minimize the impact of the anisotropic reflectance characteristics of sea ice and melt ponds, normalized MODIS band reflectance differences from top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) measured reflectances were used. The training samples for the machine learning were based on MODIS reflectances extracted for sea ice, melt ponds and open water classifications based on high resolution (similar to 2 m) WorldView (WV) data. The accuracy assessment for melt pond binary classification and fraction is further evaluated against WV imagery, showing mean overall accuracy (85.5%), average mean difference (0.09), and mean RMSE (0.18). In addition to cross-validation with WV, retrieved melt pond data are validated against melt pond fractions from satellite and ship-based observations, showing average mean differences (MD), root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and correlation coefficients (R) of 0.05, 0.12, and 0.41, respectively. We further investigate a case study of the spectral characteristics of melt ponds and ice during refreezing, and demonstrate an approach to mask out refrozen pixels by using yearly maps of melt onset and freeze-up data together with ice surface temperatures (IST). Finally, an example of monthly mean pan-Arctic melt pond binary classification and fraction are shown for July 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, and 2019. Bulk processing of the entire 20 years of MODIS data will provide the science community with a much needed pan-Arctic melt pond data set.

AB There is considerable demand for satellite observations that can support spatiotemporally continuous mapping of land surface temperature (LST) because of its strong relationships with many surface processes. However, the frequent occurrence of cloud cover induces a large blank area in current thermal infrared-based LST products. To effectively fill this blank area, a new method for reconstructing the cloud-covered LSTs of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daytime observations is described using random forest (RF) regression approach. The high temporal resolution of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) LST product assisted in identifying the temporal variations in cloud cover. The cumulative downward shortwave radiation flux (DSSF) was estimated as the solar radiation factor for each MODIS pixel based on the MSG DSSF product to represent the impact from cloud cover on incident solar radiation. The RF approach was used to fit an LST linking model based on the datasets collected from clear-sky pixels that depicted the complicated relationship between LST and the predictor variables, including the surface vegetation index (the normalized difference vegetation index and the enhanced vegetation index), normalized difference water index, solar radiation factor, surface albedo, surface elevation, surface slope, and latitude. The fitted model was then used to reconstruct the LSTs of cloud-covered pixels. The proposed method was applied to the Terra/MODIS daytime LST product for four days in 2015, spanning different seasons in southwestern Europe. A visual inspection indicated that the reconstructed LSTs thoroughly captured the distribution of surface temperature associated with surface vegetation cover, solar radiation, and topography. The reconstructed LSTs showed similar spatial pattern according to the comparison with clear-sky LSTs from temporally adjacent days. In addition, evaluations against Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) NOAH 0.25 degrees 3-h LST data and reference LST data derived based on in-situ air temperature measurements showed that the reconstructed LSTs presented a stable and reliable performance. The coefficients of determination derived with the GLDAS LST data were all above 0.59 on the four examined days. These results indicate that the proposed method has a strong potential for reconstructing LSTs under cloud-covered conditions and can also accurately depict the spatial patterns of LST.

AB Satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is emerging as a viable low-cost alternative method to airborne laser scanning (ALS) for forest inventory though little research has examined its efficacy for plantation forests located in temperate regions on steep terrain. InSAR and ALS data were collected from Geraldine Forest which is located on rolling to very steep topography in the southeast of New Zealand. These data were combined with an extensive set of plot measurements from which mean top height (H), basal area (G), stem density (N), and total stem volume (TSV) were calculated. InSAR and ALS-based Random Forest models of each variable were developed and compared.
   Using the ALS data as a reference, the mean RMSE of the InSAR DSM and DTM surfaces were, respectively, 4.58 and 8.09 m and these errors increased to mean values of, respectively, 6.02 and 10.17 m for slopes of 40-50 degrees.
   ALS-based models were substantially more precise than those developed from InSAR for H (R-2 = 0.86 vs. 0.60; RMSE% = 5.47 vs. 10.8%), G (R-2 = 0.56 vs. 0.32; RMSE% = 21.5 vs. 30.4%), N (R-2 = 0.47 vs. 0.09; RMSE% = 32.3 vs. 43.2%), and TSV (R-2 = 0.70 vs. 0.41; RMSE% = 19.4 vs. 30.7%). The base metrics (i.e. ALS height and canopy cover variables) accounted for most of the variance in the ALS models with addition of further metrics providing <= 1% reduction in the RMSE%. Base metrics (i.e. InSAR observables) also accounted for most of the variation in InSAR models. Addition of metrics from a mixed Canopy Height Model (CHM), derived from InSAR Digital Surface Model (DSM) and ALS Digital Terrain Model (DTM), resulted in reductions in RMSE% of 3.1-5.4% for H, G, and TSV models with addition of textural metrics providing further reductions of 0.2-0.3% for H and G models. Addition of metrics from the radar CHM, derived from the InSAR DTM and DSM, and texture metrics reduced the RMSE% of the base model for N by 2.3% and 0.5%, respectively.
   The results were generated using a SAR image pair with a height of ambiguity (HOA) that was higher than ideal, which reduced the sensitivity of results to changes in terrain. Despite this limitation, and the steep slopes throughout the forest, the InSAR models described here had comparable precision to developed InSAR models for key inventory metrics from previous studies.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) amplitude measurements from spaceborne sensors are sensitive to surface roughness conditions near their radar wavelength. These backscatter signals are often exploited to assess the roughness of plowed agricultural fields and water surfaces, and less so to complex, heterogeneous geological surfaces. The bedload of mixed sand- and gravel-bed rivers can be considered a mixture of smooth (compacted sand) and rough (gravel) surfaces. Here, we assess backscatter gradients over a large high-mountain alluvial river in the eastern Central Andes with aerially exposed sand and gravel bedload using X-band TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, C-band Sentinel-1, and L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 radar scenes. In a first step, we present theory and hypotheses regarding radar response to an alluvial channel bed. We test our hypotheses by comparing backscatter responses over vegetation-free endmember surfaces from inside and outside of the active channel-bed area. We then develop methods to extract smoothed backscatter gradients downstream along the channel using kernel density estimates. In a final step, the local variability of sand-dominated patches is analyzed using Fourier frequency analysis, by fitting stretched-exponential and power-law regression models to the 2-D power spectrum of backscatter amplitude. We find a large range in backscatter depending on the heterogeneity of contiguous smooth- and rough-patches of bedload material. The SAR amplitude signal responds primarily to the fraction of smooth-sand bedload, but is further modified by gravel elements. The sensitivity to gravel is more apparent in longer wavelength L-band radar, whereas C- and X-band is sensitive only to sand variability. Because the spatial extent of smooth sand patches in our study area is typically< 50 m, only higher resolution sensors (e.g., TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X) are useful for power spectrum analysis. Our results show the potential for mapping sand-gravel transitions and local geomorphic complexity in alluvial rivers with aerially exposed bedload using SAR amplitude.

AB Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) no. 15 addresses the protection of terrestrial ecosystems and sustainable forest management, and Target 15.2 encourages countries to sustainably manage forests, and halt deforestation by 2020. SDG indicator 15.1.1 proposes tracking forest area as an indicator for achieving that SDG. Though mangrove forests represent only about 5% of Belize's overall forest cover, the critical ecosystem services they provide are recognized in the country's Forests Act, which regulates the modification of mangrove ecosystems. Preceding the SDGs, from 2008 to 2009, the Government of Belize piloted a complete moratorium on mangrove removal, building on the Forests Act. As Earth Observation (EO) systems provide a means to track effectiveness of Belize's management of its mangrove forests, this paper examines historic and recent changes in mangrove cover across all of Belize, applying statistical adjustments to rates of change derived from Landsat satellite data. Particular attention was paid to the country's only World Heritage Site, the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System (BBRRS), where mangrove clearing was prohibited since the site's designation in December 1996. The data indicate that within the BBRRS, approximately 89 ha of mangroves were lost from 1996 to 2017, compared to the estimated loss of 2703 ha outside the BBRRS during the same period, and nationwide loss of almost 4100 ha from 1980 to 2017. Thus, compared to the mangroves outside of the BBRRS, the annual rate of mangrove loss within the BBRRS over the period 1996-2017 was merely 4.24 ha per year, versus 129.11 ha per year outside the BBRRS. Furthermore, almost 75% of the 1996-2017 mangrove loss outside the BBRRS were concentrated in three particular geographic zones associated with tourism infrastructure. It was also estimated that Belize's overall mangrove cover declined 5.4% over 36 years, from 76,250 ha in 1980 to 72,169 ha in 2017. In terms of its implications, in addition to contributing to SDG 15, this work also addresses SDG Target 14.2 regarding sustainable management of marine and coastal ecosystems. This study serves as a use case of how EO data can contribute to monitoring changes in baseline data and thus tracking of progress toward SDG Targets.

AB The first national product of Surface Water Dynamics in France (SWDF) is generated on a monthly temporal scale and 10-m spatial scale using an automatic rule-based superpixel (RBSP) approach. The current surface water dynamic products from high resolution (HR) multispectral satellite imagery are typically analyzed to determine the annual trend and related seasonal variability. Annual and seasonal time series analyses may fail to detect the infra-annual variations of water bodies. Sentinel-2 allows us to investigate water resources based on both spatial and temporal high-resolution analyses. We propose a new automatic RBSP approach on the Google Earth Engine platform. The RBSP method employs combined spectral indices and superpixel techniques to delineate the surface water extent; this approach avoids the need for training data and benefits large-scale, dynamic and automatic monitoring. We used the proposed RBSP method to process Sentinel-2 monthly composite images covering a two-year period and generate the monthly surface water extent at the national scale, i.e., over France. Annual occurrence maps were further obtained based on the pixel frequency in monthly water maps. The monthly dynamics provided in SWDF products are evaluated by HR satellite-derived water masks at the national scale (JRC GSW monthly water history) and at local scales (over two lakes, i.e., Lake Der-Chantecoq and Lake Orient, and 200 random sampling points). The monthly trends between SWDF and GSW were similar, with a coefficient of 0.94. The confusion matrix-based metrics based on the sample points were 0.885 (producer's accuracy), 0.963 (user's accuracy), 0.932 (overall accuracy) and 0.865 (Matthews correlation coefficient). The annual surface water extents (i.e., permanent and maximum) are validated by two HR satellite image-based water maps and an official database at the national scale and small water bodies (ponds) at the local scale at Loir-et-Cher. The results show that the SWDF results are closely correlated to the previous annual water extents, with a coefficient > 0.950. The SWDF results are further validated for large rivers and lakes, with extraction rates of 0.929 and 0.802, respectively. Also, SWDF exhibits superiority to GSW in small water body extraction (taking 2498 ponds in Loir-et-Cher as example), with an extraction rate improved by approximately 20%. Thus, the SWDF method can be used to study interannual, seasonal and monthly variations in surface water systems. The monthly dynamic maps of SWDF improved the degree of land surface coverage by 25% of France on average compared with GSW, which is the only product that provides monthly dynamics. Further harmonization of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 and the introduction of enhanced cloud detection algorithm can fill some gaps of no-data regions.

AB Commonly applied water indices such as the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were originally conceived for medium spatial resolution remote sensing images. In recent decades, high spatial resolution imagery has shown considerable potential for deriving accurate land cover maps of urban environments. Applying traditional water indices directly on this type of data, however, leads to severe misclassifications as there are many materials in urban areas that are confused with water. Furthermore, threshold parameters must generally be fine-tuned to obtain optimal results. In this paper, we propose a new open surface water detection method for urbanized areas. We suggest using inequality constraints as well as physical magnitude constraints to identify water from urban scenes. Our experimental results on spectral libraries and real high spatial resolution remote sensing images demonstrate that by using a set of suggested fixed threshold values, the proposed method outperforms or obtains comparable results with algorithms based on traditional water indices that need to be fine-tuned to obtain optimal results. When applied to the ASTER and ECOSTRESS spectral libraries, our method identified 3677 out of 3695 non-water spectra. By contrast, NDWI and MNDWI only identified 2934 and 2918 spectra. Results on three real hyperspectral images demonstrated that the proposed method successfully identified normal water bodies, meso-eutrophic water bodies, and most of the muddy water bodies in the scenes with F-measure values of 0.91, 0.94 and 0.82 for the three scenes. For surface glint and hyper-eutrophic water, our method was not as effective as could be expected. We observed that the commonly used threshold value of 0 for NDWI and MNDWI results in greater levels of confusion, with F-measures of 0.83, 0.64 and 0.64 (NDWI) and 0.77, 0.63 and 0.59 (MNDWI). The proposed method also achieves higher precision than the untuned NDWI and MNDWI with the same recall values. Next to numerical performance, the proposed method is also physically justified, easy-to implement, and computationally efficient, which suggests that it has potential to be applied in large scale water detection problem.

AB Consistent, cross-mission retrievals of near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) in various aquatic ecosystems with broad ranges of trophic levels have long been a complex undertaking. Here, we introduce a machine-learning model, the Mixture Density Network (MDN), that largely outperforms existing algorithms when applied across different bio-optical regimes in inland and coastal waters. The model is trained and validated using a sizeable database of co-located Chla measurements (n = 2943) and in situ hyperspectral radiometric data resampled to simulate the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and the Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-2A/B and Sentinel-3A/B, respectively. Our performance evaluations of the model, via two-thirds of the in situ dataset with Chla ranging from 0.2 to 1209 mg/m(3) and a mean Chla of 21.7 mg/m(3), suggest significant improvements in Chla retrievals. For both MSI and OLCI, the mean absolute logarithmic error (MAE) and logarithmic bias (Bias) across the entire range reduced by 40-60%, whereas the root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) and the median absolute percentage error (MAPE) improved two-to-three times over those from the state-of-the-art algorithms. Using independent Chla matchups (n < 800) for Sentinel-2A/B and -3A, we show that the MDN model provides most accurate products from recorded images processed via three different atmospheric correction processors, namely the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), POLYMER, and ACOLITE, though the model is found to be sensitive to uncertainties in remote-sensing reflectance products. This manuscript serves as a preliminary study on a machine-learning algorithm with potential utility in seamless construction of Chla data records in inland and coastal waters, i.e., harmonized, comparable products via a single algorithm for MSI and OLCI data processing. The model performance is anticipated to enhance by improving the global representativeness of the training data as well as simultaneous retrievals of multiple optically active components of the water column.

AB A framework for estimating aboveground forest carbon stock (AFCS) is required for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in Developing Countries. Recently, methods for estimating the spatial distribution of AFCS using remotely sensed datasets and multiple prediction techniques have been found to be useful, particularly given the prohibitive costs of acquiring the necessary sample sizes for sufficiently precise pure field-based estimation of this variable. The objective of the study was to assess and compare the capabilities of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, L-band radar data and UltraCam images in combination with four commonly used prediction techniques for estimating mean AFCS per unit area: multiple linear regression (MLR) and the nonparametric k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF) algorithms. Our study area was a part of Hyrcanian deciduous forests in two managed and unmanaged stands at Shast Kalateh forest. We used a systematic sample consisting of 308 circular field plots of 0.1 ha located at the intersections of a 150 x 200 m grid with a random starting point and remote sensing-derived metrics as auxiliary data. We used 67% of the sample plots for training purposes and the remaining 33% for validation. Also, we used the model-assisted estimators to statistically rigorously estimate mean AFCS per unit area and its standard error (SE).
   Among the remotely sensed datasets, considered singly, the ALS data with R-2* = 0.34, rRMSE = 47.42% and relative efficiency (RE) = 1.51 produced the greatest accuracy and precision for AFCS estimation. RE can be interpreted as the factor by which the sample size for the pure field-based estimator would have to be increased to obtain the same precision as for the model-assisted estimator using auxiliary data. Among the remotely sensed datasets considered in combination, the ALS and PALSAR dataset with R-2* = 0.41, rRMSE = 44.80% and RE = 1.70 produced the greatest prediction accuracy and precision and increased the proportion of variability explained relative to ALS and PALSAR separately by 7% and 36%, respectively. Contrary to our expectation, the combination of PALSAR and UltraCam data decreased the precision of AFCS estimates. All the remotely sensed datasets, singly and in combination, with the most accurate prediction techniques for each combination produced estimates of AFCS that were within the 95% confidence interval for the field-based estimate.

AB Climate observations indicate more frequent drought in recent years, and model predictions suggest that drought occurrence will continue to rise with global warming. Understanding drought impacts on ecosystem functioning requires accurate quantification of vegetation sensitivity to changes in water supply condition. This is complicated by the seasonal variation in plant structural and physiological response to water stress, especially for semi-arid grasslands with characteristic strong spatial and temporal variability in carbon uptake. Here, we use complementary satellite soil moisture (SM) and total water storage (TWS) observations to delineate plant-accessible water supply variations for natural grasslands in the Missouri basin, USA. We evaluate how water supply influences the spatiotemporal variations in grassland productivity as a function of seasonal timing and climate condition. We identify a 128-day period from mid-June to early October when grassland growth is sensitive to soil moisture changes. We find the strongest SM sensitivity after the peak of the growing season associated with high temperature and VPD. SM limitation can extend to early and late growing season under warm conditions, while grassland sensitivity to SM is generally stronger in the late growth stage than in the green-up period given similar temperature and soil moisture. We find that complementary to the surface SM observations, TWS provides plant-available water storage information from the deeper soil, and both SM and TWS exert a lagged impact on grassland productivity. We find that the lag between the inter-annual variation of SM and associated plant response increases through the season, and overall there is a transition from SM-limitation to TWS-limitation on productivity during the late growing period when the TWS level is near the seasonal low. Future global change projections should account for a seasonally varying vegetation-moisture relationship to accurately assess the impact of the water supply constraint on plant productivity in a warming climate.

AB Accurate remote assessment of phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration in turbid case-2 waters is a challenge, owing largely to terrestrial substances (such as minerals and humus) that are optically significant but do not co-vary with phytoplankton. Here, we propose an improved Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA) (denoted as TC2) for retrieving Chla concentrations from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) which can be applied to Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) images in turbid case-2 waters. TC2 has two main extensions when compared with QAA. First, TC2 makes an additional assumption to separate the total non-water absorption at 665 nm (a(nw)(665)) into phytoplankton absorption (a(ph)(665)) and yellow matter (a(ym)(665)), which is the sum of colored dissolved matter (CDOM) and detritus. Second, for selecting the position of the near-infrared (NIR) band which is used to estimate the signal of total backscattering coefficient (b(b)(lambda(0))) at QAA reference band (lambda(0)), we take into account the assumption that the absorption of pure water should be dominant at this band, as well as the impact of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the NIR band on the Chla concentration estimating model. When applied to in situ R-rs(lambda) and OLCI match-up R-rs(lambda) data in this study, TC2 provided more accurate Chla estimation than previous Cha concentration retrieval algorithms for turbid case-2 waters. TC2 has the potential for use as a simple and effective algorithm for monitoring Chla concentrations in the turbid case-2 waters at a global scale from space.

AB The natural world has multiple, sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic, values to society when viewed through the lens of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Spatial mapping of nature's contributions to the SDGs has the potential to support the implementation of SDG strategies through sustainable land management and conservation of ecosystem services. Such mapping requires a range of spatial data. This paper examines the use of remote sensing and spatial ecosystem service modelling to examine nature's contribution to targets under SDG 6, also highlighting synergies with other key SDGs and trade-offs with agriculture.
   We use a wide range of remotely sensed and globally available datasets (for land cover, climate, soil, population, agriculture) alongside the existing and widely used spatial ecosystem services assessment tool, Co$tingNature. With these we identify priority areas for sustainable management to realise targets under SDG 6 (water) at the country scale for Madagascar and at the basin scale for the Volta basin, though the application developed can be applied to any country or major basin in the world. Within this SDG 6 priority areas footprint, we assess the synergies and trade-offs provided by this land for SDG 15 (biodiversity) and SDG 13 (climate action) as well as SDG 2 (zero hunger).
   Results highlight the co-benefits of sustainably managing nature's contribution to SDG 6, such as the protection of forest cover (for SDG target 15.2), carbon storage as a contribution to the Paris climate agreement and nationally determined contributions (SDG 13) and biodiversity (for SDG target 15.5) but also trade-offs with the zero hunger goal (for SDG 2). Such analyses allow for better understanding of land management requirements for realising multiple SDGs through protection and restoration of green infrastructure. We provide a freely available tool, within the Co$tingNature platform, based on a variety of remotely sensed products, that can be used by SDG practitioners to carry out similar analyses and inform decision-making at national or sub-national levels globally.

AB Heterogeneous crop identification has been the subject of much concern, since smallholder farms less than 1 ha are the main agricultural form in many areas, especially China. Remote sensing with high spectral and spatial resolutions via aerial platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provides a potential alternative technique for the monitoring of heterogeneous crops in smallholder agriculture. Although this new type of remote sensing data with high spectral and spatial resolutions provides the possibility of fine classification, it also brings some challenges, such as bands contaminated with severe noise, the nonuniform distribution of the discriminative spectral information, and the spectral variability of crops. In this study, we attempted to resolve these problems by developing a robust spectral-spatial agricultural crop mapping method based on conditional random fields (SCRF), which learns the sensitive spectral information of the crops by a spectrally weighted kernel, and uses the spatial interaction of pixels to improve the classification performance. Data from a manned aircraft platform and a UAV platform were chosen to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm can effectively use the relative utility of each spectral band to detect the bands contaminated with severe noise, and it uses the spectrally weighted kernel to consider the sensitive spectral information of the crops. The algorithm with only a spectrally weighted kernel showed an improvement of more than 4% over the classical support vector machine and random forest methods. Moreover, the spatial information was proved to be of crucial importance for crop classification, and both the object-oriented method and the proposed SCRF method can improve the classification performance in terms of both visualization and the quantitative metrics by considering the spatial information. Compared with the object-oriented method, SCRF can deliver a better classification performance, with an accuracy improvement of more than 2%.

AB Artificial impervious areas are predominant indicators of human settlements. Timely, accurate, and frequent information on artificial impervious areas is critical to understanding the process of urbanization and land use/cover change, as well as of their impacts on the environment and biodiversity. Despite their importance, there still lack annual maps of high-resolution Global Artificial Impervious Areas (GAIA) with longer than 30-year records, due to the high demand of high performance computation and the lack of effective mapping algorithms. In this paper, we mapped annual GAIA from 1985 to 2018 using the full archive of 30-m resolution Landsat images on the Google Earth Engine platform. With ancillary datasets, including the nighttime light data and the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data, we improved the performance of our previously developed algorithm in arid areas. We evaluated the GAIA data for 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015, and the mean overall accuracy is higher than 90%. A cross-product comparison indicates the GAIA data are the only dataset spanning over 30 years. The temporal trend in GAIA agrees well with other datasets at the local, regional, and global scales. Our results indicate that the GAIA reached 797,076 km(2) in 2018, which is 1.5 times more than that in 1990. China and the United States (US) rank among the top two in artificial impervious area, accounting for approximately 50% of the world's total in 2018. The artificial impervious area of China surpassed that of the US in 2015. By 2018, the remaining eight among the top ten countries are India, Russia, Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, Japan, and Canada.

AB Desert vegetation-habitat complexes in dryland systems are fragile ecosystems with complex vegetation-habitat feedback, and have significant implications for natural environment protection and global climate change mitigation. However, a spatial-detailed and high-precision remote sensing method for the identification of desert vegetation-habitat complexes and characterization of their biophysical processes remain scarce. Here, we developed an innovative cross-wavelet transform (XWT)-based approach coupled with logistic regression to extract critical vegetation-habitat interaction characteristics in order to identify, map, and understand their complex ecological processes. Fine intraannual profiles between the green vegetation (GV) fraction and habitat fractions including dark material (DA), saline land (SA), sand land (SL) were unmixed by Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) from 16-period Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field of view (WFV) images in Minqin County, after which XWT was performed to extract feedback characteristics as feature parameters. Major principal components (PCs) were obtained from those feature parameters to reduce dimensions and solve multi-collinearity, logistic regression was applied for mapping. The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure efficiently reproduced desert vegetation-habitat complexes with high accuracy (overall accuracy: 87.33%; Kappa coefficient: 0.86) in the entire Minqin County, representing a 3.42% overall accuracy increase relative to a previously published decision tree (DT) method. The new method also had a lower quantity and allocation disagreement. Moreover, this procedure not only achieved comparable accuracy to that of an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) and superior to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based U-net model, but also explored biophysical processes and complex relationships with better interpretability. Therefore, the developed approach has the potential for accurately monitoring the highly heterogeneous dryland landscape and characterizing the land degradation processes in the spectral endmember space of fine spatial-temporal remote sensing data.

AB The released VIIRS DNB nightly images, also known as VIIRS DNB daily nighttime images, provide rich information for time series analysis of global socioeconomic dynamics. Anisotropic characteristic is a possible factor that influences the VIIRS DNB radiance at night and its time series analysis. This study aims to investigate the relationship between viewing angles and VIIRS DNB radiance of Suomi NPP satellite in urban areas. First, twenty-nine points were selected globally to explore the angle variation of Suomi NPP satellite views at night. We found that the variation of the satellite viewing zenith angle (VZA) is consistent (e.g. between 0 degrees and 70 degrees) since the range of VZA is fixed depending on the sensor design, and the range of viewing azimuth angle (VAA) increases with the increase of latitude. Second, thirty points in cities of Beijing, Houston, Los Angeles, Moscow, Quito and Sydney, were used to investigate the angle-radiance relationship. We proposed a zenith-radiance quadratic (ZRQ) model and a zenith-azimuth-radiance binary quadratic (ZARBQ) model to quantify the relationship between satellite viewing angles and artificial light radiance, which has been corrected by removing the moonlight and atmospheric impact from VIIRS DNB radiance products. For all the thirty points, the ZRQ and ZARBQ analysis have averaged R2 of 0.50 and 0.53, respectively, which indicates that the viewing angles are important factors influencing the variation of the artificial light radiance, but extending zenith to zenith-azimuth does not much better explain the variation of the observed artificial light. Importantly, based on the data analysis, we can make the hypothesis that building height may affect the relationship between VZA and artificial light, and cold and hot spot effects are clearly found in tall building areas. These findings are potentially useful to reconstruct more stable time series VIIRS DNB images for socioeconomic applications by removing the angular effects.

AB Monitoring vegetation carbon in tropical regions is essential to the global carbon assessment and to evaluate the actions oriented to the reduction of forest degradation. Mainly, satellite optical vegetation indices and LiDAR data have been used to this purpose. These two techniques are limited by cloud cover and are sensitive only to the top of vegetation. In addition, the vegetation attenuation to the soil microwave emission, represented by the vegetation optical depth (VOD), has been applied for biomass estimation using frequencies ranging from 4 to 30 GHz (C- to K-bands). Atmosphere is transparent to microwaves and their sensitivity to canopy layers depends on the frequency, with lower frequencies having greater penetration depths. In this regard, L-band VOD (1.4 GHz) is expected to enhance the ability to estimate carbon stocks. This study compares the sensitivity of different VOD products (from L, C, and X-bands) and an optical vegetation index (EVI) to the above-ground carbon density (ACD). It quantifies the contribution of ACD and forest cover proportion to the VOD/EVI signals. The study is conducted in Peru, southern Colombia and Panama, where ACD maps have been derived from airborne LiDAR. Results confirm the enhanced sensitivity of L-band VOD to ACD when compared to higher frequency bands, and show that the sensitivity of all VOD bands decreases in the densest forests. ACD explains 34% and forest cover 30% of L-band VOD variance, and these proportions gradually decrease for EVI, C-, and X-band VOD, respectively. Results are consistent through different categories of altitude and carbon density. This pattern is found in most of the studied regions and in flooded forests. Results also show that C-, X-band VOD and EVI provide complementary information to L-band VOD, especially in flooded forests and in mountains, indicating that synergistic approaches could lead to improved retrievals in these regions. Although the assessment of vegetation carbon in the densest forests requires further research, results from this study support the use of new L-band VOD estimates for mapping the carbon of tropical forests.

AB In the last years the Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) technology has been playing an ever greater role in the realization of compact, light and cheap Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems to be mounted onboard small, low altitude platforms such as airplanes, helicopters and drones.
   To correctly focus FMCW SAR images, it is necessary to accurately know some system parameters, including the frequency sweep rate of the signal transmitted by the radar. It may happen, however, that this frequency sweep rate is not very accurately measured by the radar provider, and thus an incorrect value of this parameter is used during the SAR data focusing procedure. This may produce serious geometric distortion effects in the focused FMCW SAR images. To circumvent these problems, in this work we present a procedure that estimates the frequency sweep rate actually employed by the FMCW radar, thus providing a key information that can be then profitably used to achieve the correct focusing of the SAR data acquired by the radar system at hand. More specifically, we propose an algorithm that exploits on one side the focused SAR images corrupted by the geometric distortion effects induced by the inaccurate knowledge of this radar parameter, and on the other side the very precise in-situ measurements of the positions of a limited number of Corner Reflectors (CRs) properly deployed over the observed scene.
   The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm has been tested on real data acquired by an airborne X-band FMCW SAR system.

AB Wildland fire is common and widespread in Alaskan tundra. Tundra fires exert considerable influence on local ecosystem functioning and contribute to climate change through biogeochemical (e.g. carbon cycle) and biogeophysical (e.g. albedo) effects. These treeless landscapes are characterized by a high degree of variation in fuel loading at scales much finer than moderate (30 m) satellite observations. However, because of the remoteness of the tundra and its lower contribution to carbon release compared to boreal forests, most frequently tundra fuels are poorly characterized, limiting the effective development of tundra-specific fire occurrence and behavior models. This study presents an approach to mapping the fractional coverages of major fuel type components in Alaskan tundra circa 2015 combining field data and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager observations. We adopt a multi-step Random Forest method to estimate the fractional vegetation cover of woody, herbaceous, and nonvascular components at subpixel level. We demonstrate the strong capability of exploiting multi-seasonal spectral information to identify these component types, with R-squared values around 0.95 and root mean squared errors below 10% for predicting their fractional cover. Our mapping products depict the spatial distribution of woody, herbaceous, and nonvascular components at subpixel resolution across Alaskan tundra, which can function as a critical input for studying wildland fire risk and behavior in the tundra. The distributions of these fuel components align well with climate-based tundra ecoregions although climate variables are not included in our models.

AB Currently, in-situ data and the time duration of altimeter data are limitations in calculating the water level and water volume of lakes and reservoirs from remotely sensed data. A novel method is proposed to estimate the temporal change in water levels and water volumes for lakes with only remotely sensed data. First, the surface profiles, including the ground and the underwater bottom, were extracted from the MABEL (Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar) photon-counting lidar raw data via a new surface detecting algorithm. Second, the lake boundaries between land and water in different years were identified using a thresholding method based on the annual median Landsat composite. Third, water levels were calculated by matching the lidar surface profiles with the lake boundaries based on the nearby georeferenced coordinates. Finally, the water volumes in different years were estimated via the contours (i.e., lake boundaries) with different elevations. Lake Mead was selected as the study area, which is the largest reservoir in the United States in terms of water capacity. With only one day measuring lidar points in February 2012 and over 20 years of Landsat images (from 1987 to 2007), the water levels and water volumes in different years were estimated and compared with the in-situ data. Our results performed well in accordance with the in-situ measurements; the R-square of the water levels and water volumes were both over 0.99; the RMSE of the interannual variations of water levels and water volumes were 0.96 m and 0.31 km(3), respectively. The MABEL was used as a technology demonstrator for the satellite photon-counting laser altimeter and had similar data to the ICESat-2 dataset. Future ICESat-2 datasets will broaden this method to estimate water volumes for remote lakes from the 1980s, where no in-situ data are available (such as the Tibetan Plateau and polar regions with thousands of remote and wild lakes), which could not be achieved in previous studies.

AB Scattering and re-absorption have been recognized as relevant aspects for the interpretation of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) in vegetation remote sensing. In an earlier study [Yang and Van der Tol, RSE 215, 97-108, 20181 we addressed the problem of scattering and re-absorption of near-infrared fluorescence in the vegetation canopy. In this study we analyse within-leaf re-absorption of both red and near-infrared fluorescence using the radiative transfer model Fluspect. The leaf scattering determines the ratio of backward to total leaf fluorescence emission F-b/(F-b + F-f). Fluspect reproduces this ratio with an RMSE of less than 0.1, and explains the observed dependence of the spectral shape of this ratio on chlorophyll content and other leaf properties. We further provide a theoretical evaluation of how asymmetric SIF emission affects the SIF of a whole canopy and explain why recent within-canopy scattering models for fluorescence are not valid for red SIF.

AB Snow interception in cold regions needleleaf forest canopies is a crucial process that controls local snow accumulation and redistribution over > 20% of the Earth's land surface. Various ground-based methods exist to measure intercepted snow load, however all are based on single-tree measurements and are difficult to implement. No research has focussed on detecting large areal intercepted snow loads and no studies have assessed the use of satellite observations. In this study, four remote sensing indices (NDSI, NDVI, albedo, and land surface temperature (LST)) were retrieved from Landsat images to study their sensitivity to canopy intercepted snow and the possibility of using them to detect the presence of intercepted snow. The results indicate that presence of intercepted snow on canopy increased NDSI and albedo, but decreased NDVI. Intercepted snow presence also decreased the areal variability of NDSI and NDVI while increasing that of albedo. For these three indices, the differences between snow-free and snowcovered canopies were correlated to topography and forest canopy cover. Of these indices, NDSI changed the greatest. Intercepted snow noticeably decreased the LST difference between forest and open areas in springtime while the influence in wintertime was relatively smaller. An intercepted snow detection approach that uses both NDSI and NDVI to classify pixels into either snowcovered canopy or other (snow-free canopy and non-forest areas) is proposed here. A case study applying this approach compared remote sensing detection to simulations by the snow interception and sublimation model implemented in the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM). This used local meteorological observations from the pine, spruce and fir forest covered Marmot Creek Research Basin in the Canadian Rockies. The remote sensing detection of intercepted snow agreed well with CRHM simulations for continuous forests (83%) and less well for sparse forests (72%) and clearings with small trees (70%). Therefore, the approach is suitable for intercepted snow detection over continuous evergreen canopies. This technique provides a new capability for large-scale snow interception model validation and data assimilation to cold regions hydrological forecasting models.

AB Accuracy assessment and land cover mapping have been inexorably linked throughout the first 50 years of publication of Remote Sensing of Environment. The earliest developers of land-cover maps recognized the importance of evaluating the quality of their maps, and the methods and reporting format of these early accuracy assessments included features that would be familiar to practitioners today. Specifically, practitioners have consistently recognized the importance of obtaining high quality reference data to which the map is compared, the need for sampling to collect these reference data, and the role of an error matrix and accuracy measures derived from the error matrix to summarize the accuracy information. Over the past half century these techniques have undergone refinements to place accuracy assessment on a more scientifically credible footing. We describe the current status of accuracy assessment that has emerged from nearly 50 years of practice and identify opportunities for future advances. The article is organized by the three major components of accuracy assessment, the sampling design, response design, and analysis, focusing on good practice methodology that contributes to a rigorous, informative, and honest assessment. The long history of research and applications underlying the current practice of accuracy assessment has advanced the field to a mature state. However, documentation of accuracy assessment methods needs to be improved to enhance reproducibility and transparency, and improved methods are required to address new challenges created by advanced technology that has expanded the capacity to map land cover extensively in space and intensively in time.

AB Solar radiation is the ultimate energy resource of earth surface energy balance and the main driving force of atmospheric, ecological and hydrological processes. Solar radiation over complex terrain has large spatial and temporal variation because of terrain shading and high cloud heterogeneity. While most existing GIS-based solar radiation models only work under clear sky condition, this research presents a solar radiation model which considers both terrain shading and anisotropic cloud attenuation and diffuse radiation using MODIS atmospheric products. Specifically, we use skyshed map, sky cloud maps, and sky weight map to represent angular distribution of sky obstruction, anisotropic cloud properties, and diffuse radiance over hemispherical sky, respectively. Combining skyshed map, sky weight map and sky cloud maps, we develop a solar radiation model where 3D geometrical relationships among sun, cloud, and terrain are considered and anisotropic diffuse radiance and cloud attenuation are modeled. Model results are evaluated using field observations in the Kunlun Mountains of western China. At Terra and Aqua overpass time, our model performs well with a mean relative bias (MRB) of -0.2%. It underestimates in clear and partly cloudy sky with a MRB of -5.86% and -4.79% and has a mean absolute relative bias (MARB) of 8.11% and 21.59% respectively. It overestimates under overcast sky with a MRB of 1.68% and has a MARB of 31.71%. Our model performs better when compared with existing instantaneous solar radiation products. For daily solar radiation, our model shows good performance with a MRB of 1.43% and MARB of 17.02%. Our model shows significant spatial variation of solar radiation within the study area with the influences from terrain and cloud. Our research provides a novel and improved approach to assimilating remote sensing data into GIS-based solar radiation modeling in mountainous terrain where observations are sparse and difficult to obtain.

AB Cloud and cloud shadow segmentation is a crucial pre-processing step for any application that uses multi spectral satellite images. In particular, disaster related applications (e.g., flood monitoring or rapid damage mapping), which are highly time- and data-critical, require methods that produce accurate cloud and cloud shadow masks in short time while being able to adapt to large variations in the target domain (induced by atmospheric conditions, different sensors, scene properties, etc.). In this study, we propose a data-driven approach to semantic segmentation of cloud and cloud shadow in single date images based on a modified U-Net convolutional neural network that aims to fulfil these requirements. We train the network on a global database of Landsat OLI images for the segmentation of five classes ("shadow", "cloud", "water", "land" and "snow/ice"). We compare the results to state-of-the-art methods, proof the model's generalization ability across multiple satellite sensors (Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2) and show the influence of different training strategies and spectral band combinations on the performance of the segmentation. Our method consistently outperforms Fmask and a traditional Random Forest classifier on a globally distributed multi-sensor test dataset in terms of accuracy, Cohen's Kappa coefficient, Dice coefficient and inference speed. The results indicate that a reduced feature space composed solely of red, green, blue and near-infrared bands already produces good results for all tested sensors. If available, adding shortwave-infrared bands can increase the accuracy. Contrast and brightness augmentations of the training data further improve the segmentation performance. The best performing U-Net model achieves an accuracy of 0.89, Kappa of 0.82 and Dice coefficient of 0.85, while running the inference over 896 test image tiles with 44.8 s/megapixel (2.8 s/megapixel on GPU). The Random Forest classifier reaches an accuracy of 0.79, Kappa of 0.65 and Dice coefficient of 0.74 with 3.9 s/megapixel inference time (on CPU) on the same training and testing data. The rule-based Fmask method takes significantly longer (277.8 s/megapixel) and produces results with an accuracy of 0.75, Kappa of 0.60 and Dice coefficient of 0.72.

AB High spatial resolution maps of land surface energy, water and CO2 fluxes, e.g. evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary productivity (GPP), are important for agricultural monitoring, ecosystem and water resources management. However, it is not clear which is the optimal (e.g. coarsest possible) spatial resolution to capture those fluxes accurately. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can address this by collecting very high spatial resolution ( < 1 m, VHR) imagery. The objective of this study is to model ET and GPP dynamics using VHR optical and thermal imagery and quantify the influence of the spatial heterogeneity in the flux simulations and validations. The study was conducted at a deciduous willow bioenergy eddy covariance (EC) flux site in Denmark. Flight campaigns were conducted during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 with a hexacopter equipped with RGB, multispectral and thermal infrared cameras. A 'top-down' modeling approach consisting of the Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model and a light use efficiency model sharing the same canopy biophysical constraints was used to estimate ET and GPP. Model outputs were benchmarked by EC flux observations with the source weighted footprint. Our results indicate that our model can well estimate the instantaneous net radiation, ET, GPP, evaporative fraction, light use efficiency and water use efficiency with root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) of 31.6 W.m(-2), 41.2 W.m(-2), 3.12 mu mol.C.m(-2).s(-1), 0.08, 0.16 g.C.MJ(-1) and 0.35 g.C.kg(-1), respectively. Further, it is found that using a footprint model to sample different areas of VHR imagery can be a tool to provide better diurnal estimates to benchmark with EC data. Moreover, these VHR maps (0.3 m) allowed us to quantify metrics of spatial heterogeneity by using semivariogram analysis and by aggregating model inputs into different spatial resolutions. For instance, we find that in this site, the aggregation of simulated GPP using the source weighted mean of the EC footprint was about 30% lower in RMSD than using the arithmetic mean of the footprint. This demonstrates the accuracy of the modeled VHR spatial patterns. Nevertheless, we also find that imagery resolution consistent with the canopy size (around 1.5 m in our study) is sufficient to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the fluxes as transpiration and canopy assimilation of CO2 are processes regulated at the tree crown level. Our results highlight the importance of considering the land surface heterogeneity for flux modeling and the source contribution within the EC footprint for model benchmarking at appropriate spatial resolutions.

AB The main sources of global soil moisture information are remote sensing observations and land surface model estimates. Data assimilation (DA) aims at optimally combining these data sources through statistical merging. To properly parameterize such merging, one needs to obtain accurate knowledge of model and observation uncertainties, which is the crux of a successful DA system. In this paper, we propose a new Monte Carlo based adaptive Kalman filtering framework (MadKF) that estimates model and observation uncertainties (Q and R) and updates soil moisture forecasts simultaneously. Spatially distributed uncertainties are estimated by applying triple collocation analysis (TCA) to Monte Carlo simulations of the model open-loop, the model analysis, and the observation time series at each grid cell. Error cross-covariances, which are inevitable between these time series, are diagnosed from their ensembles and used to iteratively correct biases they cause in Q and R estimates, and hence, in the Kalman filter gain. The proposed MadKF is tested in a synthetic environment and by assimilating real satellite soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) into the Antecedent Precipitation Index (API) model forced with daily aggregated satellite precipitation. Synthetic experiments indicate a good convergence of Q and R estimates. Internal DA diagnostics, i.e., the innovation auto-correlation (IAC) and the variance of the normalized innovations, asymptotically converge to their desired values, which indicates that the filter is operating near its optimum and reliably estimates analysis uncertainty. Real-data experiments assimilating ASCAT observations into the API model further indicate that the MadKF is robust against observation error auto-correlations, which typically cause problems in conventional IAC-tuning based adaptive filtering approaches. A performance evaluation over 264 in situ sites within the contiguous United States shows that the MadKF leads to a significant skill gain in surface soil moisture estimation. The MadKF is also potentially applicable when assimilating Level 1 backscatter or brightness temperature observations, or when updating/assimilating other geophysical variables.

AB Scientific contributions from remote sensing over the last fifty years have significantly advanced our understanding of urban areas. Key contributions of urban remote sensing include but are not limited to characterization of urban areas, urban land cover changes and thermal remote sensing of urban climates. Today, the proliferation of new sensors, long time series of the satellite record, joint analysis of Earth observation data with ancillary data sets, widespread availability of high-performance computing facilities, and slow but increasing use of remote sensing data and methods in non-remote sensing fields together offer new opportunities to generate scientific knowledge for an urbanizing planet. Simultaneously, the scale and pace of contemporary urbanization require new information about urban areas from both the science and policy communities. This paper examines remote sensing contributions to the scientific understanding of urban areas over the last 50 years until today. Based on this assessment and current needs by user communities, we identify four strategic directions for future urban remote sensing research: high temporal frequency analysis, characterization of urban heterogeneity, characterization of urban form and structure in two and three dimensions, and linking remote sensing with emerging urban data. Advances in these four areas are likely to generate significant new insights that will be useful to both science and policy.

AB Himawari-8 (H8) is a geostationary meteorological satellite launched by JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) and is now operated by JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency). It takes measurements at a temporal resolution of 10 min for full disk view. Although designed as a meteorological satellite, the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard H8 has three visible (460, 510 and 640 nm), one near infrared (860 nm) and two shortwave infrared bands (1610 and 2257 nm) to observe the Earth system. In this study, the Floating Algae Index (FAI) developed for ocean color satellites (Hu, 2009) is adapted to process AHI data for the first time and applied for waters of Lake Taihu, China. For a total of 18 near-cloud-free images, a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.92 was obtained between the algae area derived from AHI FAI and that from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) FAI, and the mean percentage difference is similar to 5% in algae coverage. More concurrent images (n = 80) were collected for a comparison between AHI and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), as GOCI is also a geostationary satellite, resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and percentage deviation of similar to 8% in observed algae coverage. These results indicate that H8/AHI can obtain reliable observations of floating algae at ultrahigh temporal resolutions (10 min). Especially, such ultrahigh-frequency measurements show that part of Lake Taihu (e.g., Meiliang Bay) experienced more frequent events of floating algae (mostly > 60%) than that observed by GOCI (generally < 40%). These results indicate that ultrahigh-frequency measurements are important not only for efficient environmental monitoring but also for the scientific understanding of algae dynamics.

AB Hurricane Harvey caused unprecedented flooding and socioeconomic devastation in Eastern Texas with high winds, elevated storm tide, and record rainfall. The flooded area is mapped using the radar backscattering difference between Sentinel-1A/B satellite acquisitions spanning the event, which provides a snapshot of standing water at the time of image acquisition. We find vast areas outside of designated flood hazard zones are overwhelmed. Furthermore, we map pre-cyclone land subsidence using multitemporal interferometric processing of large SAR datasets acquired by Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) and Sentinel-1A/B satellites. We find that subsidence of up to 49 mm/yr and 34 mm/yr during the ALOS (Jul-2007-Jan-2011) and Sentinel-1A/B (Dec-2015 to Aug-2017) acquisition periods affect various parts of Houston-Galveston area. We conclude that 85% of the flooded area subsided at a rate > 5 mm/yr. We suggest that subsidence affected flood severity by modifying base flood elevations and topographic gradients, supported by the Chi-square test of independence. This work highlights the importance of incorporating InSAR measurements of land subsidence in flood resilience strategies.

TI Inconsistencies in scatterometer wind products based on ASCAT and

AB Sea surface vector winds from multiple satellite scatterometers are especially useful for oceanic and atmospheric applications. On the one hand, the number of space-borne scatterometers is increasing in recent years. On the other hand, the homogenization of wind products from different scatterometers and producers remains a challenge, which potentially prevents the beneficial use of multiple scatterometers for numerical weather prediction, studying air-sea interactions or monitoring and forecasting the ocean. In this study, the inconsistencies in scatterometer wind products are analyzed and differences are attributed to the different aspects of scatterometer wind measurements and processing in order to guide further research towards consistent scatterometer wind products. More in particular, the collocated C-band MetOp/ASCAT and Ku-band SCATSAT-1/OSCAT-2 data allow a unique opportunity for close and abundant global collocations of different scatterometer wind products. The Ku-band wind data are independently produced by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The comparison shows that the KNMI OSCAT-2 wind product rejects more "poor" quality data than the JPL wind product, while both quality control (QC) schemes have merits and may be combined in a future development. Furthermore, the JPL OSCAT-2 wind speeds differ generally more from the ASCAT winds than the KNMI OSCAT-2 winds, especially for wind speeds above 17 m/s. It is confirmed that the wind speed differences between C- and Ku-band scatterometers are mainly caused by the effect of Sea Surface Temperature (SST). While the wind direction characteristics of the OSCAT-2 wind products are closely related to the inversion algorithms used, the geophysical model function (GMF) used in the wind inversion is the dominant factor for the remarkable differences between OSCAT-2 wind speeds produced by KNMI and JPL. The error characteristics and inconsistencies of ASCAT and OSCAT-2 wind products presented in this manuscript provide guidance for data users and will promote further improvements in the consistency of scatterometer wind products.

AB Satellite remote sensing has been widely used in the last decades for agricultural applications, both for assessing vegetation condition and for subsequent yield prediction. Existing remote sensing-based methods to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP), which is an important variable to indicate crop photosynthetic function and stress, typically rely on empirical or semi-empirical approaches, which tend to over-simplify photosynthetic mechanisms. In this work, we take advantage of all parallel developments in mechanistic photosynthesis modeling and satellite data availability for an advanced monitoring of crop productivity. In particular, we combine process-based modeling with the soil-canopy energy balance radiative transfer model (SCOPE) with Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 optical remote sensing data and machine learning methods in order to estimate crop GPP. With this approach, we by-pass the need for an intermediate step to retrieve the set of vegetation biophysical parameters needed to accurately model photosynthesis, while still accounting for the complex processes of the original physically-based model. Several implementations of the machine learning models are tested and validated using simulated and flux tower-based GPP data. Our final neural network model is able to estimate GPP at the tested flux tower sites with r(2) of 0.92 and RMSE of 1.38 gC d(-1) m(-2), which outperforms empirical models based on vegetation indices. The first test of applicability of this model to Landsat 8 data showed good results (r(2) of 0.82 and RMSE of 1.97 gC d(-1) m(-2)), which suggests that our approach can be further applied to other sensors. Modeling and testing is restricted to C3 crops in this study, but can be extended to C4 crops by producing a new training dataset with SCOPE that accounts for the different photosynthetic pathways. Our model successfully estimates GPP across a variety of C3 crop types and environmental conditions even though it does not use any local information from the corresponding sites. This highlights its potential to map crop productivity from new satellite sensors at a global scale with the help of current Earth observation cloud computing platforms.

AB This study explores the use of Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) global meteorological and aerosol reanalysis for improving the simulation of satellite sensor infrared brightness temperatures (BTs), and the retrieval of sea surface temperature (SST) in the NOAA Advanced Clear Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) system, with a particular focus on ACSPO long-term reprocessing efforts. Using MERRA-2 upper-air pressure, temperature, and humidity profiles, rather than the currently used NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) real-time data, as input into the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM), reduces the global clear-sky observation-minus-model (O-M) BT biases in the infrared bands centered at 3.7, 8.6, 11, and 12 mu m of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite onboard Suomi-NPP. The improvements are largely due to more accurate water vapor (total amount and/or vertical distribution) at low latitudes in MERRA-2, which brings the modeled BTs closer to observations. Additional stand-alone simulations, performed using R'FTOV model and MERRA-2 aerosol profiles, further reduce the ACSPO global O-M BT biases and the dependence of O-M BT biases on the dust aerosol optical depth. The potential skill of MERRA-2 aerosol reanalysis for reducing dust-caused regional biases in the ACSPO global regression SST product is also demonstrated. Preliminary results suggest that MERRA-2 is a viable alternative to NCEP GFS for ACSPO reprocessing efforts.

AB Two caprock and cover collapse sinkholes, Wink Sinks #1 and #2, in Winkler County, Texas, collapsed in 1980 and 2002, respectively. They are located in a region underlain by the Salado Formation on the eastern edge of the Delaware Basin. The sinkhole collapses were associated with intense hydrocarbon drilling and production activities in the Hendrick oilfield. Production records and prior investigations imply the sinkholes developed after salt dissolution due to freshwater intrusion, cavity formation, roof failure, and successive upward cavity migration. High-resolution (1 m) aerial photography shows the ensuing expansion of Wink Sink #2 from 2002 through 2010 and relative stability of the ground surface after 2010. Very high-resolution (25 cm) staring spotlight mode TerraSAR-X reveals the spatiotemporal details of Wink sinkhole deformations. The vicinities around the two existing sinkholes (Wink Sinks #1, #2) deformed at a rate of 5 cm/yr in line-of-sight (LOS) direction from October 2015 to March 2016, and the deformation was possibly caused by the gradual deposit of the debris from overlying unconsolidated Alluvium and Santa Rosa sandstones infilling the cavity after the sinkhole collapse. Specifically, the largest deformation of 53 cm/yr in LOS direction was found 1 km east of Wink Sink #2. Our study suggests that severe drought in 2011 widened and created fractures as well as ground fissures in the rocks overlying and underlying the salt formation due to the increased effective stress. Fractures, ground fissures, and the abandoned unplugged boreholes or improperly completed wells opened one or more vertical pathways of freshwater from groundwater flow and precipitation toward the salt bed, finally causing the rapid salt dissolution and the opening of new cavities. To explain the onset of a rapid subsidence near the Wink sinkholes, our study considers the combined effect of natural perturbation (i.e., drought, rock fractures, ground fissures, subsurface drainage, precipitation) and anthropogenic effects (i.e., improper well control). Our method to explore high-resolution imagery can be applied to characterize the sinkhole deformation and mitigate sinkhole-related geohazards.

AB Quantification of forest aboveground biomass density (AGB) is useful in forest carbon cycle studies, biodiversity protection and climate-change mitigation actions. However, a finer resolution and spatially continuous forest AGB map is inaccessible at national level in China. In this study, we developed forest type- and ecozone-specific allometric models based on 1607 field plots. The allometric models were applied to Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data to calculate AGB at the footprint level. We then mapped a 30 m resolution national forest AGB by relating the GLAS footprint AGB to various variables derived from Landsat images and Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data. We estimated the average forest AGB to be 69.88 Mg/ha with a standard deviation of 35.38 Mg/ha and the total AGB carbon stock to be 5.44 PgC in China. Our AGB estimates corresponded reasonably well with AGB inventories from the top ten provinces in the forested area, and the coefficient of determination and root mean square error were 0.73 and 20.65 Mg/ha, respectively. We found that the main uncertainties for AGB estimation could be attributed to errors in allometric models and in height measurements by the GLAS. We also found that Landsat-derived variables outperform PALSAR-derived variables and that the textural features of PALSAR better support forest AGB estimates than backscattered intensity.

AB The linear polarization of sunlight reflected by ocean surfaces in the short-wave infrared (SWIR), at geometries where specular reflection dominates the signal, is a direct function of the refractive index of the surface microlayer (SML). This simple physical concept is at the base of a novel technique presented in this study. We invert observations obtained by the airborne Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) in the sunglint region, where each pixel's radiance is dominated by the signal originating from the wave slopes oriented precisely to cause specular reflection. The SWIR wavelength ensures minimization of aerosol interference when radiance travels through the atmosphere; strong absorption by the water body then limits the penetration depth to the first micrometer or so, effectively probing the SML. The resulting Degree of Linear Polarization (DoLP) is then governed by the refractive index via the Fresnel law for the specific pixel geometry, independently of the windspeed. The selected dataset concerns several field deployments from both low- and high-altitude aircraft, including total reflectance measurements with the sole purpose of accounting for the residual aerosol effect. Stable retrievals from transects above pure seawater yielded values of refractive index that match the values published in the literature within an accuracy of 5 x 10(-4). Flying over the oil spill caused by the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon platform, detected variations were found compatible with the presence of an oil slick. The robustness of the results, guaranteed by the high RSP polarimetric accuracy (<= 0.2%), opens the possibility for remote-sensing detection of other entities that similarly affect the refractive index including whitecaps, microplastics, biological gels, seaweed and grass mats.

AB The Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission, launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) on 31st January 2015, was designed to provide global soil moisture every 2 to 3 days at 9 km resolution by downscaling SMAP passive microwave observations obtained at 36 km resolution using active microwave observations at 3 km resolution, and then retrieving soil moisture from the resulting 9 km brightness temperature product. This study evaluated the SMAP Active/Passive (AP) downscaling algorithm together with other resolution enhancement techniques. Airborne passive microwave observations acquired at 1 km resolution over the Murrumbidgee River catchment in south-eastern Australia during the fourth and fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiments (SMAPEx-4/5) were used as reference data. The SMAPEx-4/5 data were collected in May and September 2015, respectively, and aggregated to 9 km for direct comparison with a number of available resolution-enhanced brightness temperature estimates. The results show that the SMAP AP downscaled brightness temperature had a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.84 and Root-Mean-Squared Error (RMSE) of similar to 10 K, while SMAP Enhanced, Nearest Neighbour, Weighted Average, and the Smoothing Filter-based Modulation (SFIM) brightness temperature estimates had somewhat better performance (RMSEs of similar to 7 K and an R exceeding 0.9). Although the SFIM had the lowest unbiased RMSE of similar to 6 K, the effect of cloud cover on Ka-band observations limits data availability.

AB The assessment of the health conditions of trees in forests is extremely important for biodiversity, forest management, global environment monitoring, and carbon dynamics. There is a vast amount of research using remote sensing (RS) techniques for the assessment of the current condition of a forest, but only a small number of these are concerned with detection and classification of dead trees. Among the available RS techniques, only the airborne laser scanner (ALS) enables dead tree detection at the single tree level with high accuracy.
   The main objective of the study was to identify spruce, pine and deciduous trees by alive or dead classifications. Three RS data sets including ALS (leaf-on and leaf-off) and color-infrared (CIR) imagery (leaf-on) were used for the study. We used intensity and structural variables from the ALS data and spectral information derived from aerial imagery for the classification procedure. Additionally, we tested the differences in the classification accuracy of all variants contained in the data integration. In the study, the random forest (RF) classifier was used. The study was carried out in the Polish part of the Bialowieia Forest (BF).
   In general, we can state that all classifications, with different combinations of ALS features and CIR, resulted in high overall accuracy (OA >= 90%) and Kappa (kappa > 0.86). For the best variant (CIR_ALS(WSn-FH)), the mean values of overall accuracy and Kappa were equal to 94.3% and 0.93, respectively. The leaf -on point cloud features alone produced the lowest accuracies (OA = 75-81% and x = 0.68-0.76). Improvements of 0-0.04 in the Kappa coefficient and 0-3.1% in the overall classification accuracy were found after the point cloud normalization for all variants. Full -height point cloud features (F) produced lower accuracies than the results based on features calculated for half of the tree height point clouds (H) and combined FH.
   The importance of each of the predictors for different data sets for tree species classification provided by the RF algorithm was investigated. The lists of top features were the same, independent of intensity normalization. For the classification based on both of the point clouds (leaf on and leaf-off), three structural features (a proportion of first returns for both half -height and full -height variants and the canopy relief ratio of points) and two intensity features from first returns and half -height variant (the coefficient of variation and skewness) were rated as the most important. In the classification based on the point cloud with CIR features, two image features were among the most important (the NDVI and mean value of reflectance in the green band).

AB A practical atmospheric correction algorithm, called Coupled Moderate Products for Atmospheric Correction (CMPAC), was developed and implemented for the Multispectral Camera (MUX) on-board the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-4). This algorithm uses a scene-based processing and sliding window technique to derive MUX surface reflectance (SR) at continental scale. Unlike other optical sensors, MUX instrument imposes constraints for atmospheric correction due to the absence of spectral bands for aerosol estimation from imagery itself. To overcome this limitation, the proposed algorithm performs a further processing of atmospheric products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors as input parameters for radiative transfer calculations. The success of CMPAC algorithm was fully assessed and confirmed by comparison of MUX SR data with the Landsat-8 OLI Level-2 and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET)-derived SR products. The spectral adjustment was performed to compensate for the differences of relative spectral response between MUX and OLI sensors. The results show that MUX SR values are fairly similar to operational Landsat-8 SR products (mean difference < 0.0062, expressed in reflectance). There is a slight underestimation of MUX SR compared to OLI product (except the NIR band), but the error metrics are typically low and scattered points are around the line 1:1. These results suggest the potential of combining these datasets (MUX and OLI) for quantitative studies. Further, the robust agreement of MUX and AERONET-derived SR values emphasizes the quality of moderate atmospheric products as input parameters in this application, with root-mean-square deviation lower than 0.0047. These findings confirm that (i) CMPAC is a suitable tool for estimating surface reflectance of CBERS MUX data, and (ii) ancillary products support the application of atmospheric correction by filling the gap of atmospheric information. The uncertainties of atmospheric products, negligence of the bidirectional effects, and two aerosol models were also identified as a limitation. Finally, this study presents a framework basis for atmospheric correction of CBERS-4 MUX images. The utility of CBERS data comes from its use, and this new product enables the quantitative remote sensing for land monitoring and environmental assessment at 20 m spatial resolution.

AB Lidar provides critical information on the three-dimensional structure of forests. However, collecting wall-towall laser altimetry data at regional and global scales is cost prohibitive. As a result, studies employing lidar for large area estimation typically collect data via strip sampling, leaving large swaths of the forest unmeasured by the instrument. The goal of this research was to develop and examine the performance of a coregionalization modeling approach for combining field measurements, strip samples of airborne lidar and Landsat-based remote sensing products to predict aboveground biomass (AGB) in interior Alaska's Tanana Valley. The proposed modeling strategy facilitates mapping of AGB density across the domain. Additionally, the coregionalization framework allows for estimation of total AGB for arbitrary areal units within the study area a key advance to support diverse management objectives in interior Alaska. This research focuses on characterization of prediction uncertainty in the form of posterior predictive coverage intervals and standard deviations. Using the framework detailed here, it is possible to quantify estimation uncertainty for any spatial extent, ranging from point level predictions of AGB density to estimates of AGB stocks for the full domain. The lidar-informed coregionalization models consistently outperformed their counterpart lidar-free models in terms of point-level predictive performance and total (mean) AGB precision. Additionally, including a Landsat-derived forest cover covariate further improved precision in regions with lower lidar sampling intensity. Findings also demonstrate that model-based approaches not explicitly accounting for residual spatial dependence can grossly underestimate uncertainty, resulting in falsely precise estimates of AGB. The inferential capabilities of AGB posterior predictive distribution (PPD) products extend beyond simply mapping AGB density. We show how PPD products can provide insight regarding drivers of AGB heterogeneity in boreal forests, including permafrost and fire, highlighting the range of potential applications for Bayesian geostatistical methods to integrate field, airborne and satellite data.

AB Slow-moving landslides are numerous in mountainous areas and pose a large threat to populations. Many observations show that their kinematics is driven by climatic forcings and earthquakes. In this study, we document the complex interaction between those two forcings on the slow-moving landslide kinematics, based on the retrieval of landslide displacements over 28-years using optical satellite images. To overcome the decorrelation effect over this large time-span, and possible misalignment between images, we develop a method that uses the redundancy of displacement fields from image pairs to derive a robust time-series of displacement. The method is tested on the 28-year long SPOT1/5-Pleiades archive, over an area in Peru affected by both earthquakes and rainfall. Errors are estimated on stable areas and by comparison with one 13-year long and eleven 3-year long GPS time-series on the Maca landslide. The methodology diminishes by up to 30% the uncertainty and reduces significantly the gaps due to decorrelation. The data set allows detecting 3 major landslides, moving at a rate of 35 to 50 m over 28 years, and smaller landslides with lower displacement rates. Time-series obtained over the three main landslides provide interesting results of their long-term kinematics, primarily driven by precipitation. We propose simple statistical hydro-kinematic models, relating yearly motion to seasonal rainfall, to explain the observed time-series. We found that annual precipitation is controlling the landslide displacements after a certain rainfall threshold is reached. Besides this control, we show the possible impact of a local Mw 5.4 earthquake in 1991 on the kinematics of the Maca landslide. Our results suggest that the earthquake accelerated the landslide and has an effect during several years on the precipitation threshold required for triggering a motion. These results suggest that the rainfall threshold can vary in time following strong earthquakes shaking.

AB Understanding the scattering mechanisms from the ground surface in the presence of different vegetation densities is necessary for the interpretation of P-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations and for the design of geophysical retrieval algorithms. In this study, a quantitative analysis of vegetation and soil scattering mechanisms estimated from the observations of an airborne P-band SAR instrument across nine different biomes in North America is presented. The goal is to apply a hybrid (model-and eigen-based) three component decomposition approach to separate the contributions of surface, double-bounce and vegetation volume scattering across a wide range of biome conditions. The decomposition makes no prior assumptions about vegetation structure. We characterize the dynamics of the decomposition across different North American biomes and assess their characteristic range. Impacts of vegetation cover seasonality and soil surface roughness on the contributions of each scattering mechanism are also investigated. Observations used here are part of the NASA Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) mission and data have been collected between 2013 and 2015.

AB The structural loss rates of standing dead trees (SDTs) affect a variety of processes of interest to ecologists and foresters, yet the decomposition of SDTs has been traditionally characterized by qualitative decay classes, reductions in wood density as decay progresses, and sampling schemes focused on estimating snag longevity. By establishing a methodology to accurately and efficiently quantify SDT structural loss over time, these estimated structural loss rates would improve the performance of a variety of models and potentially provide new insight as to the manner in which SDTs undergo degradation in various conditions. The specific objective of this study were: 1) utilize the TreeVoIX algorithm to estimate the volume of 29 SDTs scanned with terrestrial lidar; 2) develop a novel, voxel-based change detection algorithm capable of providing automated structural loss estimates with multitemporal terrestrial lidar observations; and 3) estimate and characterize the structural loss rates of Pinus taeda and Quercus stellata in southeastern Texas.
   A voxel-based change detection methodology was developed to accurately detect and quantify structural losses and incorporated several methods to mitigate the challenges presented by shifting tree and branch positions as SDT decay progresses. The volume and structural loss of 29 SDTs, composed of Pinus taeda and Quercus stellata, were successfully estimated using multitemporal terrestrial lidar observations over elapsed times ranging from 71 to 753 days. Pine and oak structural loss rates were characterized by estimating the amount of volumetric loss occurring in 20 equal-interval height bins of each SDT. Results showed that large pine snags exhibited more rapid structural loss in comparison to medium-sized oak snags in southeastern Texas.

AB Long-term ground LAI measurements from the global networks of sites (e.g. FLUXNET) have emerged as a promising data source to validate remotely sensed global LAI product time-series. However, the spatial scale-mismatch issue between site and satellite observations hampers the use of such invaluable ground measurements in validation practice. Here, we propose an approach (Grading and Upscaling of Ground Measurements, GUGM) that integrates a spatial representativeness grading criterion and a spatial upscaling strategy to resolve this scale-mismatch issue and maximize the utility of time-series of site-based LAI measurements. The performance of GUGM was carefully evaluated by comparing this method to both benchmark LAI and other widely used conventional approaches. The uncertainty of three global LAI products (i.e. MODIS, GLASS and GEOV1) was also assessed based on the LAI time-series validation dataset derived from GUGM. Considering all the evaluation results together, this study suggests that the proposed GUGM approach can significantly reduce the uncertainty from spatial scale mismatch and increase the size of the available validation dataset. In particular, the proposed approach outperformed other widely used approaches in these two respects. Furthermore, GUGM was successfully implemented to validate global LAI products in various ways with advantaging frequent time-series validation dataset. The validation results of the global LAI products show that GLASS has the lowest uncertainty, followed by GEOV1 and MODIS for the overall biome types. However, MODIS provides more consistent uncertainties across different years than GLASS and GEOV1. We believe that GUGM enables us to better understand the structure of LAI product uncertainties and their evolution across seasonal or annual contexts. In turn, this method can provide fundamental information for further LAI algorithm improvements and the broad application of LAI product time-series.

AB Monitoring and classifying forest disturbance using Landsat time series has improved greatly over the past decade, with many new algorithms taking advantage of the high-quality, cost free data in the archive. Much of the innovation has been focused on use of sophisticated workflows that consist of a logical sequence of processes and rules, multiple statistical functions, and parameter sets that must be calibrated to accurately classify disturbance. For many algorithms, calibration has been local to areas of interest and the algorithm's classification performance has been good under those circumstances. When applied elsewhere, however, algorithm performance has suffered. An alternative strategy for calibration may be to use the locally tested parameter values in conjunction with a statistical approach (e.g., Random Forests; RF) to align algorithm classification with a reference disturbance dataset, a process we call secondary classification. We tested that strategy here using RF with LandTrendr, an algorithm that runs on one spectral band or index. Disturbance detection using secondary classification was spectral band- or index-dependent, with each spectral dimension providing some unique detections and different error rates. Using secondary classification, we tested whether an integrated multispectral LandTrendr ensemble, with various combinations of the six basic Landsat reflectance bands and seven common spectral indices, improves algorithm performance. Results indicated a substantial reduction in errors relative to secondary classification based on single bands/indices, revealing the importance of a multispectral approach to forest disturbance detection. To explain the importance of specific bands and spectral indices in the multispectral ensemble, we developed a disturbance signal-to-noise metric that clearly highlighted the value of shortwave infrared reflectance, especially when paired with near-infrared reflectance.

AB The ability to measure real time surface elevation over a large spatial domain offers large benefits to multiple industries, including offshore operations and marine renewable applications. In combination with a real time short-term wave prediction model safety related marine operations windows can be increased. This focuses on Quiescent Period Prediction during large sea states, and the ability of pre-emptive wave-by-wave tuning of marine energy converters leads to improved efficiencies. This study presents a new method of converting X-band radar sequence into approximate surface elevation in near real time using synthetic wave trough profile estimations, forgoing the use of a linear stochastic model. The artificial wave trough method applies a second order Stokes wave to trough regions where radar shadows occur, these shadows are caused as a result of high surround wave crest height where no surface information is gathered. The calculated surface elevation is validated against in situ sensor data at two locations, a correlation (r) of 0.69 is shown for the Signature 1000 sensor location, while a lower correlation of 0.56 is observed at the wave buoy location. When the phase-averaged wave parameters (H-m0 and T-p) derived from 20 min wave spectra for the entire duration of the measurement campaign are compared, a reasonable agreement of 0.62 and 0.41 for the AD2CP and wave buoy location is achieved. The presented method shows a good approximation of wave profile shape, where the swell component is predominantly measured, indicating the potential of X-band radar surface elevation measurements in near real time for nearshore inhomogeneous seas.

AB In this work, trend estimates are used as indicators to compare the multi-annual variability of different satellite chlorophyll-a (Chla) data and to assess the fitness-for-purpose of multi-mission Chia products as climate data records (CDR). Under the assumption that single-mission products are free from spurious temporal artifacts and can be used as benchmark time series, multi-mission CDRs should reproduce the main trend patterns observed by single-mission series when computed over their respective periods. This study introduces and applies quantitative metrics to compare trend distributions from different data records. First, contingency matrices compare the trend diagnostics associated with two satellite products when expressed in binary categories such as existence, significance and signs of trends. Contingency matrices can be further summarized by metrics such as Cohen's is index that rates the overall agreement between the two distributions of diagnostics. A more quantitative measure of the discrepancies between trends is provided by the distributions of differences between trend slopes. Thirdly, maps of the level of significance P of a t-test quantifying the degree to which two trend estimates differ provide a statistical, spatially-resolved, evaluation. The proposed methodology is applied to the multi-mission Ocean Colour-Climate Change Initiative (OCCCI) Chla data. The agreement between trend distributions associated with OC-CCI data and single-mission products usually appears as good as when single-mission products are compared. As the period of analysis is extended beyond 2012 to 2015, the level of agreement tends to be degraded, which might be at least partly due to the aging of the MODIS sensor on-board Aqua. On the other hand, the trends displayed by the OC-CCI series over the short period 2012-2015 are very consistent with those observed with VIIRS. These results overall suggest that the OC-CCI Chla data can be used for multi-annual time series analysis (including trend detection), but with some caution required if recent years are included, particularly in the central tropical Pacific. The study also recalls the challenges associated with creating a multi-mission ocean color data record suitable for climate research. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB One of the greatest challenges in monitoring food security is to provide reliable crop yield information that is temporally consistent and spatially scalable. An ideal yield dataset would not only extend globally and across multiple years, but would also have enough spatial granularity to characterize productivity at the field and sub field level. Rapid increases in satellite data acquisition and platforms such as Google Earth Engine that can efficiently access and process vast archives of new and historical data offer an opportunity to map yields globally, but require efficient and robust algorithms to combine various data streams into yield estimates. We recently introduced a Scalable satellite-based Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM) that combines crop models simulations with imagery and weather data to generate 30 m resolution yield estimates without the need for ground calibration. In this study, we tested new large-scale implementations of SCYM, focusing on three regions with varying crops, field sizes and landscape heterogeneity: maize in the U.S. corn belt (390,000 km(2)), maize in Southern Zambia (86,000 km(2)), and wheat in northern India (450,000 km(2)). As a benchmark, we also tested a simpler empirical approach (PEAKVI) that relates yield to the peak value of a time series of spatially aggregated vegetation indices, similar to methods used in current operational monitoring. Both SCYM and PEAKVI were applied to data from all Landsat's sensors and MODIS for more than a decade in each region, and evaluated against ground-based estimates at the finest available administrative level (e.g., counties in the U.S.). We found consistently high correlations (R-2 >= 0.5) between the spatial pattern of ground- and satellite-based estimates in both U.S. maize and India wheat, with small differences between methods and source of satellite data. In the U.S., SCYM outperformed PEAKVI in tracking temporal yield variations, likely owing to its explicit consideration of weather. In India, both methods failed to track temporal yield changes, with various possible explanations discussed. In Zambia, the PEAKVI approach applied to MODIS tracked yield variations much better (R-2 > 0.5) than any other yield estimate, likely because the frequent cloud cover in this region confounds the other approaches. Overall, this study demonstrates successful approaches to yield estimation in each region, and illustrates the importance of distinguishing between accuracy for spatial and temporal variation. The 30 m resolution of Landsat-based SCYM does not appear to offer large benefits for tracking aggregate yields, but enables finer scale analyses than possible with the other approaches.

AB Land cover in Beijing experienced a dramatic change due to intensive human activities, such as urbanization and afforestation. However, the spatial patterns of the dynamics are still unknown. The archived Landsat images provide an unprecedented opportunity to detect land cover changes over the past three decades. In this study, we used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trajectory to detect major land cover dynamics in Beijing. Then, we classified the land cover types in 2015 with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud calculation. By overlaying the latest land cover types and the spatial distribution of land cover dynamics, we determined the main types where a land cover change occurred. The overall change detection accuracy for three types (vegetation loss associated with negative change in NDVI, vegetation gain associated with positive change in NDVI, and no changes) is 86.13%. We found that the GEE is a fast and powerful tool for land cover mapping, and we obtained a classification map with an overall accuracy of 86.61%. Over the past 30 years, 1402.28 km(2) of land was with vegetation loss and 109038 km(2) of land was revegetated in Beijing. The spatial pattern of vegetation loss and vegetation gain shows significant differences in different zones from the center of the city. We also found that 1162.71 km(2) of land was converted to urban and built-up, whereas 918.36 km(2) of land was revegetated to cropland, shrub land, forest, and grassland. Moreover, 202.67 km(2) and 156.75 km(2) of the land was transformed to forest and shrub land in the plain of Beijing that were traditionally used for cropland and housing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this work we exploit X- and C-band InSAR data for detecting local deformation phenomena induced by the 2016-2017 Central Italy seismic sequence. Our goal is to highlight the usefulness of multi-band InSAR analysis for Hazard assessing and Rapid Mapping purposes when in-situ investigations are difficult or dangerous to be performed. Indeed, local seismic-induced effects (such as landslides, avalanches, subsidence, etc.) could severely impact the environment and the population in the surrounding of areas hit by earthquakes. We focused on four areas, named Monte Vettore, Podalla, Bolognola and Cicconi, where InSAR outcomes revealed how the main seismic events of the sequence activated several landslides and secondary faults interested by deformation of similar to 2-3 cm along the satellite Line-of-Sight (LoS). The use of multi-band InSAR data allows the observation of multi-scale deformation phenomena with both different spatial resolution and coverage, highlighting the limits and constraints of different SAR sensors. Moreover, it ensures the crosschecking of displacement patterns retrieved through different InSAR products, especially when no ground truth or in situ ancillary data are available for validation purposes. As a result, the retrieved InSAR information can support the Scientific Community and the Institutions in the management of crisis emergencies.

The aim of this paper is to inform the user community of the changes in and the evaluation of the new SPOT/VGT Collection 3 (VGTC-3). The evaluation of the reprocessing is based on (i) the relative comparison between SPOT/VGT Collection 2 (VGT-C2) and VGT-C3 surface reflectances and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), (ii) consistency analysis between VGT1-C3 and VGT2-C3, and (iii) the comparison of the archive with external datasets from METOP/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and TERRA/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Surface reflectances are slightly higher after the reprocessing, with larger differences in July compared to January, caused by the corrected Sun-Earth distance modelling. For NDVI, the overall impact of the reprocessing is relatively small and differences show no seasonality. Trends in the differences over the years are related to changes in calibration coefficients. Systematic differences between VGT1-C3 and VGT2-C3 surface reflectance are well below 1%, with largest bias between VGT1 and VGT2 for the NIR band and the NDVI (VGT2 > VGT1, especially for larger NDVI values). Both the comparison with METOP/AVHRR (surface reflectance and NDVI) and TERRA/MODIS (NDVI) reveal trends over time: systematic bias between VGT2 and METOP/AVHRR tends to decrease over time, while comparison with TERRA/MODIS indicates an increasing bias between VGT2 and MODIS. VGT2 NDVI seems to be gradually evolving to slightly larger values, which is consistent with the change in overpass time of VGT2 and the different illumination conditions caused by the orbital drift of the sensor. Results demonstrate however the SPOT/VGT-C3 archive is more stable over time compared to the previous archive, although bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) normalization is recommended in order to correct for bidirectional effects.

AB This study presents indexes developed from remote sensing observations for continuous soil surface moisture monitoring. The Modified Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI) proposed in our earlier work is developed using a time domain solution method rather than the traditional spatial domain solution method, because of limitations arising from a traditional temperature-vegetation index (TVX) method. In the procedure herein proposed, the MTVDI parameterization scheme is transformed from regional scale to pixel scale, and the boundary conditions defining maximum water stress are determined pixel by pixel using the surface energy balance principle. All the parameters required for the retrieval of MTVDI are pixel specific, thereby avoiding the limitations of the traditional spatial domain solution method. Previous studies demonstrate the applicability of the TVX method with data from only a few days of clear sky conditions. In contrast, our proposed MTVDI is demonstrated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products over the course of a full year, and the soil moisture status over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region is monitored continuously. Finally, the volumetric surface soil water content (theta(nu)) is estimated using a calibration procedure from the MTVDI retrievals. The results show that the accuracy of both MTVDI retrievals and theta(nu) estimates obtained in this work has reached a level comparable with those produced in previous studies. Across all sites, the correlation coefficient (r) between the MTVDI and theta(nu) measurements is 0.60. The values of r, mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for theta(nu) estimates are 0.75, 0.019 m(3) M-3 and 0.025 m(3) m(-3), respectively.

AB The physical environment of the intertidal zone presents a number of challenges which make traditional surveying methods difficult to implement; whilst the acquisition cost of airborne elevation data can be prohibitive beyond localised applications. Remote sensing data from earth observation satellites has been well established as a method for mapping the extent and elevation profile of the intertidal zone; however the majority of these applications are local in nature, and based on analysis of a limited number of individual image observations.
   In this paper we outline an automated methodology to model the intertidal extent and topography of the Australian coastline, that leverages a full time series of Landsat observations from 1987 to 2015 managed in the Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC). Our approach reframes the analysis from time of acquisition into the tidal domain through the use of a continental scale tidal model, combined with a median pixel compositing of Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) stacks, to robustly estimate the tidal extent and elevation profile across the observed tidal range. We demonstrate the ability of a median-based compositing approach to deal effectively with data quality, modelling outliers and other issues that commonly affect single scene methodologies. Our new framework enables us to produce a continental-scale intertidal model, detailing intertidal zone topography at a 25 m spatial scale.
   We then demonstrate the potential of the modelling framework to derive digital elevation data based on tidal model attribution, validating our models against in-situ GPS observations, before discussing issues that must be addressed to move this capability to a continental scale. The ability of the model to examine coastal stability is introduced, in the context of the conceptual reframing of the data into the tidal domain, with a view to furthering this application in future versions of the model.

AB In the context of complex demands on forest resources and climate change, synoptic and spatially-explicit base-line data characterizing national trends in forest disturbance and subsequent return of vegetation (and eventual return to forest) are increasingly required. Time series analyses of remotely sensed data enable the retrospective generation of baseline data depicting both forest disturbance and recovery, enabling a more holistic examination of forest dynamics. In this research, we utilize the outputs of the Composite2Change, or C2C, algorithm that lever-ages the extensive Landsat archive to produce annual, gap-free, surface reflectance composites to date and label disturbance types and to characterize vegetation recovery over the >650 million ha of Canada's forested ecosystems. From 1985 to 2010, 57.5 Mha or 10.75% of Canada's net forested ecosystem area (exclusive of water) were disturbed by either wildfire or harvest, representing an annual rate of disturbance of approximately 0.43% per year. Wildfire accounted for 2.5 times more area disturbed than harvest. On average, wildfire disturbed 1.6 Mha annually and had greater inter-annual variability with a standard deviation of 1.1 Mha, compared to the 0.65 Mha disturbed annually by harvesting (sigma = 0.1 Mha). Herein, we defined a longer-term measure of spectral recovery (the number of years it took for a pixel to attain 80% of its pre-disturbance Normalized Burn Ratio or NBR value), which indicated that harvested areas are recovering more consistently over time relative to areas disturbed by wildfire, with 78.6% of harvested areas requiring <= 10 years to recover, compared to only 35.5% of wildfire areas. A shorter-term (5-year) measure of spectral recovery, also based on the NBR, indicated that vegetation in wildfire areas returned more rapidly than harvested areas; however, when the magnitude of the disturbance was incorporated into the metric, with magnitude typically larger and more variable for wildfire areas, harvested areas were found to be recovering more rapidly on average in the short-term. Overall, < 1% of the areas disturbed by wildfire and harvest were identified as non-recovering by all three spectral measures of recovery used in our analysis. Regionally, trends in disturbance and recovery largely echoed trends found at the national level, although the relative amounts and rates of wildfire or harvest varied by ecozone. Time series Landsat composites provide an opportunity to characterize relative trends in disturbance and recovery at a national scale, by disturbance type and ecozone, in a spatially explicit manner and at a level of spatial detail that is relevant to both forest management and science.

AB Changes in global climate drivers have multiple impacts on lake ecosystems, as rain and wind conditions control catchment surface runoff and lake mixing regimes. However, human activities in lakes and their watersheds may have direct and indirect impacts on aquatic optical properties. Therefore, identifying key drivers that can be controlled (human) from those that cannot (climate) represents an important objective. In the present study, we develop an algorithm to estimate the concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in Lake Hongze (the fourth largest freshwater lake in China) using MODIS/Aqua images with concurrent data collected from six cruise surveys. The algorithm resulted in root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 7.64-7.86 mg/L for SPM ranging from 10 to 80 mg/L. The algorithm was applied to 1602 cloud-free MODIS/Aqua images from 2002 to 2015. Our results show: (1) inter-annual and seasonal variations of SPM concentrations in lake Hongze are divided into two distinct periods between 2002 and 2011 and 2012-2015, with the transition associated to intensive dredging activities that were initiated in 2012. (2) SPM concentrations exhibit four typical patterns of spatial distribution which depend on local meteorological (wind speed and wind direction) and hydrological conditions (catchment rainfall and Huai River flowrate). Based on these results, a new spatial zoning of the lake is derived to support government and agency monitoring. The study shows additive and synergistic effects of climate change and human activities on SPM concentrations over short and long timescales and the possibility to monitor these changes by remote sensing in shallow optically complex lakes.

AB Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are two very potent greenhouse gases, with highly heterogeneous distributions in both space and time. Mapping hot-spots and source areas, and measuring fluxes in different environments has so far not been possible on a local scale using direct measurements. We have developed a method for simultaneous mapping of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), also including water vapor (H2O), using ground-based remote sensing on a landscape-sized scale by utilizing Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometers (IFTS) with high spectral resolution and imaging rates. The approach uses calculated libraries of transmission spectra at the spectroscopic resolutions of the IFTS, based on the HITRAN database of spectroscopic lines and our own line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM). For each species, 1024 spectra have been made, resulting in 10243 combinations of column densities. Using an adaptive grid, solutions are found for each line of sight at a spectral resolution of up to 0.25 cm(-1) using the full spectral region of the detector. The modeling is multi-layered, calculating temperatures of the background, air, and any additional gas layers, also accounting for reflected cold sky. Background distances can be mapped from the amount of water vapor in each line of sight. The described approach can be used to identify sources, quantify gas distributions, and to calculate fluxes. Visualizations can produce gas distribution images, as well as air motion videos, which are used to map fluxes using the same data set, without the need for additional instruments for wind measurements.

A conventional decision tree algorithm with multiple threshold tests was employed to analyze radiances for the five spectral bands available across the full analysis period. The accuracies of the analyzed SCE maps were evaluated against in-situ snow data measured at ground stations along with the SCE maps from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Data Record (NOAA-CDR) product. The evaluation showed the JASMES product to have a more temporally stable producer's accuracy (PA; 1-omission error) than NOAA, which is a key factor in the analysis of long-term SCE trends. Comparison of seasonal NH SCE trends from the two products showed NOAA to have opposite trends to those of JASMES in the fall and winter seasons, and to have overestimated SCE decreasing trends in the spring and summer. These tendencies are consistent with the increasing spatial and temporal resolutions of information over time, which were used in generating the NOAA snow analysis. An estimation of unbiased SCEs based on the accuracies of SCE maps also endorses the long-term trends of the JASMES product The JASMES NH seasonal SCE exhibited negative slopes in all seasons but was only statistically significant in the summer (JJA) and fall (SON). Delayed snow cover onset was observed to be the main driver of decreasing annual snow duration (SCD) trends. The spatial pattern of annual SCD trends exhibited noticeable asymmetry between continents, with the largest significant decreases observed over western Eurasia with relatively few statistically significant decreases over North America.

AB Satellite-derived land surface temperature (skin temperature) provides invaluable information for data-sparse high elevation and Arctic regions. However, the relationship between satellite-derived clear-sky skin temperature and various downscaled air temperature products for snow covered sub-Arctic alpine regions remain poorly understood, such that trend analysis or air temperature product integration is difficult. We compared monthly average air temperatures from two independent downscaled temperature products to MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) and air temperature at nine meteorological stations situated above tree-line in the southwest Yukon, Canada, between May and August 2008 for a full range of snow cover fractions. We found that both down scaled products generally agreed with LST for the low elevation, snow-free, vegetation classes. However, a systematic cold bias in Average LST emerged for snow fractions greater than approximately 40%, and this bias increased in magnitude as snow cover increased. In these situations the downscaled air temperatures were 57 degrees C warmer than Average LST for snow fractions of >90%, and this pattern was largely independent of the number of measurements of LST within a month. Maximum LST was similar to average air temperatures for high snow fractions, but Minimum LST was colder by 10 degrees C or more for all snow fractions. Consequently, the average of Maximum and Minimum LST produces the cold bias, compared to air temperature, for high snow cover fractions. Air temperature measured at nine meteorological monitoring stations located between elevations of 1408-2690 m, on land cover classes Barren, Sparsely Vegetated or Permanent Snow and Ice, confirmed the cold bias results when incorporating Minimum LST in monthly averages. For snow fractions of <40% the RMSE for all of the temperature products was <2.5 degrees C when compared to station air temperature and all biases were positive and <2.0 degrees C. For snow fractions of >40%, the average LST bias became strongly negative at -4.5 degrees C, and the RMSE increased to 6.1 degrees C, whereas the downscaled products bias and RMSE were similar to those from snow fractions of <40%. A weak warm bias for all the temperature products occurred for small snow fractions over non-forested land cover classes. Downscaled air temperature fields show physically real differences from Average LST in spring and summer, caused by snow cover and the interplay of Maximum and Minimum LST. These findings indicate that the integration of MODIS 1ST with downscaled air temperature products or local air temperature requires the incorporation of snow cover. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Measurements of land surface temperature (LST) performed in the thermal infrared (TIR) domain are prone to strong directional anisotropy. Instead of detailed analytical physical TIR models requiring too much input information and computational capacities, simplified parametric approaches capable to mimic and correct with precision the angular effects on 1ST will be deemed suitable for practical satellite applications. In this study, we present a simple two parameters model, so-called RL (Roujean-Lagouarde), which shows capabilities to properly depict the directional signatures of both urban and vegetation targets within an accuracy better than 1 degrees C This latter value is the RMSE (root mean square error) obtained as the best adjustment of the RL model against in situ datasets. Then the RL approach was compared to a synthetic dataset generated by the model Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) in which large variability in meteorological scenarios, canopy structure and water status conditions was accounted for. Results indicate RMSE <= 0.6 degrees C which is a very hopeful result. Besides, the RL model performs even better than the popular parametric model of Vinnikov that encompasses two unknowns. The ability of RL model to better reproduce the hotspot phenomenon explains this feature.
   The RL model appears as a potential candidate for future operational processing chains of TIR satellite data because it fulfills the requirements of both simple analytical formulation and limited number of input parameters. Efforts nevertheless remain to be done on inversion methodologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Shortwave surface albedo of the Arctic sea-ice zone is one of the most important parameters in the surface energy budget over the northern hemispheric cryosphere. Although many global and regional broadband surface albedo products have been generated from satellite observations, most of them contain albedo over land-surfaces only, and the albedo over ocean and sea-ice surfaces is usually left blank or estimated based on the lambertian-assumption. In this paper, we extend the BRDF-based direct-estimation algorithm for mapping the shortwave surface albedo of the Arctic sea-ice zone with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Firstly, a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) database for sea ice was generated based on simulations of the asymptotic radiative transfer (ART) and the three components ocean water albedo (TCOWA) model. Secondly, a linear regression relationship between top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and surface broadband albedo was developed for different angular bins. Finally, the direct-estimation coefficients derived by the angular bin regression were stored in a pre-calculated look up table (LUT). When the MODIS LIB swath data are available, the corresponding coefficients are searched based on the solar/view geometry. Therefore, the shortwave surface albedo can be estimated from single-angular observations. Compared with the in situ measurements from the Tara polar ocean expedition in 2007, the results indicate that the.albedo estimated by the BRDF-based direct-estimation algorithm has an R-2 value of 0.67 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.068. The validation results show that the BRDF-based direct-estimation algorithm is suitable for mapping shortwave surface albedo of the Arctic sea-ice zone, which corrects the reflectance anisotropic effect with prior physical BRDF database and makes it possible to generate long-term Arctic surface albedo products with higher spatial and temporal resolutions.

AB Landslide susceptibility maps (LSM) are commonly used by local authorities for land use management and planning activities, representing a valuable tool used to support decision makers in urban and infrastructural planning. The accuracy of a landslide susceptibility map is affected by false negative and false positive errors which can decrease the reliability of this useful product. In particular, false negative errors, are generally worse in terms of social and economic losses with respect to the losses associated with false positives. In this paper, we present a new technique to improve the accuracy of landslide susceptibility maps using Permanent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) data. The proposed approach uses two different data sets acquired in ascending and descending geometry. The PS velocity measured along the line of sight is re-projected into a new velocity along the steepest slope direction (V-Slope). Integration between the LSM and the ground deformation velocity map along the slope was performed using an empirical contingency matrix, which takes into account the average V-Slope and the susceptibility degree obtained using the Random Forests algorithm. The Results show that the susceptibility degree increased in 56.41 km(2) of the study area. The combination of PSInSAR data and the landslide susceptibility map (LSM) improved the prediction reliability of slow moving landslides, which particularly affect urbanized areas. The use of this procedure can be easily applied in different areas where PSI data sets are available. This approach will help planning and decision-making authorities produce reliable landslide susceptibility maps, correcting some of the LSM errors. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Accurate monitoring of climate-driven expansion of low-stature shrubs in Arctic tundra requires high-resolution maps of shrub biomass that can accurately quantify the current baseline over relevant spatial and temporal extents. In this study, our goal was to use airborne lidar and imagery to build accurate high -resolution shrub biomass maps for an important research landscape in the American Arctic. In a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis, optimized lidar-derived canopy volume was a good single predictor of harvested shrub biomass (R-2 = 0.62; RMSD = 219 g m(-2); slope = 1.08). However, model accuracy was improved by incorporating additional lidar-derived canopy metrics and airborne spectral metrics in a Random Forest regression approach (pseudo R-2 = 0.71; RMSD = 197 g m(-2): slope = 1.02). The best Random Forest model was used to map shrub biomass at 0.80 m resolution across three lidar collection footprints (similar to 12.5 km(2) total) near Toolik Field Station on Alaska's North Slope. We characterized model uncertainty by creating corresponding maps of the coefficient of variation in Random Forest shrub biomass estimates. We also explore potential benefits of incorporating lidar-derived topographic metrics, and consider tradeoffs inherent in employing different data sources for high -resolution vegetation mapping efforts. This study yielded maps that provide valuable, high -resolution spatial estimates of aboveground shrub biomass and canopy volume in a rapidly changing tundra ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Considering agricultural landscapes as networks can provide information about spatial connectivity relevant for a wide range of applications including pollination, pest management, and ecology. At global scales, spatial networks of agricultural land use inferred from land cover products are well-described by power law rank-size distributions. However, regional analyses of agricultural land use typically focus on subsets of the total global network. In this paper, we seek to address the following questions: Does the globally observed scale-free property of agricultural networks hold over smaller spatial domains? Can similar properties be observed at kilometer to meter scales? Does the observed scale-free structure persist as agricultural networks evolve over the growing season? We analyze 9 intensively cultivated Landsat scenes on 5 continents with a wide range of vegetation distributions. We find that networks of vegetation fraction within the domain of each of these Landsat scenes exhibit substantial variability - but generally still possess similar scaling properties to the global distribution of agriculture. We also find similar results when comparing Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery for 3 agricultural regions in Europe, as well as in an IKONOS image of an agricultural region of China. To illustrate an application of spatial network analysis, we show an example of network disruption. We compare two networks with similar rank-size distributions that behave differently when nodes are progressively removed. We suggest that treating agricultural land cover as spatial networks can provide a straightforward way of characterizing the connectivity and evolution of complex spatial distributions of agriculture across a wide range of landscapes and at spatial scales relevant for practical agricultural applications.

AB Time-series analysis techniques are being increasingly used to process satellite observations of volcanic gas emissions and heat flux, with the aim of identifying cyclic behaviour that could inform hazard assessment or elucidate volcanic processes. However, it can be difficult to distinguish cyclic variations due to geophysical processes from those that are artefacts of the observation technique. Here, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the origin of cyclicity in volcanic observations by analysing daily, global satellite measurements of volcanic SO2 loading by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and thermal infrared anomalies detected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We use a fast Fourier Transform (FFT) multi-taper method (MTM) to analyse multiple phases of activity at 32 target volcanoes, utilising measurements obtained from three NASA satellite instruments (Aura - OMI, Aqua - MODIS and Terra - MODIS), and identify a common cycle (period of similar to 2.3 days), which is not considered to be of volcanic origin. Based on the presence of this cycle in multiple satellite datasets, we attribute it to variations in viewing angle during the 16-day orbit repeat cycle of sun-synchronous satellites maintained in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). A 5-point averaging correction procedure is tested on satellite observations from Kilauea volcano, Hawaii, and is found to reduce the impact of higher frequency cycles and reveal the presence of longer-period geophysical signals. In addition to the identification of a signal common to different measurement techniques, an underlying cyclical pattern was found in the OMI SO2 observations (periods of similar to 7.9 and 32 days) generated by the OMI Row Anomaly (ORA). We conclude that identification of the presence and magnitude of non-geophysical cyclic behaviour, which can suppress natural cycles in time-series data, and implementation of appropriate corrections, is crucial for accurate interpretation of satellite observations. The use of data averaging to suppress non-geophysical cycles imposes limits on the length of natural cycles that can be confidently identified in moderate resolution satellite observations from polar-orbiting spacecraft.

AB The ICESat-2 mission will provide routine estimates of sea ice freeboard from profiles of surface heights acquired by its photon-counting lidar: the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS). In this paper, we describe and test procedures devised to separate returns of ice from open water a crucial step in the estimation of local sea levels for freeboard calculations. The two data sets used in these tests, one each from winter and summer, were acquired by a Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL) implemented to support prelaunch development of retrieval approaches. Our approach first identifies likely open water returns using surface photon and background count rates as proxy indicators of apparent surface reflectance. Since these measured rates are noisy estimates of expected reflectance, relative surface heights are used to refine the selection of the candidate sea surface samples. Results show that winter freeboard distributions are consistent with expected regional variability, and the nearly identical repeat-track freeboard distributions during summer show retrieval consistency. From coincident lidar coverage, variability of sea level samples identified in the MABEL and Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) lidar profiles are 1.6 cm and 2.6 cm, with the overall difference between the distributions at 0.00 +/- 0.15 m. This demonstrates the viability of the algorithms. The parameters used in these procedures will serve as a baseline and as a guide for understanding algorithm reliability. It is expected that they will be adjusted post-launch to reflect the on-orbit performance of ATLAS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is one of the best proxies to estimate the light use efficiency and photosynthetic activity of vegetation from remote sensing observations, especially if diurnal variations can be monitored. The calculation of PRI from leaf-level spectral reflectance measurements is unambiguous. Interpretation of the value of this index is more complicated, as it is affected by leaf structure and its carotenoid and chlorophyll content. Generally, a change in leaf-level PRI indicates a change in its photosynthetic capacity. At the scales of the canopy and beyond, various non-physiological factors modulate the leaf-level PRI signal inducing large angular and spatial variations in PRI. Specifically, previous studies have shown that within-canopy illumination variations and shadowing effects directly affect the PRI of a canopy. When observing a forest with a resolution finer than the size of a tree crown, large areas of shaded and sunlit foliage become visible. The spectral distribution of irradiance in these canopy regions is different from the average top-of-canopy irradiance used in the calculation of the canopy PRI. Thus, the leaf and canopy PRI can become decoupled. To date, no thorough analytical and empirical analysis of how the spectrally variable within-canopy light conditions cause apparent, non-physiological variation in canopy PRI has been published. In this study, we propose a new method to assess these PRI variations in structured vegetation from high spatial resolution (pixel size smaller than 1 m) imaging spectroscopy data. We used airborne imaging spectroscopy of boreal forest stands to evaluate the spectral irradiance in different locations inside the canopy and calculated a correction term for the canopy PRI estimates defined using top-of-canopy irradiance. We determined the maximum value of the correction term by sampling the most sunlit and shaded road surface locations adjacent to tree crowns. Results indicated that under the particular illumination view geometry, irradiance variations decreased the canopy PRI by as much as 0.06 (relative change >100%). The correction depended only slightly on atmospheric correction parameters. Finally, we reduced the illumination-related apparent variation in canopy PRI using the two-leaf canopy photosynthesis modeling scheme, canopy shadow fraction and the maximum correction term. In a test scene, the average illumination-corrected PRI was 0.027 smaller than non-corrected canopy PRI and showed no correlation with the shadow fraction, indicating a lack of down-regulation at the time of measurement. In theory, approach can be applied to all canopy level PRI measurements from towers, aircrafts and satellites under any observation geometry. However, further validation, preferably using in situ leaf reflectance data from different biomes, would be required before the algorithm can be routinely applied. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Aerosol distribution at global and regional scales is one of the crucial parameters for climate change assessment. The study presents global spatio-temporal variations in aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) sensors at spatial resolutions of 1 degrees x 1 degrees and 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees respectively. Spatial correlations between MODIS and MISR AOD are reported on annual scale. The entire globe is divided into six sub-regions, i.e., North-West, North, North-East, South-West, South and South-East. The annual and seasonal mean AOD variations are obtained by analyzing Level 3 monthly datasets for the period 2001-2014. Relative changes (%) in AOD between the first and last seven years (i.e. 2001-2007 and 2008-2014 respectively) are discussed at annual and seasonal levels. AOD trends are calculated using the weighted least squares regression approach and weights are assigned to the AOD values corresponding to the expected errors. Statistically significant trends are reported at 95% confidence level. The results inferred from both the sensors are found to be in quite acceptable agreement. Increasing trends are found in the economically growing parts of Asian landmass and the surrounding oceanic regions, especially Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal. On the other hand, decreasing trends are observed over parts of Europe, South America and North America. The study also focuses on examining the AOD trends over the ten most populous nations of the world. In terms of aerosol loadings, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nigeria turned out to be the most polluted amongst the most populous countries. Significantly increasing trends in AOD are reported over the Indian subcontinent. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the comparison of three global soil moisture products (ASCAT, AMSR and SMOS) versus a. land surface model over a region representative of several Mediterranean landscapes located in the Northeast of the Iberian Peninsula. Our approach has been for agricultural and water management applications at the regional and local scale. Despite being a rather small area, we were able to observe different signal behaviours corresponding to major land cover classes in Mediterranean areas i.e.: dryland and irrigated crops, forests and natural vegetation (grass-shrubs). The area also allowed assessing the impact of topography. The first result of the study is that the results are very dependent on the normalizations used to make the data comparable, thus their impact must be carefully analysed. In this study, we applied two different normalisation methods (called ZV35 and ZV) and different moving average windows (1, 10 and 30 days) in order to enhance seasonal effects. Using no smoothing window, ASCAT is the soil moisture product that correlates best with the LSM over all cover classes, whatever the method. Using smoothing window, AMSR-E tends to outperform other soil moisture products with the ZV method. The ZV35 method is not able to identify a small heavily irrigated area. The reason for these different results is that ZV35, tends to eliminate the monthly scale soil moisture memory and therefore becomes more sensitive to precipitation and less sensitive to the monthly evolution of superficial soil moisture. The comparison shows in general good agreement for all soil moisture products with the LSM on the temporal series simulated over flat, non irrigated areas which are not close to the sea. SMOS has difficulties in areas close to the sea and in areas with steep relief and the current version of the L2 Operational Algorithm (V5.51) depicts few values in forested areas. ASCAT, in its turn, shows some limitations over agricultural and natural vegetation where it shows an increase of soil moisture from June to October probably due to increase of penetration depth in dry soil moisture conditions. AMSR-E LPRM shows a clear vegetation cycle over all the land cover classes. From all the remote sensing products, SMOS is the only one able to see irrigation and the only that does not show clear vegetation or roughness effects. In this study, we were able to assess the impact of higher resolution soil moisture products to map irrigated areas. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In archaeological remote sensing, space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has not been used so far to monitor 'looting' (i.e. illegal excavations in heritage sites) mainly because of the spatial resolution of SAR images, typically not comparable to the ground dimensions of looting features. This paper explores the potential of the new TerraSAR-X beam mode Staring Spotlight (ST) to investigate looting within a workflow of radar backscattering change detection. A bespoke time series of five single polarisation, ascending mode, ST scenes with an unprecedented azimuth resolution of 0.24 m was acquired over the archaeological site of Apamea in western Syria, from October 2014 to June 2015 with a regular sampling of one image every two months. Formerly included in the Tentative List of UNESCO, the site has been heavily looted from at least early 2012 to May 2014, as confirmed by Google Earth Very High Resolution (VHR) optical imagery. Building upon the theory of SAR imaging, we develop a novel conceptual model of 'looting marks', identify marks due to occurrence of new looting and discriminate them from alteration (e.g. filling) of pre-existing looting holes. 'Looting marks' appear as distinctive patterns of shadow and layover which are visible in the ground-range reprojected ST image and generated by the morphology of the holes. The recognition of looting marks within ratio maps of radar backscatter (sigma(0)) between consecutive ST scenes allows quantification of the magnitude, spatial distribution and rates of looting activities. In agreement with the estimates based on Google Earth imagery, the ST acquired in October 2014 shows that similar to 45% of the site was looted. In the following eight months new looting happened locally, with holes mainly dug along the margins of the already looted areas. Texture values of similar to 0.31 clearly distinguish these holes from the unaltered, bare ground nearby. Hot spots of change are identified based on the temporal variability sigma(0), and colour composites indicate where repeated looting and alteration of existing holes occurred. Most looting marks are observed north of the two main Roman decumani. Looting intensified almost steadily from December 2014, with over 1500 new marks in February-April 2015. The estimated rates of looting increased from 214 looting marks/month in October-December 2014 to over 780 marks/month in April June 2015, and numerically express the dynamic nature of the phenomenon to which Apamea is still exposed. The method of identifying looting marks in VHR radar images therefore proves a reliable opportunity for archaeologists and image analysts to measure remotely the scale of looting and monitor its temporal evolution.

AB The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) technique is a popular method for producing spatially contiguous predictions of forest attributes by combining field and remotely sensed data. In the framework of Working Group 2 of COST Action FP1001, we reviewed the scientific literature for forestry applications of k-NN. Information available in scientific publications on this topic was used to populate a database that was then used as the basis for a meta analysis. We extracted qualitative and quantitative information from 260 experimental tests described in 148 scientific papers. The papers represented a geographic range of 26 countries and a temporal range from 1981 to 2013. Firstly, we describe the literature search and the information extracted and analyzed. Secondly, we report the results of the meta-analysis, especially with respect to estimation accuracies reported for k-NN applications for different configurations, different forest environments, and different input information. We also provide a summary of results that may reasonably be expected for those planning a k-NN application using remotely sensed data from different sensors and for different forest attributes. Finally, we identify some methodological publications that have advanced the state of the science with respect to k-NN. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Landsat data were used to assess urbanization-induced dynamics in Land use/cover (LULC), surface thermal intensity, and its relationships with urban biophysical composition. The study was undertaken in Addis Ababa city, Ethiopia. Ground-based data and high resolution images were used as reference data in LULC classification. To more accurately quantify landscape patterns and their changes, we applied new locally optimized separability enhancement indices and decision rules (SEI-DR approach) to address commonly observed classification accuracy problems in urban environments. We tested the SEI-DR approach using eight Landsat images acquired between 1985 and 2010. Two approaches were applied to quantify surface heat intensity (SHIn) and to examine its spatial patterns over 25 years: thermal gradient analysis and hot spot analysis. A Simultaneous Autoregressive Spatial error model (SARerr) was used to explore relationships between surface temperature and biophysical variables describing urban surfaces. Compared to Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, accuracy improvement achieved through use of the SEI-DR procedure was, respectively, 6% and 5% and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The Surface Heat Intensity (SHIn) analysis showed increasing contrast (1985-2010) between urban centers and the outskirt. On average, outskirts were cooler than central urban areas by up to 3.7 degrees C. We detected statistically significant differences in intra-urban thermal aggregation (P < 0.01) and the differences ranged from 4.4 degrees C to 5.3 degrees C. Increasing heat intensity was observed between 1985 and 2010. However, we observed no clear evidence of urban areas being warmer than rural. Built-up surfaces and bare soil showed similar positive relationships with surface temperature (P < 0.01), while vegetation showed a negative relationship (P < 0.05). We conclude that with rapid urbanization, thermal intensity increased but relationships with vegetation suggest that options for mitigating urban warming in tropical climates may be available. The development of a new urban classification method, use of hotspot analysis, and the investigations of the UHI for an African city fill important research gaps for studies of urban thermal variation.

AB Automating the accurate classification of water in Landsat imagery will benefit many researchers conducting large-area multi-temporal analyses of the USGS archive. We propose that water index methods based on data normalised to surface reflectance, using thresholds optimised for a large selection of data, provide a simple yet accurate method for automated water classification across large regions. In order to select the best index for this task a comprehensive comparative analyses was required. We assessed the accuracy of seven water index methods for classifying water in 30 m resolution Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI imagery from eastern Australia. These indexes were the Automated Water Extraction Index for images with shadows (AWEI(shadow)) and without shadows (AWEI(no shadow)), tasselled cap wetness (TCWcrist), two variations of the normalised difference water index (NDWIMcFeeters and NDWIXu), a water index created using canonical variates analysis from top-of atmosphere data (WI2006), and a new water index created with linear discriminant analysis from data processed to surface reflectance (WI2015). A wide variety of water (50,868), non-water (36,833) and mixed (16,499) validation pixels were selected from Landsat images across the states of New South Wales and Queensland. Water area and the colour of water and non-water features were determined for each validation pixel using coincident high resolution imagery and TM/ETM+ reflectance. A single optimum threshold for classifying each index into water and non-water was determined using pure pixels. In general the WI2015, WI2006 and AWEI(shadow) performed the best, with all indexes achieving overall accuracies of 95-99% for pure pixels, and 73-75% for mixed pixels. Omission errors were more common than commission errors, and water area was usually underestimated, especially where water was green-brown in colour, and/or where water bodies were small or had long perimeters with many mixed pixels. The accuracy of each index was highly dependent on the composition of the validation pixels, with no index performing best across all water and non-water pixel types. All indexes and thresholds were found to perform consistently across images from the TM, ETM + and OLI sensors, facilitating the automated classification of water to similar levels of accuracy for the growing archive of Landsat data.

AB Offshore oil and gas platforms are rapidly expanding worldwide to meet the growing demand for energy, and up-to-date knowledge of their number and spatial distribution is essential for management and safety maintenance of the marine environment. However, information on the distribution of these platforms over vast areas of the sea is extremely poor partly because of business secrecy, national interests including security, and partly from bureaucratic inertia. Until recently, the automatic and accurate identification of platforms using optical imagery was challenging due to their subtle characteristics (i.e., low contrast and small size) and prevalent cloud cover. The Landsat-8 satellite, with its increasing Operational Land Imager (OLI) dataset with uniform quality and global coverage, may assist researchers in assessing the worldwide distribution of offshore platforms. Here we describe an automated method, based on time-series of OLI imagery, for extracting offshore platforms (AMEOP) which addresses the aforementioned problems. Specifically, two strategies (time-series and multi-refinement) were designed to address the challenges presented by heavy cloud cover over the sea. Three features documented in the OLI imagery time-series (contextual feature, and position- and size-invariance) were used to accurately discriminate offshore platforms from false positives. The AMEOP was applied to the Gulf of Thailand and 370 offshore platforms were automatically identified using 198 OLI images. Validation using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images and Chinese high-resolution satellite imagery demonstrated an omission error of 3.8% and a commission error below 1.0%. The AMEOP was also successfully extended to the Persian Gulf and northern Gulf of Mexico, 2346 and 2411 offshore platforms were respectively identified. We believe that the methodology presented herein provides a robust and cost-effective technique for improving the identification of offshore platforms over large areas of the sea; and that the accumulation of OLI data, together with the SAR images, has great potential for mapping and tracking of offshore platforms on a global scale, as well as for providing an early warning of oil spills around platforms and the improved estimation of their greenhouse gas emissions.

AB Air pollution in the form of fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, can decrease human life expectancy and increase the overall mortality rate. Based on a time series of remotely sensed PM2.5 concentrations, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of this crucial pollutant in China from 1999 to 2011 using trend analysis and standard deviation ellipse analysis, and carried out a health risk assessment of human exposure to PM2.5. The results showed that PM2.5 concentrations increased significantly from 1999 to 2011 in China, especially in the central and eastern parts of the country. The proportion of areas with PM2.5 concentrations higher than 35 mu g/m(3) increased year by year, and the areas with PM2.5 concentrations lower than the annual primary standard of 15 mu g/m(3) decreased continuously. The areas most polluted by PM2.5 were south of Hebei, north of Henan and west of Shandong provinces, with changes in the overall spatial distribution of the pollutant occurring faster along a south-north axis than along an east-west axis, and also faster along an east-south axis than along a west-north axis. Based on the PM2.5 concentrations in China from 1999 to 2011, a two-tier standard (level-I and level-II) was proposed for delineated areas to assist in nationwide air pollution control. It was also found that the proportion of the population exposed to PM2.5 concentrations greater than 35 mu g/m(3) increased year by year, and increased faster than the proportion of population exposed to PM2.5 concentrations in the range 15-35 mu g/m(3). The health risk in the central and eastern areas of the country was the highest. Based on these results, PM2.5 pollution poses an increasingly serious risk to human health across China and there is an immediate need to implement its regional control. In addition, more attention should be paid at the national scale in terms of pollution risk, rather than focusing narrowly on a city scale. (C). 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remotely sensed data that are sensitive to rapidly changing plant physiology can provide real-time information about crop responses to abiotic conditions. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has shown promise when measured at short timesteps to remotely estimate dynamics in xanthophyll pigment interconversion a plant photoprotective mechanism that results in lowered photosynthetic efficiency. To gain a better understanding of this dynamic spectral response to environmental conditions, we investigated PRI over two seasons (2013 and 2014) in rainfed soft white spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Highly temporally resolved (measurement frequency = five minutes) in-situ radiometric measurements of PRI were collected at field plots of varying nitrogen (N) and soil water conditions (n = 16). To represent the diurnal magnitude of xanthophyll pigment inter conversion, we use a delta PRI (Delta PRI) derived from a midday PRI (xanthophyll de-epoxidation state) and an early morning PRI (xanthophyll epoxidation state). We hypothesize that Delta PRI can empirically deconvolve the diurnally changing (facultative) from the seasonally changing (constitutive) component of the PRI signal. In this study, Delta PRI demonstrated less sensitivity than an uncorrected PRI to leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content throughout the growing season. Delta PRI! was correlated with continuous, unattended crop responses associated with vapor pressure deficit (0.50 > R-2 > 0.48), stomatal conductance (R-2 = 0.47), and air temperature (0.42 > R-2 > 35). Further, the sensitivity with which Delta PRI responded to solar radiation under varying N treatments and periods of soil water availability (surplus, depletion, and deficit) suggests that crop growth may be inhibited by a xanthophyll cycle mediated stress response, detectable by Delta PRI A major implication of these findings is that highly temporally and spatially resolved Delta PRI data could be used to track plant status in response to changing environmental conditions.

AB Satellite imagery is increasingly used to monitor glacier area changes and create glacier inventories. Robust and efficient pixel-based band ratios have proven to be accurate for automatically delineating clean glacier ice, however such classifications are restricted on debris-covered ice due to its spectral similarity with surrounding terrain. Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) has emerged as a new analysis technique within remote sensing. It offers many advantages over pixel-based classification techniques due to the ability to work with multiple data sources and handle data contextually and hierarchically. By making use of OBIA capabilities we automatically classify dean ice and debris-covered ice in the challenging area surrounding Mount Manaslu in Nepal using optical (Landsat 8), topographic (void-filled SRTM) and SAR coherence (ALOS PALSAR) data. Clean ice was classified with a mean accuracy of 93% whilst debris-covered ice was classified with an accuracy of 83% when compared to manually corrected outlines, providing a total glacier accuracy of 91%. With further developments in the classification, steep tributary sections of ice could be contextually included, raising the accuracy to over 94%. One prominent advantage of OBIA is that it allows some post-processing and correction of the glacier outlines automatically, reducing the amount of manual correction needed. OBIA incorporating SAR coherence data is recommended for future mapping of debris-covered ice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Large brown seaweeds (kelps) form forests in temperate and boreal marine systems that serve as foundations to the structure and dynamics of communities. Mapping the distributions of these species is important to understanding the ecology of coastal environments, managing marine ecosystems (e.g., spatial planning), predicting consequences of climate change and the potential for carbon production. We demonstrate how combining seafloor mapping technologies (LiDAR and multibeam bathymetry) and models of wave energy to map the distribution and relative abundance of seaweed forests of Ecklonia radiata can provide complete coverage over hundreds of square kilometers. Using generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), we associated observations of E. radiata abundance from video transects with environmental variables. These relationships were then used to predict the distribution of E. radiata across our 756.1 km(2) study area off the coast of Victoria, Australia. A reserved dataset was used to test the accuracy of these predictions. We found that the abundance distribution of E. radiata is strongly associated with depth, presence of rocky reef, curvature of the reef topography, and wave exposure. In addition, the GLMM methodology allowed us to adequately account for spatial autocorrelation in our sampling methods. The predictive distribution map created from the best GLMM predicted the abundance of E. radiata with an accuracy of 72%. The combination of LiDAR and multibeam bathymetry allowed us to model and predict E. radiata abundance distribution across its entire depth range for this study area. Using methods like those presented in this study, we can map the distribution of macroalgae species, which will give insight into ecological communities, biodiversity distribution, carbon uptake, and potential sequestration.

   Bay; Global change
ID RETRIEVAL; SEA; IMPACT
AB Water temperature is a key factor used to assess biogeochemical cycles and aquatic habitat quality, and is typically monitored using in situ sensors deployed on distributed piers, buoys or mobile platforms. Due to multiple, spatially and temporally varying influences on surface water temperature, (e.g., solar radiation, water depth, tidal stage, turbidity, and industrial activities) multi-temporal remote sensing observations might effectively be used to link these drivers with observations. However, while low- to moderate-resolution sensors provide temporally continuous observations, large pixel sizes have proven problematic in coastal regions where shoreline influences on pixel radiance contaminate the radiation signal leaving the water surface. To alleviate this problem, we used a dense stack of Landsat TM/ETM+ thermal imagery organized by day of year of acquisition, thus producing a climatology of water temperature. We use these data to analyze the spatial patterns of water surface temperature climatology (e.g., average maximum and minimum temperatures) for the past thirty years. We also explore the impact of power plant thermal effluent on water surface temperature climatology of the Chesapeake Bay tributaries. Finally, we divide the Landsat record into 5-year intervals, and calculate the water surface temperature climatology for each period. Trends in water surface temperature over the Landsat record were then compared against air temperature records available from coastal NOAA weather stations. The resulting data exhibit broad scale patterns, such as water surface climatology differences between the main stem of the Bay and its tributaries. The results also include the influence of urbanization and industrialization such as increases in impervious surface area and thermal effluent from power plants. Trends of increasing water surface temperature and air temperature were found for more than 92% of the Bay. While water temperature was always similar to 2-3 degrees cooler than the air temperature, water temperature has been increasing more rapidly than air temperature in some areas, particularly in the main stem of the Bay and in the Potomac estuary. Therefore, there is a detectable impact of global change on the Chesapeake Bay in the form of an increase in water temperature, which can only partially be explained by increasing air temperatures.

AB We propose a methodology using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis and a single GPS station to estimate the coseismic and postseismic crustal deformations in the Kanto region, Japan, which has been affected by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The proposed methodology depends on choosing a proper deformation trend(s) to accurately describe the earthquake deformation signature by studying the deformation time series of a single GPS station. The modeled deformation trend is subtracted from the unwrapped phase maps to separate the main deformation signature from the imposed errors. Some deformation components, not described by the model(s), will leak to the residual phase maps which will be subjected to temporal and spatial filtering. The final corrected unwrapped phase maps are estimated by restoring the modeled deformation trend to the filtered residual phase maps and finally the deformation time series is estimated using a least squares technique. The proposed methodology was designed to retrieve complex and fine surface deformations in areas that have been affected by large dominating deformation signatures and contain at a least single GPS station. The methodology was tested using Envisat-ASAR C-band images and validation was carried out using GPS stations resulting in a mean RMS error of 6.9 mm. The estimated deformation time series shows a differential postseismic deformation pattern that can be attributed to an off Boso peninsula motion triggered by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake.

AB The Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) is a proposed satellite mission that combines a 60 m spatial resolution Visible-Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer and a 60 m multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) scanner. HyspIRI would combine the established capability of a VSWIR sensor to discriminate plant species and estimate accurate cover fractions with improved Land Surface Temperatures (LST) retrieved from the TIR sensor. We evaluate potential synergies between Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) maps of dominant plant species and mixed species assemblages, fractional cover, and MODIS/ASTER Airborne Simulator (MASTER) LST utilizing multiple flight lines acquired in July 2011 in the Santa Barbara, California area. Species composition and green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), impervious, and soil cover fractions were mapped using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis with a spectral library derived from 7.5 m imagery. Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) was accomplished using the MASTER TES algorithm. Pixel-based accuracy exceeded 50% for 23 species and land cover classes and approached 75% based on pixel majority in reference polygons. An inverse relationship was observed between CV fractions and LST. This relationship varied by dominant plant species/vegetation class, generating unique LST GV clusters. We hypothesize clustering is a product of environmental controls on species distributions, such as slope, aspect, and elevation as well as species-level differences in canopy structure, rooting depth, water use efficiency, and available soil moisture, suggesting that relationships between LST and plant species will vary seasonally. The potential of HyspIRI as a means of providing these seasonal relationships is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Imaging spectroscopy has been used successfully to map species across diverse ecosystems, and with several spaceborne imaging spectrometer missions underway (e.g., Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP)), these data may soon be available globally. Still, most studies have focused only on single ecosystems, and many different classification strategies have been used, making it difficult to assess the potential for mapping dominant species on a broader scale. Here we compare a number of classification approaches across five contrasting ecosystems containing an expansive diversity of species and plant functional types in an effort to find a robust strategy for discriminating among dominant plant species within and across ecosystems. We evaluated the performance of combinations of methods of training data selection (stratified random selection and iterative endmember selection (IES)), spectral dimension reduction methods (canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) and partial least squares regression (PLSR)) and classification algorithms (linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA)). Accuracy was assessed using an independent validation data set. Mean kappa coefficients for all strategies ranged from 0.48 to 0.85 for each ecosystem. Maximum kappa values and overall accuracies within each ecosystem ranged from 056 to 0.90 and 61-92%, respectively. Our findings show that both LDA and MESMA are able to discriminate among species to a high degree of accuracy in most ecosystems, with LDA performing slightly better. Spectral dimension reduction generally improved these results, particularly in conjunction with MESMA. Within each ecosystem, both the number and identities of functional types present, as well as the spatial distribution of dominant species, played a strong role in classification accuracy. In a pooled ecosystem classification, using CDA and LDA, we discriminated among 65 classes with an overall accuracy of 70% for the validation library, using only a 6% training sample. Our results suggest that a spaceborne imaging spectrometer such as HyspIRI will be able to map dominant plant species on a broader scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The elevated surface and air temperatures of urban environments can influence the timing of vegetation growth dynamics within and across city boundaries. We examined patterns of land surface phenology (LSP) throughout the U.S. Great Plains region, which contains diverse metropolitan areas embedded within a predominately agricultural landscape. We assembled a time series (2002-2012) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data and land surface temperature data at 500 m and 1000 m spatial resolution, respectively. We derived measures of the vegetated land surface and the thermal regime of the growing season at 8-day intervals using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Accumulated Growing Degree-Days (AGDD). Fitting the convex quadratic LSP model of NDVI as a function of AGDD yielded two phenometrics - Peak NDVI and Thermal Time to Peak - and one model fit metric - the adjusted coefficient of determination (r(adj)(2)) - for each pixel per growing season. We linked the phenometrics with impervious surface area (ISA) data extracted from the U.S. Geological Survey National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) to characterize differences in timing and amplitude of peak greenness between urban areas and their surrounding landscapes. Our results reveal the broad control of climatic conditions and moisture availability on phenological patterns across urban to rural gradients, with drier, southern cities displaying more varied responses of peak greenness timing and amplitude to urban intensity.

AB Coastal wetland ecosystems are among the most productive yet highly threatened systems in the world, and population growth and increasing economic development have resulted to extremely rapid degradation and loss of coastal wetlands. Spacebome differential Interferometry SAR has proven a remarkable potential in wetland applications, including water level monitoring in high spatial resolution. However, due to the absence of ground observations for calibration and validation, long term monitoring of water depth, which is essential to evaluate ecosystem health of wetlands, is difficult to be estimated from spacebome InSAR data. We present a new differential synthetic aperture radar method for temporal evolution of water depth in wetlands. The presented technique is based on distributed scatter interferogram technique in order to provide a spatially dense hydrological observation for coastal wetlands, which are characterized by high temporal decorrelation. This method adapts a strategy by forming optimum interferogram network to get a balance between maximum interferometric information preservation and computational cost reduction, and implements spatial adaptive filtering to reduce noise and enhance fringe visibility on distributed scatterers. Refined InSAR observation is tied to absolute reference frame to generate long term high resolution water level time-series using stage data. We transform water level time-series to long term observation of water depth with assistance of a dense measurement network of water depth. We present water depth time-series obtained using the data acquired from 2007 to 2010 by the ALOS satellite, which supplied significant information to evaluate ecological performance of wetland restoration in the Yellow River Delta.

AB We present a Bayesian image classification scheme for discriminating cloud, clear and sea-ice observations at high latitudes to improve identification of areas of clear-sky over ice-free ocean for SST retrieval. We validate the image classification against a manually classified dataset using Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) data. A three-way classification scheme using a near-infrared textural feature improves classifier accuracy by 9.9% over the nadir only version of the cloud clearing used in the ATSR Reprocessing for Climate (ARC) project in high latitude regions. The three-way classification gives similar numbers of cloud and ice scenes misclassified as clear but significantly more clear-sky cases are correctly identified (89.9% compared with 65% for ARC). We also demonstrate the potential of a Bayesian image classifier including information from the 0.6 mu m channel to be used in sea-ice extent and ice surface temperature retrieval with 77.7% of ice scenes correctly identified and an overall classifier accuracy of 96%.

AB Forest fire detection in real time from geostationary satellite is very useful for early warning intervention and monitoring in all European countries. The use of infrared sensors is a well-known technique to detect high temperature events at sub-pixel level. An end to end simulation model quantitatively linking the user requirements with the instrument design parameters has been developed and applied to the European MSG SEVIRI imagery, allowing an evaluation of the minimum and the maximum detectable active fire area and temperature and giving results in agreement with literature data. A parametric analysis as a function of the instrument Instantaneous Field Of View has also been performed in order to evaluate preliminary results for the imager foreseen to be embarked in the European MTG platform. This end-to-end model can be useful to evaluate the capability of the fire detection for other satellite infrared payloads particularly during the phase 0-A of a space project when it is necessary to understand the possible impacts of the scientific requirements on the instrument sizing.

Both methods are based on Bayesian theory and were trained using data from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) lidar onboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite. Results were evaluated by comparing to independent CALIPSO-CALIOP observations and to a one-year ground-based cloud dataset composed from five different remote sensing systems over the observation site in Cabauw in the Netherlands. In addition, results were compared to two different cloud masks; one derived from the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) sensor and one from the Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility Clouds (CMSAF), Albedo and Radiation dataset from AVHRR data (CLARA-A1). It was demonstrated that the probabilistic methods compare well with the referenced satellite datasets and for daytime conditions they provide even better performance than the reference methods. Among the two probabilistic approaches, it was found that the formulation based on a Naive Bayesian formulation (denoted PPS-Prob Naive) performed clearly superior to the formulation based on a linear summation of conditional cloud probabilities (denoted PPS-Prob SPARC) for daytime conditions. For the study based on the observations over the Cabauw site, the overall daytime Kuipers Skill Score for PPS-Prob Naive was 0.84, for PPS-Prob SPARC 0.79, for CLARA-A1 0.74 and for SEVIRI 0.66. Corresponding results for night-time conditions were less favourable for the probabilistic formulations (Kuipers Skill Score 0.74 for PPS-Prob Naive, 0.68 for PPS-Prob SPARC, 0.80 for CLARA-A1 and 0.79 for SEVIRI) but still relatively close to the reference dataset The Cabauw distribution of cloudiness occurrences in different octa categories was reproduced very closely by all methods, including the probabilistic formulations. Results based on Cabauw observations were also largely in good agreement with results deduced from comparisons with the CALIPSO-CALIOP cloud mask.
   The PPS-Prob Naive approach will be implemented in an upcoming version of the Polar Platform System (PPS) cloud software issued by the EUMETSAT Nowcasting Satellite Application Facility (NWC SAF). It will also be used in the second release of the CMSAF CLARA cloud climate data record based on historic AVHRR GAC data (to be denoted CIARA-A2). (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Urbanization is one of the most important components of global environmental change, yet most of what we know about urban areas is at the local scale. Remote sensing of urban expansion across large areas provides information on the spatial and temporal patterns of growth that are essential for understanding differences in socioeconomic and political factors that spur different forms of development, as well the social, environmental, and climatic impacts that result. However, mapping urban expansion globally is challenging: urban areas have a small footprint compared to other land cover types, their features are small, they are heterogeneous in both material composition and configuration, and the form and rates of new development are often highly variable across locations. Here we demonstrate a methodology for monitoring urban land expansion at continental to global scales using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The new method focuses on resolving the spectral and temporal ambiguities between urban/non-urban land and stable/changed areas by: (1) spatially constraining the study extent to known locations of urban land; (2) integrating multi-temporal data from multiple satellite data sources to classify c. 2010 urban extent; and (3) mapping newly built areas (2000-2010) within the 2010 urban land extent using a multi-temporal composite change detection approach based on MODIS 250 m annual maximum enhanced vegetation index (EVI). We test the method in 15 countries in East-Southeast Asia experiencing different rates and manifestations of urban expansion. A two-tiered accuracy assessment shows that the approach characterizes urban change across a variety of socioeconomic/political and ecological/climatic conditions with good accuracy (70-91% overall accuracy by country, 69-89% by biome). The 250 m EVI data not only improve the classification results, but are capable of distinguishing between change and no-change areas in urban areas. Over 80% of the error in the change detection can be related to definitional issues or error propagation, rather than algorithm error. As such, these methods hold great potential for routine monitoring of urban change, as well as for providing a consistent and up-todate dataset on urban extent and expansion for a rapidly evolving region.

AB Visible, Near-Infrared and Short Wave Infrared (VNIR/SWIR, 350-2500 nm) hyperspectral imaging spectroscopy can be used to develop maps of estimated soil properties. The performance of the estimations obtained from regression models is usually assessed with figures of merit such as the standard error of calibration, the standard error of prediction or the ratio of performance deviation. All of these parameters are estimated during the model building and validation stages to evaluate the global model performance. Beyond these global indicators, the evaluation of the uncertainty that affects predictions is a major trend in analytical chemistry and chemometrics but not yet in hyperspectral imagery. Several approximate expressions and resampling methods have been proposed to estimate the prediction uncertainty when using multivariate calibrations from laboratory spectra. Based on these propositions, this paper studies a process of mapping and analyzing the uncertainties that affect soil property predictions obtained from VNIR/SVVIR airborne data using several methods. An application to real VNIR/SVVIR airborne data of clay content was used to compare the methods. The different cases yielded insights into the sources of uncertainty and showed that uncertainty analysis can guide the user to better sampling, better calibration and ultimately better mapping.

AB Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) has been extensively used for examining long-term dynamics of the vegetated land surface and climate impacts because it provides the longest time series of global satellite measurements. However, the applications are significantly limited by the persistent presence of atmospheric contamination and snow cover in the NDVI time series. Several approaches have been developed for smoothing and fitting the time series of biweekly NDVI composites but the capabilities of depicting land surface dynamics are method dependent. Using a time series of daily EVI2 (two band enhanced vegetation index) from AVHRR long term data record (LTDR) (19821999), this study reconstructed a global dataset of spatially and temporally consistent and continuous daily vegetation index. Specifically, the EVI2 outliers were removed and missing observations were filled explicitly based on biophysical properties of vegetation growing cycles. The EVI2 temporal trajectory was then reconstructed using a hybrid piecewise logistic model which is biophysically meaningful in describing vegetation growth. Moreover, the confidence for each annual time series in each individual pixel was quantified by determining both the proportion of good quality satellite observations and the agreement index of model fitting during a vegetation growing season. Finally, verification was performed, which indicated that the reconstructed EVI2 trajectory reflects well the field observations of seasonal green vegetation cover and the flux tower measurements of interannual gross primary productivity variation.

AB This study uses 50 m spatial resolution, dual-season, HH and HV L-band ALOS/PALSAR, and HH and HV C-band RADARSAT-2 data, as well as a comprehensive set of ground reference points, to map the diverse habitats of the hydrologically variant subregions of the Pantanal by using a hierarchical object based image analysis approach. First, mean and standard deviation values of image object training sites were evaluated, and used as the basis for forming preliminary land cover class thresholds for each subregion. Then, a combination of additional refined thresholds, hierarchical rules, and a supervised nearest neighbor algorithm (eCognition Feature Space Optimization) employing several features as primary inputs (mean, standard deviation, seasonal change detection, brightness, maximum difference, area, roundness, brightness, compactness, shape index, and length/width) was utilized, resulting in the definition and classification of ten habitat classes: Forest/Woodland, Riparian Forest, Open Wood Savanna, Open Wood Savanna subject to prolonged flooding, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland, Swampy Mixed Savanna, Vazantes, and Water. This classification was achieved with an overall accuracy of 80% for the entire Pantanal. The produced habitat spatial distribution maps will provide vital information for determining refuge zones for terrestrial species, and connectivity of aquatic habitats during the dry season, as well as providing crucial baseline data to aid in monitoring changes in the region, and to help define conservation strategies for habitat in this wetland.

AB Modeling diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) is of great significance to various fields concerning land surface temperature (LST) applications. However, previous DTC model-based methods require four or more LST observations in one diurnal cycle and neglect the angular effect of remotely sensed LSTs. This research proposes a hybrid method combining a DTC model with a linear temperature mixing model to interpolate DTCs over consecutive days. We call this method the diurnal linear hybrid model (DLHM). This model treats the DTC of a mixed pixel as a weighted linear combination of the DTC of each component, which is considered invariant in the neighborhood, and then employs the multi-temporal and multi-angular LST observations of multiple pixels and the corresponding angular component fractions to formulate enough observations to retrieve the DTC parameters of each component With this method, the DTCs of the mixed pixels in the neighborhood can be reconstructed using four or fewer LST observations per day, wherein the angular effect is considered. Simulated data and actual daily MODIS acquisitions are utilized to perform DIEM, and S-VISSR-derived LSTs and another interpolation method based on a surface energy balance model (ZHAN12)are used to evaluate the model. The mean absolute differences (MADs) compared with S-VISSR/LSTs are 1.64 K in October and 2.48 K in March, while those compared with ZHAN12/LSTs are 1.13 K in October and 2.38 K in March. The neglect of atmospheric attenuation in DLHM, the angular effect, and the aberrant values of S-VISSR/LSTs are the primary sources of the biases. The atmospheric condition, surface cover, and missing data also affect the model performance. A two-endmember strategy is found to be more stable and results in a higher accuracy than a four-endmember strategy over agricultural areas. The DTCs of vegetation, moist soil, high albedo and dark impervious surfaces in the four seasons are retrieved by DLHM and inter-compared to show the relationship between DTC and environmental conditions and land surface properties. This method can be useful in modeling long time series of LSTs and has the potential for studying the urban thermal environment on a diurnal scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Four global mosaics of Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) HH and HV polarization data were generated at 25 m spatial resolution using data acquired annually from 2007 to 2010. Variability in L-band HH and HV gamma-naught (gamma(0)) for forests was observed between regions, with this attributed to differences in forest structure and vegetation/surface moisture conditions. Region-specific backscatter thresholds were therefore applied to produce from each annual mosaic, a global map of forest and non-forest cover from which maps of forest losses and gain were generated. The overall agreement with forest/non-forest assessments using the Degree Confluence Project, the Forest Resource Assessment and Google Earth images was 85%, 91% and 95% respectively. Using 2007 as a baseline, decreases of 0.040 and 0.028 dB (with a 0.006 dB 99% confidence level) were observed in the HH and HV gamma(0) respectively over the same areas suggesting a decrease in forest area and/or increased smoothing of the global surface at the L-band radar observation over the four-year period. The maps provide a new global resource for documenting the changing extent of forests and offer opportunities for quantifying historical and future dynamics through comparison with historical (1992-1998) Japanese Earth Resources Satellite (JERS-1) SAR and the forthcoming (from 2014) ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data. Four year PALSAR mosaics and the forest/non-forest data, which were generated and analyzed in this paper, are opened to the public for free downloading albeit with coarser resolutions (WWW1). Future distribution of the higher (original) resolution datasets from PALSAR as well as the ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 is planned. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For remote and inaccessible forest regions, lack of sufficient or possibly any sample data inhibits estimation and construction of confidence intervals for population parameters using familiar probability- or design-based inferential methods. Although maps based on remotely sensed data may provide information on the distribution of resources, map-based estimates are subject to classification and prediction error, and map accuracy measures do not directly inform the uncertainty of the estimates. Model-based inference does not require probability samples and when used with synthetic estimation can circumvent small or no-sample difficulties associated with probability-based inference. The study focused on estimating proportion forest area using Landsat data for a study area in Minnesota, USA, and aboveground biomass using airborne laser scanning data for a study area in Hedmark County, Norway. For both study areas, model-based inference was used to estimate the components necessary for constructing confidence intervals for population means for non-sampled areas. The estimates were compared to simple random sampling, model-assisted, and model-based estimates that would have been obtained if the areas had been sampled. All estimates were within two simple random sampling standard errors of each other, thereby illustrating the utility of model-based inference for non-sampled areas. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB With earth's surface temperature and human population both on the rise a new emphasis has been placed on monitoring changes to forested ecosystems the world over. In the United States the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program monitors the forested land base with field data collected over a permanent network of sample plots. Although these plots are visited repeatedly through time there are large temporal gaps (e.g. 5-10 years) between remeasurements such that many forest canopy disturbances go undetected. In this paper we demonstrate how Landsat time series (LTS) can help improve FIA's capacity to estimate disturbance by 1.) incorporating a new, downward looking response variable which is more sensitive to picking up change and 2.) providing historical disturbance maps which can reduce the variance of design-based estimates via post-stratification. To develop the LTS response variable a trained analyst was used to manually interpret 449 forested HA plots located in the Uinta Mountains of northern Utah, USA. This involved recording cause and timing of disturbances based on evidence gathered from a 26-year annual stack of Landsat images and an 18-year, periodically spaced set of high resolution (similar to 1 m) aerial photographs (e.g. National Aerial Image Program, NAIP and Google Earth). In general, the Landsat data captured major disturbances (e.g. harvests, fires) while the air photos allowed more detailed estimates of the number of trees impacted by recent insect outbreaks. Comparing the LTS and FIA field observations, we found that overall agreement was 73%, although when only disturbed plots were considered agreement dropped to 40%. Using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, we compared distributions of live and disturbed tree size (height and DBH) and found that when LTS and FIA both found non-stand clearing disturbance the median disturbed tree size was significantly larger than undisturbed trees, whereas no significant difference was found on plots where only FIA detected disturbance. This suggests that LTS interpretation and FIA field crews both detect upper canopy disturbances while RA crews alone add disturbances occurring at or below canopy level. The analysis also showed that plots with only LTS disturbance had a significantly greater median number of years since last FIA measurement (6 years) than plots with both FIA and LTS disturbances (2.5 years), indicating that LTS improved detection on plots which had not been field sampled for several years. Next, to gauge the impact of incorporating LTS disturbances into the FIA estimation process we calculated design-based estimates of disturbance (for the period 1995-2011) using three response populations 1.) LTS observations, 2.) FIA field observations, and 3.) Combination of FIA and LTS observations. The results showed that combining the FIA and LTS observations led to the largest and most precise (i.e. smallest percent standard error) estimates of disturbance. In fact, the estimate based on the combined observations (486,458 ha, +/-47,101) was approximately 65% more than the estimate derived solely with FIA data (294,295 ha, +/-44,242). Lastly, a Landsat forest disturbance map was developed and tested for its ability to post-stratify the design-based estimates. Based on relative efficiency (RE), we found that stratification mostly improved the estimates derived with the LTS response data. Aside from insects (RE = 1.
   26), the estimates of area affected by individual agents saw minimal gain, whereas the LTS and combined FIA + LTS estimates of total disturbance saw modest improvement, with REs of 1.43 and 1.50 respectively. Overall, our results successfully demonstrate two ways LTS can improve the completeness and precision of disturbance estimates derived from FIA inventory data. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB During the last two decades surface elevation data haven been gathered over the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) from a variety of sensor, ranging from laser altimetry to stereoscopic DEMs derived from imaging sensors. The spatio-temporal resolution, the accuracy and the spatial coverage among the data differ widely. For example, ICESat, a spacebome laser profiler, has a high temporal resolution but sparse spatial coverage which places the nearest ground track to the calving front of the Kangerlussuag Glacier in East Greenland, our study site, 30 km up stream. On the other hand, stereoscopic DEMs provide almost continuous spatial coverage, but at a lower accuracy. This is a typical scenario for many rapidly changing outlet glaciers in Greenland where a fusion of the disparate data sets is highly desirable to construct detailed spatio-temporal histories of elevation change. We present in this paper how our recently developed SERAC method (Surface Elevation Reconstruction And Change detection) is well suited to cope with this fusion problem. More specifically, we describe a novel approach to adjust stereoscopic DEMs to the laser altimeny point cloud, based on height corrections determined from the time-series of elevation changes calculated by SERAC. These corrections are then used in a height adjustment of the DEMs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study shows how different remote sensing techniques can be used to distinguish between surface accumulations (scum) and dense blooms of cyanobacteria in the Curonian Lagoon, the largest lagoon in Europe. Cyanobacteria blooms are a major concern in this region due to water quality issues interfering with the conservation of the whole ecosystem. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations can be extremely high (up to about 500 mg/m(3) in some cases) during cyanobacteria blooms, which are often associated with a surface accumulation of algae. The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) was used to acquire 52 images covering the summers of 2004 to 2011. These images were analyzed to map Chl-a concentrations and the presence of scum using two different band ratio algorithms applied to atmospherically-corrected data. The results identify wind speed as the main driving factor in the surface accumulation of algae, as well as in the spatial distribution of Chl-a. The utility of microwave images was also assessed, as since any cloud cover obviously hampers the use of optical data. Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images were collected synchronously with the MERIS data and the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) signal was corrected for the contribution of wind for the purposes of correlating the results with the MERIS-derived Chl-a concentrations. In general, there was a stepwise decrease in the NRCS for high values of Chl-a (>50 mg/m3) with wind speeds in the range of 2 to 6 m/s. Under these conditions, our results demonstrate that optical and microwave signals can be used in combination to improve our understanding of cyanobacteria blooming.

AB In this study, we evaluate the relationships between the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and light-use efficiency (LUE) based on eight years of continuous in situ measurements acquired on a half-hourly basis for PRI, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), the main micrometeorological variables and net CO2 exchange data in two deciduous and evergreen mature forests. More specifically, the objectives of this study include investigating the daily, seasonal, and interannual variations of PRI and LUE; linking PRI variations to the main influencing meteorological and eco-physiological variables; and evaluating the performance of PRI as a remote-sensing proxy of LUE under different environmental conditions. The data analysis was performed at different time scales within the season using moving temporal windows and between years. On a seasonal scale, statistical analyses revealed positive relationships between PRI and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (aPAR) and negative relationships between PRI and LUE. Over shorter periods of a few days, the signs of these relationships remained unchanged; however, their correlations were strongly improved. The highest correlations were most often observed over periods characterized by clear or slightly overcast skies. However, all the periods of clear skies did not involve improvements in the relations of PRI vs. aPAR or PRI vs. LUE. Temporal variations of the intercept (called PRI in this study) of PRI vs. aPAR regressions suggest the presence of a temporal trend that may reflect seasonal changes of the biochemical characteristics of the canopy. Regardless of the cause of this trend, it is important to note that once PRI was subtracted from the measured PRI, the correlations between the corrected PRI and LUE for each year were significantly improved, and a stable multi-year model was obtained. Nevertheless, further studies are required to explain the temporal changes of PRI during the season and to develop a more accurate disentangling approach that would make PRI-based remote-sensing of ecosystem light-use efficiency less sensitive to confounding factors related to spatial and temporal changes in the structural and biochemical properties of the canopy.

AB Rapidly accelerating ground subsidence in the south-western part of British Columbia, the third largest metropolitan area in Canada with over 2.3 million of inhabitants, is estimated using the Multidimensional Small Baseline Subset (MSBAS) advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), an effective processing strategy for multi-mission, multi-temporal SAR data. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data used in this study consists of seven independent data sets: one ascending and one descending ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT frames, together spanning July 1995-September 2010, and three RADARSAT-2 frames spanning February 2009-October 2012. During the July 1995-October 2012 period we observe fast ground subsidence with a maximum rate of about 2 cm/year in the Greater Vancouver region that includes the Fraser River Delta and the cities of Burnaby, Richmond, Surrey, New Westminster and Vancouver. The rapidly accelerating subsidence is observed beneath the Vancouver International Airport, SkyTrain terminal as well as several agricultural and industrial locales. These time series suggest that the subsidence rate at the studied regions does not decrease with time, as suggested in previous studies, but remains steady or increases. These results also demonstrate the importance of acquiring and appropriately estimating longer time series, as previous studies on the same Greater Vancouver area may have misinterpreted the long term ground deformation rate and direction and underestimated the potential hazard. The long term impact of this subsidence on urban infrastructure can be significant and needs to be investigated further. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Accuracy of aerosol scattering reflectance in atmospheric correction is crucial for satellite ocean color remote sensing. A new approach is developed to estimate aerosol scattering reflectance from satellite data based on a look-up table of in situ water-leaving reflectance. A decision rule is set to determine the water-leaving component of the total satellite-measured radiance from the table under an assumption that aerosol scattering reflectance follows the Angstrom law. The epsilon spectrum, obtained from the ratio of aerosol scattering reflectance, is used to select the two closest aerosol models for determining the corrected epsilon values, which is adjusted to new values according to the reference wavelength. The actual aerosol scattering reflectance is obtained from the mean value of the reflectance and the new epsilon spectrum. The performance of the model is evaluated using the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery, showing that the component of aerosol scattering reflectance can be completely separated from the total satellite-measured radiance, and effects of non-zero water-leaving reflectance can be eliminated over highly turbid waters. The accuracy is validated by in situ measured aerosol optical thickness (AOT) using a handheld multi-band sun photometer and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measured AOT data during the 2006 winter cruise and 2007 autumn cruise over the East China Sea (ECS). The analysis gives the mean relative errors of 23.73% and 32.04%, respectively. Our analysis shows that aerosol scattering reflectance can be significantly overestimated over turbid waters when using the atmospheric correction method based on the black ocean assumption (BOA). It may also have some errors over oceanic waters because a small 1% bias of satellite-measured reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) bands will lead to a relatively large error of similar to 10% in aerosol scattering reflectance in Band 1. This error will spread to water-leaving reflectance, possibly leading to negative values of water-leaving reflectance. This amplifying effect of aerosol scattering reflectance can be limited by matching aerosol models using epsilon spectrum in our model. Because the assumption of aerosol scattering reflectance following the Angstrom law can eliminate effects of different types of waters including open ocean, coastal regions, lakes and rivers, our model offers a potentially universal algorithm for estimating aerosol scattering reflectance from satellite remote sensing data.

AB The objectives of this study are to evaluate the applicability of three existing retrieval algorithms of diffuse attenuation coefficients of downwelling irradiance at 490 nm, K-d(490), for turbid Case II waters, and to improve these existing models using a simple semi-analytical (SSA) model. In this study, based on comparison of the K-d(490) predicted by these models with field measurements taken in the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea, it is shown that the SSA model provides a stronger performance than these three selected existing models. The atmospheric influences on the MODIS data are removed using an improved shortwave infrared band-based (ISWIR-based) model, which is capable of retrieving spectral remote sensing reflectance within 19% uncertainty. The K-d(490) data was quantified from the MODIS images after atmospheric correction using the SSA model and Wang's model. The study results indicate that the SSA model produces 31.51% uncertainty in deriving K-d(490) from MODIS data, which is 12.1% higher than Wang's model. This study demonstrates the potential of the SSA model in estimating K-d(490) even in highly turbid coastal waters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wetlands are among the most ecologically important ecosystems on Earth and their sustainability depends critically on the water resources. In a scenario of climate change and increased anthropogenic pressure, detailed monitoring of the water resources provides a fundamental tool to assess the ecosystem health and identify potential threats.
   Donana wetlands, in Southwest Spain, dry out every summer and progressively flood in fall and winter to a maximum extent of 30,000 ha. The wetland filling up process was monitored in detail during the 2006-2007 hydrologic cycle by means of twenty-one Envisat/ASAR scenes, acquired at different incidence angles in order to maximize the observation frequency. Flood mapping from the two uncorrelated ASAR channel data alone was proved unfeasible due to the complex casuistic of Donana cover backscattering. This study addresses the synergistic utilization of the ASAR data together with Donana's digital elevation model and vegetation map in order to achieve flood mapping. Filtering and clustering algorithms were developed for the automated generation of Donana flood maps from the ASAR images. The use of irregular filtering neighborhoods adapted to the elevation contours drastically improved the ASAR image filtering. Edge preservation was excellent, since natural edges closely follow terrain contours. Isotropic neighborhoods were assumed of a single class and their intensities were averaged. As a result, intensity fluctuations due to speckle and texture over areas of the same cover type were smoothed remarkably.
   The clustering and classification algorithm operate on individual sub-basins, as the pixel elevation is more accurately related to the cover classes within them. Vegetation and elevation maps plus knowledge of Donana backscattering characteristics from preceding studies were initially used to select seed pixels with high confidence on their class membership. Next, a region growing algorithm extends the seed regions with new pixels based on their planimmetric adjacency and backscattering Mahalanobis distance to the seeds.
   During the seed region growth, new pixels' possible classes are not constrained to their cover type according to the vegetation map, so the algorithm is able to capture temporal changes in the vegetation spatial distribution. Comparison of the resultant classification and concurrent ground truth yielded 92% of flood mapping accuracy. The flood mapping method is applicable to the available ASAR images of Donana from six other hydrologic cycles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite remote sensing of ocean color in dynamic coastal, inland, and nearshore waters is impeded by high variability in optical constituents, demands specialized atmospheric correction, and is limited by instrument sensitivity. To accurately detect dispersion of bio-optical properties, remote sensors require ample signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to sense small variations in ocean color without saturating over bright pixels, an atmospheric correction that can accommodate significant water-leaving radiance in the near infrared (NIR), and spatial and temporal resolution that coincides with the scales of variability in the environment. Several current and historic space-borne sensors have met these requirements with success in the open ocean, but are not optimized for highly red-reflective and heterogeneous waters such as those found near river outflows or in the presence of sediment resuspension. Here we apply analytical approaches for determining optimal spatial resolution, dominant spatial scales of variability ("patches"), and proportions of patch variability that can be resolved from four river plumes around the world between 2008 and 2011. An offshore region in the Sargasso Sea is analyzed for comparison. A method is presented for processing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra imagery including cloud detection, stray light masking, faulty detector avoidance, and dynamic aerosol correction using short-wave- and near-infrared wavebands in extremely turbid regions which pose distinct optical and technical challenges. Results show that a pixel size of similar to 520 m or smaller is generally required to resolve spatial heterogeneity in ocean color and total suspended materials in river plumes. Optimal pixel size increases with distance from shore to similar to 630 m in nearshore regions, similar to 750 m on the continental shelf, and similar to 1350 m in the open ocean. Greater than 90% of the optical variability within plume regions is resolvable with 500 m resolution, and small, but significant, differences were found between peak and nadir river flow periods in terms of optimal resolution and resolvable proportion of variability.

AB The Red Sea is a unique marine environment but relatively unexplored. The only available long-term biological dataset at large spatial and temporal scales is remotely-sensed chlorophyll observations (an index of phytoplankton biomass) derived using satellite measurements of ocean colour. Yet such observations have rarely been compared with in situ data in the Red Sea. In this paper, satellite chlorophyll estimates in the Red Sea from the MODIS instrument onboard the Aqua satellite are compared with three recent cruises of in vivo fluorometric chlorophyll measurements taken in October 2008, March 2010 and September to October 2011. The performance of the standard NASA chlorophyll algorithm, and that of a new band-difference algorithm, is found to be comparable with other oligotrophic regions in the global ocean, supporting the use of satellite ocean colour in the Red Sea. However, given the unique environmental conditions of the study area, regional algorithms are likely to fare better and this is demonstrated through a simple adjustment to the band-difference algorithm.

AB In radiative transfer modeling, the angular variable Omega discretization can strongly influence the radiative transfer simulation, especially with small numbers of discrete directions. Most radiative transfer models use discrete ordinate method or finite volume method for solving the transport equation. Both of the methods have their own algorithms to discretize the 4 pi space, under the constraint of satisfying geometric symmetry and specific moments. This paper introduces a new direction discretization and oversampling scheme, IUSD, and compares it with the other methods in simulating satellite signals. This method considers the constraint of geometric shape of angular sector, and iteratively discretizes the 4 pi space under this constraint. The result shows that IUSD is quite competitive in the accuracy of simulating remote sensing images. Furthermore, the new method provides a flexibility for adding any oversampling angular region, with any number of additional directions, using an optimal approach in terms of the total number of directions. Several case studies are presented. It turns out that the regional oversampling has significant influence for strong anisotropic scattering. This method has been implemented in the latest code of DART 3D radiative transfer model. DART is available for scientific purpose upon request. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB While empirical and semi-analytical algorithms that retrieve phytoplankton biomass from satellite ocean color have matured over the last few decades, the use of Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data measured by spacebome sensors remains in its infancy. Sun-induced fluorescence has the potential to provide a synoptic global view of aspects of phytoplankton biology that go beyond biomass by observing the quantum yield of fluorescence. While several algorithms have been developed to retrieve the quantum yield, they are prone to biases from different sources. In this study, we assessed the accuracy of several ocean color algorithms to estimate phytoplankton chlorophyll or absorption when they are used together with Sun-induced fluorescence algorithms. Our analysis led us to develop a new type of algorithm for retrieving variability in the quantum yield of fluorescence. Based on a three dimensional lookup table, this algorithm avoided many of the biases present in older algorithms and provided distributions of the quantum yield that showed significant differences compared to previous methods. This algorithmic approach also has the advantage of being robust with respect to sensor characteristics and to the set of underlying proxies that are used, namely phytoplankton biomass, the absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter, and the incident irradiance. As such, it would be suitable for merging data from multiple satellite ocean color sensors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Fire radiative power (FRP) over a pixel area has been highlighted as a valuable parameter for quantitatively deriving smoke emissions. However, smoke plume rise forecasts and characterizations of fire intensity require additional information, including the FRP over the fire area (FRPf) and per fire area (or fire radiative flux), both of which can be calculated through a bi-spectral retrieval of sub-pixel fire area and temperature. This study, the second in a two-part series, examines the sources of error and the corresponding uncertainties in a sub-pixel algorithm that calculates FRPf for fire pixels identified at 1 km(2) nominal spatial resolution by the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire detection algorithm (collection 5). Radiative transfer simulations are incorporated to account for atmospheric effects as a function of Earth-satellite geometry at 3.96 and 11 mu m (MODIS fire detection channels), and show that the 11 mu m channel is highly sensitive to variations in column water vapor amount. By investigating several fire events in California, considerable variations in retrieved fire area, occasionally by more than 50%, are observed when comparing the mid-latitude summer climatology and observation-based atmospheric profiles that are used in the sub-pixel retrieval algorithm. While regions of dry, brown vegetation may also increase the potential for error via the surface emissivity assumption, the algorithm is much more sensitive to errors in 11 mu m background brightness temperature, where an error of only 1.0 K may alter the retrieved fire area by an order of magnitude or more. An independent application, using the Texas wildfire event of September 2011, reveals that the sub-pixel retrieval can even become irrelevant for 17.6% of the available MODIS fire pixels as a result of noise in the background region causing the 11 mu m background brightness temperature to become wanner than the fire pixel, especially during daytime scenes. The various sources of uncertainty in the estimates of FRPf and fire area can be reduced through the summation of individual pixel-level retrievals for large clusters of fire pixels, which can be defined based on the resolution of a mesoscale model grid. In comparison to the standard MODIS pixel-based FRP, the flux of FRPf, defined as total FRPf divided by the retrieved fire area, is shown to have a stronger and statistically significant correlation with surface (10-meter) wind speed and air temperature, especially for large fire pixel clusters, where the respective linear correlation coefficients are 0.55 and 0.77. These strong relationships suggest that, while additional studies are warranted, the flux of FRPf may offer the potential for improved characterizations of the meteorological effects on fire intensity compared to the standard pixel-based FRP.

AB The Lower Nhecolandia subregion of the Brazilian Pantanal is part of a large continuous tropical wetland that exhibits a high biodiversity of flora and fauna species, and many threatened habitats. The spatial distribution of these habitats influence the abundance and interactions of animal species, and the change or destruction of habitat can cause the disturbance of key biological processes. This study uses multi-temporal L-band ALOS/PALSAR, C-band RADARSAT-2, and ENVISAT/ASAR data to map ecosystems and create a lake distribution map of the Lower Nhecolandia subregion in the Brazilian Pantanal. First, backscattering analysis was conducted on individual training objects to gain a better understanding of the backscattering characteristics of each class. Then, a Level 1 object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification based on hierarchical principles first classified the region into "Lakes" and "Not Lakes". This was followed by a Level 2 classification defining six vegetation habitats (Forest Woodland, Open Wood Savanna, Open Grass Savanna, Agriculture, Swampy Grassland and Vazantes) which was achieved at an overall accuracy of 83%. A Level 3 classification defined the "Lakes" class into a) Fresh (baias) and Brackish (salinas) lakes (accuracy results of 98%); and a further classification level dividing the fresh lakes, b) Fresh lakes with floating and emergent vegetation (baias), and Fresh lakes with the presence of Typha (salobras), and including the Brackish lakes (salinas) (overall accuracy results of 81%). The results of this study provide the first fine spatial resolution classification showing the spatial distribution of terrestrial and aquatic habitats for the entire subregion of Lower Nhecolandia using dual season, dual polarization C and L-band SAR imagery. The produced maps will provide valuable habitat information to help define conservation strategies and aid further research in the area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing offers a unique perspective of plant vigor based on reflectance of the crops' canopy. The goal of this study was to determine how deep into the maize canopy red-edge chlorophyll index, Cl-red edge. was affected by foliar chlorophyll (Chl) content and leaf area. Reflectance in the range 400 to 900 nm was measured at both the leaf and canopy levels and was used to determine foliar Chl and total canopy Chl content using Cl-red edge. Statistical techniques, a hierarchical regression and three Aikaike Information Criteria, were used to determine how many leaf layers are sensed by the Cl-red edge. All statistical techniques showed that the Cl-red edge senses the chlorophyll content of the upper 7 to 9 leaf layers in a maize canopy and that remote sensing technique is able to accurately estimate maize canopy Chl content.

AB Satellite sensor-derived data are suitable for regional estimations of several important biophysical variables. Data with a finer spatial resolution should improve regional estimations of GPP (gross primary productivity), since they better capture the variation in a heterogeneous landscape. The main objective of this study was to investigate if MODIS 500 m reflectance data can be used to drive empirical models for regional estimations of GPP in Nordic forests. The performance of the proposed models was compared with the MODIS 1 km GPP product. Linear regression analyses were made on 8-day averages of eddy covariance GPP from three deciduous and ten coniferous sites in relation to MODIS 8-day composite data and 8-day averages of modeled incoming PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density). Time series of EVI2 (two-band enhanced vegetation index) were calculated from MODIS 500 m reflectance data and smoothed by a curve fitting procedure. For most sites, GPP was fairly strongly to strongly related to the product of EVI2 and PPFD (Deciduous: R-2=0.45-0.86, Coniferous: R-2=0.49-0.90). Similar strengths were found between GPP and the product of EVI2 and MODIS 1 km daytime LST (land surface temperature) (R-2=0.55-0.81, 0.57-0.77) and between GPP and EVI2, PPFD and daytime LST in multiple linear regressions (R-2=0.73-0.89,0.65-0.93). One year of data was collected from all coniferous sites to derive a general empirical model for GPP versus (1) the product of EVI2 and PPFD (R-2=0.70), (2) the product of EVI2 and daytime LST (R-2=0.62) and (3) EVI2, PPFD and daytime LST (R-2=0.72). These three models were then validated at six sites for the remaining years by linearly relating eddy covariance GPP to modeled GPP, which resulted in fairly strong to strong relationships for most sites (R-2=0.49-0.91, RMSE=0.63-1.22 gC m(-2) day(-1), R-2=0.53-0.73, RMSE=0.90-1.43 gC m(-2) day(-1) R-2=0.56-0.87, RMSE=0.79-1.11 gC m(-2) day(-1)). In comparison, similar validation strengths were found for the latest collection 5.1 of the MODIS 1 km GPP product (R-2=0.59-0.88, RMSE=0.80-1.16 gC m(-2) day(-1)). The main conclusion is that the suggested empirical models driven by MODIS 500 m reflectance data can be used for regional estimations of Nordic forest GPP, while preserving a finer resolution than the MODIS 1 km GPP product.

AB In this study, typhoon eyes are delineated using wavelet analysis from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and infrared (IR) images to detect the "eyes" on the sea surface and at the cloud top, respectively. Because of the vertical wind shear, which acts as an upright tilt, the location of the typhoon eye on the sea surface differs from that at the top of the clouds. Consequently, the large horizontal distance between typhoon eyes on the sea surface and on the cloud top implies that the vertical wind shear profile is considerably more complex than generally expected. The upright tilt may be caused by the ocean's feedback or the effect of island obstruction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The NOAA-AVHRR Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset is used to investigate the predictability of the vegetation cycle in an area centred on the Gourma region in Sahelian Mali at scales varying from 8 km(2) to 1024 km(2) over a period spanning from 1982 to 2004. The predictability of the vegetation cycle is analysed with a model based on a reconstruction approach that fully relies on the dataset. Two parameters deduced from the growth of the forecast error are considered: the horizon of effective predictability, H-E, which is the horizon at which a satisfying prediction can be effectively forecasted at a given level of error, and the level of noise.
   Predictability is therefore analysed with regard to the horizon of prediction and the spatial scale; the influence of the model's dimensions is also discussed. The analysis clearly indicates that the signal predictability increases, and the level of noise decreases with an expanding area. However, even though the signal is more regular, its complexity increases within the narrowing entangled trajectory, setting the level of error of any prediction at a minimum of 15%, which matches the level of noise characteristic of the AVHRR-NDVI data series.
   The forecasting error quickly increases with the horizon of prediction, setting the optimum horizon of predictability in the range of 2 to 4 decades, with high intra-annual variability. At the short horizon of 1 decade, a resolution of 16 km(2) is reasonable to achieve an accuracy of approximately 20%. At the longer horizon of 3 decades, only low resolutions (256 km(2) or lower) give an accuracy equal to or better than 35%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The paper highlights recent results of forest structure analysis at single tree level based on analyzing airborne full waveform LiDAR data. Single trees are automatically detected by a 3D segmentation technique applied directly to laser point clouds, which uses the normalized cut segmentation combined with a stem detection method. A subsequent classification identifies tree species using salient features that are defined on single 3D tree segments and utilize the additional information extracted from the reflected laser signal by the waveform decomposition. The stem volume and diameter at breast height (DBH) are estimated by a multiple linear regression analysis which uses tree shape parameters derived from the 3D model of the trees. Experiments were conducted in the Bavarian Forest National Park with full waveform LiDAR data. The data were captured with the Riegl LMS Q-560 system at a point density of 25 points/m(2) under leaf-off and leaf-on conditions. The analysis of waveform data in the tree structure shows that the intensity and pulse width discriminate stem points, crown points and ground points significantly. The unsupervised classification of deciduous and coniferous trees is in the best case 93%. If a supervised classification is applied the accuracy is slightly increased to 95%. Concerning stem volume estimation, in the case of coniferous trees the study shows a low RMSE of about 0.46 m(3) to 0.43 m(3) both for the watershed segmentation and the new normalized cut segmentation. In the case of deciduous trees RMSE has increased by 14% in leaf off condition and by 4% in leaf on condition for the normalized cut segmentation. A similar trend can be confirmed for DBH estimation as well, even demonstrating a larger benefit from 3D segmentation. The study results proved that the 3D segmentation approach is not only capable of detecting more small trees in the lower forest layer but also can allow to derive more promising features of single trees used for yielding better performance in species classification and estimation of forest structural parameters, especially for deciduous trees.

AB Remote detection of management-related trend in the presence of inter-annual climatic variability in the rangelands is difficult. Minimally disturbed reference areas provide a useful guide, but suitable benchmarks are usually difficult to identify. We describe a method that uses a unique conceptual framework to identify reference areas from multitemporal sequences of ground cover derived from Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery. The method does not require ground-based reference sites nor GIS layers about management. We calculate a minimum ground cover image across all years to identify locations of most persistent ground cover in years of lowest rainfall. We then use a moving window approach to calculate the difference between the window's central pixel and its surrounding reference pixels. This difference estimates ground-cover change between successive below-average rainfall years, which provides a seasonally interpreted measure of management effects. We examine the approach's sensitivity to window size and to cover-index percentiles used to define persistence. The method successfully detected management-related change in ground cover in Queensland tropical savanna woodlands in two case studies: (1) a grazing trial where heavy stocking resulted in substantial decline in ground cover in small paddocks, and (2) commercial paddocks where wet-season spelling (destocking) resulted in increased ground cover. At a larger scale, there was broad agreement between our analysis of ground-cover change and ground-based land condition change for commercial beef properties with different a priori ratings of initial condition, but there was also some disagreement where changing condition reflected pasture composition rather than ground cover. We conclude that the method is suitably robust to analyse grazing effects on ground cover across the 1.3 x 10(6) km(2) of Queensland's rangelands. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The relationship between lidar-derived metrics and biomass could vary across different vegetation types. However, in many studies, there are usually a limited number of field plots associated with each vegetation type, making it difficult to fit reliable statistical models for each vegetation type. To address this problem, this study used mixed-effects modeling to integrate airborne lidar data and vegetation types derived from aerial photographs for biomass mapping over a forest site in the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California, USA. It was found that the incorporation of vegetation types via mixed-effects models can improve biomass estimation from sparse samples. Compared to the use of lidar data alone in multiplicative models, the mixed-effects models could increase the R-2 from 0.77 to 0.83 with RMSE (root mean square error) reduced by 10% (from 80.8 to 72.2 Mg/ha) when the lidar metrics derived from all returns were used. It was also found that the SAF (Society of American Forest) cover types are as powerful as the NVC (National Vegetation Classification) alliance-level vegetation types in the mixed-effects modeling of biomass, implying that the future mapping of vegetation classes could focus on dominant species. This research can be extended to investigate the synergistic use of high spatial resolution satellite imagery, digital image classification, and airborne lidar data for more automatic mapping of vegetation types, biomass, and carbon.

AB Optical leveling campaigns, tiltmeters, GPS and InSAR are geodetic techniques used to detect and monitor surface deformation phenomena. In particular, InSAR data from satellite radar sensors are gaining increasing attention for their cost-effectiveness and unique technical features, making possible the monitoring of large areas, even revisiting the past. Moreover, more advanced InSAR techniques (PSInSAR (TM), SqueeSAR (TM)) developed in the last decade are capable of providing millimeter precision, comparable to optical leveling, and a high spatial density of displacement measurements, over long periods of time without need of installing equipment or otherwise accessing the study area.
   Thanks to the high density and quality of the measurements the PSInSAR data can be successfully used in geophysical inversion, to measure the permeability of oil reservoirs and/or to evaluate the possibilities and risks due to seismic faulting in the sequestration of CO2. In these cases, the precision, the sub weekly frequency of the measurements and the time required for the data to be available are the most important aspects, more relevant than the spatial resolution.
   Until recently, the main limitation to the application of InSAR was the relatively long revisiting time (24 or 35 days) and the quite long waiting period for the delivery of the acquired data. The new Sentinel-1 mission, based on a constellation of two satellites, is expected to reduce such limitations guaranteeing a revisit cycle of 6 days on a global scale and in particular over Europe and Canada and providing a high level of service reliability with near-real-time delivery of data within 24 h, important for risk management applications. The new X band satellite SAR constellations like Cosmo Skymed and TerraSAR X have also a short revisiting time, from 4 to 11 days. However, their coverage is limited to well definite areas, and an expensive decision has to be made if to initiate the observations on any target. Sentinel 1, instead, yields global and costless observations and thus, after the end of the commissioning phase, will always produce present and past ground motion for any target.
   It's important to underline that the millimeter accuracy, applying the InSAR analysis with Sentinel-1, will be achieved within a shorter observation time frame, thanks to the increased number of acquired images per year (Attema et al. 2010, De Zan et al., 2008). Results from ground based radar show that this improved precision is indeed achievable from C to Ku band, provided that an accurate model of the delay due to atmospheric water vapor is available or that precise reference points are close by.

AB We explore new possibilities offered by the recently available X-band satellite radar sensors for landslide hazard assessments on a detailed scale, with particular reference to the exploitation of Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) techniques. Special attention is paid to the impact of the improved resolution of new X-band radar imagery on the PSI results, in terms of quality and quantity of useful information. This evaluation is supported by theoretical modelling as well as by the comparison of results from x-band (CSK) and C-band (ENVISAT) PSI for two areas of interest: one in Italy and the other in Switzerland. It is demonstrated that with respect to medium resolution ENVISAT PS processing, fewer CSK high resolution images are sufficient to achieve comparable precision of the mean displacement velocity estimates. This, together with the shorter revisit times provided by the CSK( constellation, can be very important when dealing with emergency situations. Furthermore, it is quantified that from about 3 to 11 times greater PS densities are obtained with the higher resolution X-band data. This implies more information about ground surface displacements as well as improved landslide monitoring and slope instability investigation capabilities. Furthermore, ground displacement measurements can be interpreted without local knowledge of the focus area or in situ controls, and, nonetheless, guide single hillslope instability assessments with support of Google Earth and its high resolution optical imagery. This "blind" approach will allow one to monitor remote and poorly known regions at high risk of potentially disastrous slope failures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface albedo is one of the key geophysical variables controlling the surface radiation budget. In recent years, land surface albedo products have been generated using data from various satellites. However, some problems exist in those products due to either the failure of the current retrieving procedures resulting from persistent clouds and/or abrupt surface changes, or the reduced temporal or spatial coverage, which may limit their applications. Rapidly generated albedo products that help reduce the impacts of cloud contamination and improve the capture of events such as ephemeral snow and vegetation growth are in demand.
   In this study, we propose a method for estimating the land surface albedo from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data using a short temporal window. Instead of executing the atmospheric correction first and then fitting the surface reflectance in the current MODIS albedo procedure, the atmospheric properties (e.g., aerosol optical depth) and surface properties (e.g., surface bidirectional reflectance) were estimated simultaneously. Validations were carried out using various data sources including ground measurements (e.g., from the Surface Radiation (SURFRAD) Network and Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net)) and MODIS AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (MODASRVN) data. The results showed comparable albedo estimates with both MODIS data and ground measurements, and the MODASRVN instantaneous surface reflectance was in good agreement with the reflectance estimation from our method. Aerosol optical depth (ADD) retrievals over SURFRAD and MODASRVN sites were also compared with ground measurements. Validation results showed estimation accuracies similar to those of MODIS aerosol products. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Species richness increases markedly during the first years after fire, driven mainly by the increase in the number of herbaceous species. However, such increase is variable in space and time, due to the role that the different plant life-forms can play after the fire disturbance. In addition, the absence of reliable species richness information can be a limitation for decision making when postfire management actions are needed. In this study we used QuickBird imagery to develop multiscale, spatially explicit predictive models of species richness in a burned area 1 year after a fire. The study area is an abandoned dehesa (a Quercus suber (cork oak) open woodland with shrubs) of central Spain, which had been affected by a large summer fire. Two 90 x 180 m macroplots were established, where species richness and percentage cover of various plant life-forms were measured at three spatial scales (1, 25, and 100 m(2)). Total plant species richness was related to reflectance and spectral contrast derived from the multispectral bands of QuickBird and to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), by using regression tree analysis (RTA) and boosted regression trees (BRT). Furthermore, for the biophysical support of such models, plant species richness was related to field-based compositional data, and life-form percentage cover to satellite data. Results indicated that the relationship between species richness, reflectance and spectral contrast was strong and scale-dependent (1 m(2): adjusted R-2=0.50; 25m(2): adj. R-2=0.65; 100 m(2): adj. R-2=0.79), whereas NDVI played a minor role at all scales. At the finest sampling scale, a low range of species richness was related to a high variability of spectral and texture responses, due to the excess of spatial detail of the pixel size. At 25 m2, a higher range of species richness was related to a low variability of spectral and texture responses; this was probably due to the fact that the sampling size only captured certain portions of plant individuals or life-form associations. At the largest sampling scale (100 m(2)), the highest variability of species richness was adequately related to the spectral and texture responses, due to the spatial fit between the sampling plot size and both the pixel- and plant-sizes. Species richness was closely linked to life-form percentage cover (mainly to herbaceous plant cover), and life-form cover was adequately explained by satellite data, giving a biophysical support to our predictive models. Reflectance and spectral contrast were good predictive tools of total plant species richness at the largest sampling scale, but their predictive power diminished at the smaller scales. This was explained by the range of species richness measured at each scale, the spatial arrangement of species, and the ratio of the spatial resolution (both for pixels from satellite data and for ground sampling plots) to the size of the objects. These results contribute to improve our knowledge about the link between high spatial resolution remotely sensed data and species richness at different sampling scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Promising results have been obtained in recent years in the use of high-resolution X-band stereo SAR satellite images (with the spatial resolution being in order of meters) in the extraction of elevation data. In the case of forested areas, the extracted elevation values appear to be somewhere between the ground surface and the top of the canopy, depending on the forest characteristics. If the ground surface elevations are known by using a Digital Terrain Model derived from Airborne Laser Scanning surveys, it is possible to obtain information related to forest resources. To the best of our knowledge, this paper, presents the first attempt to obtain forest variables at plot level based on TerraSAR-X stereo SAR images (non-interferometric data). The study set consisted of 109 circular test plots for which forest variables were observed by performing tree-specific measurements. The statistical features were calculated for each test plot from the elevation values extracted from stereo SAR data. This was followed by predicting field-observed plot-level forest variables from the features derived from stereo SAR data using the Nearest Neighbors approach which employs the Random Forest technique in selection of the nearest neighbors. The relative errors (RMSE%) for predicting the stem volume, basal area, mean forest canopy height, and mean diameter values were 34.0%, 29.0%, 14.0%, and 19.7%, respectively. The results indicate that there was no clear saturation level in stem volume estimation. In this case study, stem volumes were predicted up to about 400 m(3)/ha. In the light of these results, stereo SAR data appears to be an interesting remote-sensing technique for future forest inventories. For example, stereo SAR data could have high potential in forest inventories as the SAR-based features can be adapted to the methods currently used in inventories. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB The California sage scrub (CSS) community type in California's Mediterranean-type ecosystems is known for its high biodiversity and is home to a large number of rare, threatened, and endangered species. Because of extensive urban development in the past fifty years, this ecologically significant community type is highly degraded and fragmented. To conserve endangered CSS communities, monitoring internal conditions of communities is as crucial as monitoring distributions of the community type in the region. Vegetation type mapping and field sampling of individual plants provide ecologically meaningful information about CSS communities such as spatial distribution and species compositions, respectively. However, both approaches only provide spatially comprehensive information but no information about internal conditions or vice versa. Therefore, there is a need for monitoring variables which fill the information gap between vegetation type maps and field-based data. A number of field-based studies indicate that life-form fractional cover is an effective indicator of CSS community health and habitat quality for CSS-obligated species. This study investigates the effectiveness of remote sensing approaches for estimating fractional cover of true shrub, subshrub, herb, and bare ground in CSS communities of southern California. Combinations of four types of multispectral imagery ranging from 0.15 m resolution scanned color infrared aerial photography to 10 m resolution SPOT 5 multispectral imagery and three image processing models - per-pixel, object-based, and spectral mixture models - were tested.
   An object-based image analysis (OBIA) routine consistently yielded higher accuracy than other image processing methods for estimating all cover types. Life-form cover was reliably predicted, with error magnitudes as low as 2%. Subshrub and herb cover types required finer spatial resolution imagery for more accurate predictions than true shrub and bare ground types. Positioning of sampling grids had a substantial impact on the reliability of accuracy assessment, particularly for cover estimates predicted using multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) applied to SPOT imagery. Of the approaches tested in this study, OBIA using pansharpened QuickBird imagery is one of the most promising approaches because of its high accuracy and processing efficiency and should be tested for more heterogeneous CSS landscapes. MESMA applied to SPOT imagery should also be examined for effectiveness in estimating factional cover over more extensive habitat areas because of its low data cost and potential for conducting retrospective studies of vegetation community conditions.

AB The availability of precipitation data with high spatial resolution is of fundamental importance in several applications such as hydrology, meteorology and ecology. At present, there are mainly two sources of precipitation estimates: raingauge stations and remote sensing technology. However, a large number of studies demonstrated that traditional point measurements based on raingauge stations cannot reflect the spatial variation of precipitation effectively, especially in ungauged basins. The technology of remote sensing has greatly improved the quality of precipitation observations and produced reasonably high resolution gridded precipitation fields. These products, derived from satellites, have been widely used in various parts of the world. However, when applied to local basins and regions, the spatial resolution of these products is too coarse. In this paper, we present a statistical downscaling algorithm based on the relationships between precipitation and other environmental factors in the Qaidam Basin such as topography and vegetation, which was developed for downscaling the spatial precipitation fields of these remote sensing products. This algorithm is demonstrated with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 dataset, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and SPOT VEGETATION. The statistical relationship among precipitation, DEM and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is a proxy for vegetation, is variable at different scales: therefore, a multiple linear regression model was established under four different scales (0.25 degrees, 0.50 degrees, 0.75 degrees and 1.00 degrees, respectively). By applying a downscaling methodology, TRMM 3B43 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees precipitation fields were downscaled to 1 x 1 km pixel precipitation for each year from 1999 to 2009. On the basis of three criteria, these four downscaled results were compared with each other and the regression model established at the resolution of 0.50 degrees was selected as the final downscaling algorithm in this study. The final downscaled results were validated by applying the observations for a duration of 11 years obtained from six raingauge stations in the Qaidam Basin. These results indicated that the downscaled result effectively captured the trends in inter-annual variability and the magnitude of annual precipitation with the coefficient of determination r(2) ranging from 0.72 to 0.96 at six different raingauge stations.

AB Passive microwave estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) were examined to determine their usefulness for evaluating water resources in the remote Upper Helmand Watershed, central Afghanistan. SWE estimates from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) passive microwave data were analyzed for six winter seasons, 2004-2009. A second, independent estimate of SWE was calculated for these same time periods using a hydrologic model of the watershed with a temperature index snow model driven using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) gridded estimates of precipitation. The results demonstrate that passive microwave SWE values from SSM/I and AMSR-E are comparable. The AMSR-E sensor had improved performance in the early winter and late spring, which suggests that AMSR-E is better at detecting shallow snowpacks than SSM/I. The timing and magnitude of SWE values from the snow model and the passive microwave observations were sometimes similar with a correlation of 0.53 and accuracy between 55 and 62%. However, the modeled SWE was much lower than the AMSR-E SWE during two winter seasons in which TRMM data estimated lower than normal precipitation. Modeled runoff and reservoir storage predictions improved significantly when peak AMSR-E SWE values were used to update the snow model state during these periods. Rapid decreases in passive microwave SWE during precipitation events were also well aligned with flood flows that increased base flows by 170 and 940%. This finding supports previous northern latitude studies which indicate that the passive microwave signal's lack of scattering can be used to detect snow melt. The current study's extension to rain on snow events suggests an opportunity for added value for flood forecasting. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This study takes advantage of a regionally specific algorithm and the characteristics of Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) in order to deliver more accurate, detailed chlorophyll a (chla) maps of optically complex coastal waters during an upwelling cycle. MERIS full resolution chla concentrations and in situ data were obtained on the Galician (NW Spain) shelf and in three adjacent rias (embayments), sites of extensive mussel culture that experience frequent harmful algal events. Regionally focused algorithms (Regional neural network for rias Babcas or NNRB) for the retrieval of chla in the Galician rias optically complex waters were tested in comparison to sea-truth data. The one that showed the best performance was applied to a series of six MERIS (FR) images during a summer upwelling cycle to test its performance. The best performance parameters were given for the NN trained with high-quality data using the most abundant cluster found in the rias after the application of fuzzy c-mean clustering techniques (FCM). July 2008 was characterized by three periods of different meteorological and oceanographic states. The main changes in chla concentration and distribution were clearly captured in the images. After a period of strong upwelling favorable winds a high biomass algal event was recorded in the study area. However, MERIS missed the high chlorophyll upwelled water that was detected below surface in the ria de Vigo by the chla profiles, proving the necessity of in situ observations. Relatively high biomass "patches" were mapped in detail inside the rias. There was a significant variation in the timing and the extent of the maximum chla areas. The maps confirmed that the complex spatial structure of the phytoplankton distribution in the rias Baixas is affected by the surface currents and winds on the adjacent continental shelf. This study showed that a regionally specific algorithm for an ocean color sensor with the characteristics of MERIS in combination with in situ data can be of great help in chla monitoring, detection and study of high biomass algal events in an area affected by coastal upwelling such as the rias Baixas.

AB The validity of training samples collected in field campaigns is crucial for the success of land use classification models. However, such samples often suffer from a sample selection bias and do not represent the variability of spectra that can be encountered in the entire image. Therefore, to maximize classification performance, one must perform adaptation of the first model to the new data distribution. In this paper, we propose to perform adaptation by sampling new training examples in unknown areas of the image. Our goal is to select these pixels in an intelligent fashion that minimizes their number and maximizes their information content. Two strategies based on uncertainty and clustering of the data space are considered to perform active selection. Experiments on urban and agricultural images show the great potential of the proposed strategy to perform model adaptation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Net primary productivity (NPP) fields, derived from satellite observations of ocean color, are commonly published without relevant information on uncertainties. In this study, we assessed the uncertainty in NPP estimates of the Vertically Generalized Productivity Model using a Monte Carlo approach. We did not consider the uncertainty stemming from the basic model formulation, but restricted the uncertainty analysis to input terms, which were generated by, or related to, remote sensing. The study was based on global monthly remote sensing data from 2005. We found that the typical distribution of uncertainty around the model output could be approximated by a lognormal probability density function. On average, NPP value in a grid cell was overestimated by 6%, relative to the mean of the corresponding uncertainty distribution. The random component of uncertainty in NPP, expressed as the coefficient of variation, amounted to an average of 108%. The systematic positive errors in individual grid cells built up to an overestimate of 2.5 Pg C in the annual global NPP of 46.1 Pg C. The largest individual contributor to the random uncertainty in NPP was the input term that describes the physiological state of phytoplankton. However, the biggest contribution to the systematic uncertainty in the model output came from the parameter that represents changes in the rate of chlorophyll-normalized photosynthesis with depth. Therefore, improvements in the accuracy of these two terms would have the largest potential to decrease the input-related uncertainty in the model NPP estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB The accuracy of the Land Surface Temperature (LST) product generated operationally by the EUMETSAT Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility (LSA SAF) from the data registered by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board the geostationary METEOSAT Second Generation 2 (MSG2, Meteosat 9) satellite was assessed on two test sites in Eastern Spain: a homogeneous, fully vegetated rice field and a high-plain, homogeneous area of shrubland. The LSA SAF LSTs were compared with ground LST measurements in the conventional temperature-based (T-based) method. We also validated the LSA SAF LST product by using an alternative radiance-based (R-based) method, with ground LSTs calculated from MSG-SEVIRI channel 9 brightness temperatures (at 10.8 mu m) through radiative transfer simulations using atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles together with surface emissivity data. Two lakes were also used for validation with the R-based method. Although the LSA SAF LST algorithm works mostly within the uncertainty expectation of +/- 2 K, both validation methods showed significant biases for the LSA SAF LST product, up to 1.5 K in some cases. These biases, with the LSA SAF LST product overestimating reference values, were also observed in previous studies. Nevertheless, the present work points out that the biases are related to the land surface emissivities used in the operational generation of the product. The use of more appropriate emissivity values for the test sites in the LSA SAF LST algorithm led to better results by decreasing the biases by 0.7 K for the shrubland validation site. Furthermore, we proposed and checked an alternative algorithm: a quadratic split-window equation, based on a physical split-window model that has been widely proved for other sensors, with angular-dependent coefficients suitable for the MSG coverage area. The T-based validation results for this algorithm showed LST uncertainties (robust root-mean-squared-errors) from 0.2 K to 0.5 K lower than for the LSA SAF LST algorithm after the emissivity replacement. Nevertheless, the proposed algorithm accuracies were significantly better than those obtained for the current LSA SAF LST product, with an average accuracy difference of 0.6 K. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this study. ICESat altimetry data are used to provide precise lake elevations of the Tibetan Plateau (IF) during the period of 2003-2009. Among the 261 lakes examined ICESat data are available on 111 lakes: 74 lakes with ICESat footprints for 4-7 years and 37 lakes with footprints for 1-3 years. This is the first time that precise lake elevation data are provided for the 111 lakes. Those ICESat elevation data can be used as baselines for future changes in lake levels as well as for changes during the 2003-2009 period. It is found that in the 74 lakes (56 salt lakes) examined, 62 (i.e. 84%) of all lakes and 50 (i.e. 89%) of the salt lakes show tendency of lake level increase. The mean lake water level increase rate is 0.23 m/year for the 56 salt lakes and 0.27 m/year for the 50 salt lakes of water level increase. The largest lake level increase rate (0.80 m/year) found in this study is the lake Cedo Caka. The 74 lakes are grouped into four subareas based on geographical locations and change tendencies in lake levels. Three of the four subareas show increased lake levels. The mean lake level change rates for subareas I, II, III, IV, and the entire TP are 0.12, 0.26, 0.19, -0.11, and 0.2 m/year, respectively. These recent increases in lake level, particularly for a high percentage of salt lakes, supports accelerated glacier melting due to global warming as the most likely cause. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this study we use the 500 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) product to develop multivariate linear regression models that estimate canopy heights over study sites at Howland Forest, Maine, Harvard Forest, Massachusetts and La Selva Forest, Costa Rica using (1) directional escape probabilities that are spectrally independent and (2) the directional spectral reflectances used to derive the directional escape probabilities. These measures of canopy architecture are compared with canopy height information retrieved from the airborne laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS). Both the escape probability and the directional reflectance approaches achieve good results, with correlation coefficients in the range 0.54-0.82, although escape probability results are usually slightly better. This suggests that MODIS 500 m BRDF data can be used to extrapolate canopy heights observed by widely-spaced satellite LIDAR swaths to larger areas, thus providing wide-area coverage of canopy height.

AB The COSMO-SkyMed mission offers a unique opportunity to obtain radar data characterized by short revisit time, thus being useful for flood evolution mapping. A procedure to monitor an inundation event using multitemporal COSMO-SkyMed data is presented in this paper. The methodology is based on an automatic image segmentation technique and on the use of a well-established electromagnetic model to correctly explain the radar return from the image segments. It is applied to a series of five COSMO-SkyMed images regarding an event chosen as a test bed, i.e., a flood occurred in Northern Italy in 2009. In order to associate the segments to the classes of flooded or non-flooded areas, some reference multi-temporal backscattering trends have been assumed with the aid of the theoretical model. Using these reference trends as a training set, a classification algorithm has been developed to generate a map of the flood evolution. Although the methodology needs to be further tested on different case studies, our investigation demonstrates the feasibility and the utility of a combined use of an electromagnetic scattering model and an advanced image processing technique for inundation monitoring.

AB We provide results of quantitative measurements and characterization for inland freshwater Lake Taihu from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the satellite Aqua. China's Lake Taihu, which is located in the Yangtze River delta in one of the world's most urbanized and heavily populated areas, contains consistently highly turbid waters in addition to frequent large seasonal algae blooms in various lake regions. Thus, satellite data processing requires use of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) atmospheric correction algorithm. Specifically for Lake Taihu, an iterative SWIR-based atmospheric correction algorithm has been developed and proven to provide reasonably accurate water-leaving radiance spectra data. Using MODIS-Aqua measurements, the blue-green algae bloom in Lake Taihu in 2007 has been studied in detail, demonstrating the importance and usefulness of satellite water color remote sensing for effectively monitoring and managing a bloom event. Seasonal and interannual variability, as well as spatial distributions, of lake water properties were studied and assessed using the MODIS-Aqua measurements from 2002 to 2008. Results show that overall waters in Lake Taihu are consistently highly turbid all year round, with the winter and summer as the most and least turbid seasons in the lake, respectively. Extremely turbid waters in the winter are primarily attributed to strong winter winds that lead to significant amounts of total suspended sediment (TSS) in the water column. In addition, MODIS-Aqua-measured water-leaving radiance at the blue band is consistently low in various bay regions in Lake Taihu, indicating high algae concentration in these regions. Climatological water property maps, including normalized water-leaving radiance spectra nL(w)(lambda), chlorophyll-a concentration, and water diffuse attenuation coefficient at the wavelength of 490 nm (K-d(490)), are derived from all MODIS-Aqua data from 2002 to 2008 for Lake Taihu, showing overall spatial distribution features for the lake water property.

AB In typical Case 2 waters, accurate remote sensing retrieval of chlorophyll a (chla) is still a challenging task. In this study, focusing on the Galician rias (NW Spain), algorithms based on neural network (NN) techniques were developed for the retrieval of chla concentration in optically complex waters, using Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data. There is considerable interest in the accurate estimation of chla for the Galician rias, because of the economic and social importance of the extensive culture of mussels, and the high frequency of harmful algal events. Fifteen MERIS full resolution (FR) cloud-free images paired with in situ chla data (for 2002-2004 and 2006-2008) were used for the development and validation of the NN. The scope of NN was established from the clusters obtained using fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering techniques applied to the satellite-derived data. Three different NNs were developed: one including the whole data set, and two others using only points belonging to one of the clusters. The input data for these latter two NNs was chosen depending on the quality level, defined on the basis of quality flags given to each data set. The fitting results were fairly good and proved the capability of the tool to predict chla concentrations in the study area. The best prediction was given for the NN trained with high-quality data using the most abundant cluster data set. The performance parameters in the validation set of this NN were R-2 = 0.86, mean percentage error (MPE) = -0.14, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.75 mg m(-3), and relative RMSE = 66%. The NN developed in this study detected accurately the peaks of chla, in both training and validation sets. The performance of the Case-2-Regional (C2R) algorithm, routinely used for MERIS data, was also tested and compared with our best performing NN and the sea-truthing data. Results showed that this NN outperformed the C2R, giving much higher R-2 and lower RMSE values.
   This study showed that the combination of in situ data and NN technology improved the retrieval of chla in Case 2 waters, and could be used to obtain more accurate chla maps. A local-based algorithm for the chla retrieval from an ocean colour sensor with the characteristics of MERIS would be a great support in the quantitative monitoring and study of harmful algal events in the coastal waters of the Rias Baixas. The limitations and possible improvements of the developed chla algorithms are also discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses the effects of vegetation on C- (4.75 GHz) and L- (1.6 GHz) band backscattering (sigma degrees) measured throughout a growth cycle at incidence angles of 15, 35 and 55 degrees. The utilized sigma degrees data set was collected by a truck mounted scatterometer over a corn field and is supported by a comprehensive set of ground measurements, including soil moisture and vegetation biomass. Comparison of sigma degrees measurement against simulations by the Integral Equation Method (IEM) surface scattering model (Fung et al., 1992) shows that the sigma degrees measurements are dominated either by an attenuated soil return or by scattering from vegetation depending on the antenna configuration and growth stage. Further, the measured sigma degrees is found to be sensitive to soil moisture even at peak biomass and large incidence angles, which is attributed to scattering along the soil-vegetation pathway.
   For the simulation of C-band sigma degrees and the retrieval of soil moisture two methods have been applied, which are the semi-empirical water cloud model (Attema & Ulaby, 1978) and a novel method. This alternative method uses the empirical relationships between the vegetation water content (W) and the ratio of the bare soil and the measured sigma degrees to correct for vegetation. It is found that this alternative method is superior in reproducing the measured sigma degrees as well as retrieving soil moisture. The highest retrieval accuracies are obtained at a 35 degrees incidence angle leading to RMSD's of 0.044 and 0.037 m(3) m(-3) for the HH and VV-polarization, respectively. In addition, the sensitivity of these soil moisture retrievals to W and surface roughness parameter uncertainties is investigated. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Dark-spot detection is a critical and fundamental step in marine oil-spill detection and monitoring. In this paper, a novel approach for automated dark-spot detection using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) intensity imagery is presented The key to the approach is making use of a spatial density feature to differentiate between dark spots and the background. A detection window is passed through the entire SAR image. First, intensity threshold segmentation is applied to each window. Pixels with intensities below the threshold are regarded as potential dark-spot pixels while the others are potential background pixels. Second, the density of potential background pixels is estimated using kernel density estimation within each window Pixels with densities below a certain threshold are the real dark-spot pixels. Third, an area threshold and a contrast threshold are used to eliminate any remaining false targets. In the last step, the individual detection results are mosaicked to produce the final result. The proposed approach was tested on 60 RADARSAT-1 ScanSAR intensity Images which contain verified oil-spill anomalies. The same parameters were used in all tests For the overall dataset, the average of commission error, omission error, and average difference were 70%, 6.1%, and 04 pixels, respectively The average number of false alarms was 0 5 per unit image and the average computational time for a detection window was 1.2 s using a PC-based MATLAB platform. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is fast, robust and effective. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a model to calculate depth-resolved marine photochemical fluxes from remotely sensed ocean color and modeled solar irradiance. The basic approach uses three components: 1) below-sea-surface spectral downward scalar irradiance calculated from a radiative transfer model (STAR) and corrected for clouds using TOMS UV reflectivities; 2) surface-ocean spectral diffuse attenuation coefficients and absorption coefficients for chromophoric dissolved organic matter retrieved from SeaWiFS ocean color using the SeaUV/SeaUVc algorithms: and (3) spectral apparent quantum yield for the photochemical reaction considered. The output of the model is a photochemical rate profile, Psi(PR)(z), where z represents depth.
   We implemented the model for carbon monoxide (CO) photochemistry using an average apparent quantum yield spectrum and generated a monthly climatology of depth-resolved CO photoproduction rates in the global ocean. The climatology was used to compute global budgets and investigate the spatial and seasonal variabilities of CO photoproduction in the ocean. The model predicts a global CO photoproduction rate of about 41 TgC yr(-1), in good agreement with other recent published estimates ranging from 30 to 84 TgC yr(-1). The fate of photochemically derived CO and its role in global biogeochemical cycles remains uncertain however, with biological consumption and sea-air exchange competing for its removal in the surface ocean. Knowledge of the vertical distribution of CO photoproduction is critical in the quantification of the relative magnitudes of these sink mechanisms. The depth-resolution capabilities of this model, together with US Naval Research Laboratory climatology for mixed layer depths allowed further estimation that >95% of the total water-column CO photoproduction occurs within the mixed layer on a global, yearly basis. Despite this compelling figure, the model also suggests significant spatio-temporal variability in the vertical distribution of CO photoproduction in the subtropical gyres, where up to 40% of water-column CO can be produced below the mixed layer during summertime.
   While the approach can be applied to other photochemical fluxes (e.g. DIC formation or DMS removal), accurate quantification of such processes with remote sensing will be limited until the mechanisms regulating observed oceanic variability in the apparent quantum yields are better understood. Minor modification to this model can also make it applicable for the determination of the effects of UV and visible solar radiation on sensitive biological systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Vegetation mapping of plant communities at fine spatial scales is increasingly supported by remote sensing technology. However, combining ecological ground truth information and remote sensing datasets for mapping approaches is complicated by the complexity of ecological datasets. In this study, we present a new approach that uses high spatial resolution hyperspectral datasets to map vegetation units of a semiarid rangeland in Central Namibia. Field vegetation surveys provide the input to the workflow presented in this study. The collected data were classified by hierarchical cluster analysis into seven vegetation units that reflect different ecological states occurring in the study area. Spectral indices covering vegetation and soil characteristics were calculated from hyperspectral remote sensing imagery and used as environmental variables in a constrained ordination by applying redundancy analysis (RDA). The resulting statistical relationships between vegetation data and spectral indices were transferred into images of ordination axes, which were subsequently used in a supervised fuzzy c-means classification approach relying on a k-NN distance metric. Membership images for each vegetation unit as well as a confusion image of the classification result allowed a sound ecological interpretation of the resulting hard classification map. Classification results were validated with two independent reference datasets. For an internal and external validation dataset, overall accuracy reached 98% and 64% with kappa values of 0.98 and 0.53, respectively. Critical steps during the mapping workflow were highlighted and compared with similar mapping approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An aerosol retrieval algorithm for the first Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) to be launched in March 2010 onboard the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) is presented. The algorithm retrieves aerosol optical depth (AOD), fine-mode fraction (FMIF), and aerosol type in 500 m x 500 m resolution. All the products are retrieved over clear water which is defined by surface reflectance ratio between 640 nm and 860 nm (SRR) less or equal to 2.5, while only AOD is retrieved over turbid water (SRR>2.5) due to high surface reflectance. To develop optimized algorithm for the target area of GOCI, optical properties of aerosol are analyzed from extensive observation of AERONET sunphotometers to generate lookup table. Surface reflectance of turbid water is determined from 30-day composite of Rayleigh- and gas corrected reflectance. By applying the present algorithm to MODIS top-of-the atmosphere reflectance, three different aerosol cases dominated by anthropogenic aerosol contains black carbon (BC), dust, and non-absorbing aerosol are analyzed to test the algorithm. The algorithm retrieves AOD, and size information together with aerosol type which are consistent with results inferred by RGB image in a qualitative way. The comparison of the retrieved AOD with those of MODIS collection 5 and AERONET sunphotometer observations shows reliable results. Especially, the application of turbid water algorithm significantly increases the accuracy in retrieving AOD at Anmyon station. The sensitivity study between MODIS and GOCI instruments in terms of relative sensitivity and scattering angle shows promising applicability of the present algorithm to future GOCI measurements.

AB Satellite derived full resolution data on chlorophyll, water leaving radiance, sea surface temperature, as well as altimetry data are used to characterise the process of shelf-open sea exchange induced by an individual mesoscale eddy off the North West coast of the Black Sea in the summer 2005. The shelf edge front in the NW part of the Black Sea separates biologically productive and often eutrophicated shelf waters from the open sea waters. A large mesoscale eddy (diameter about 120 km) was formed away from the shelf front southwest of Crimean peninsula in the spring 2005. The eddy moved towards the shelf break and repeatedly attached itself to the shelf edge front causing its disturbance and formation of a cross-shelf jet and a Chl-a rich filament spiralling around the eddy periphery. The jet represented an important cross-shelf transport mechanism sustaining an average cross-frontal flux of shelf waters of 0.3 Sv over period of 40 days. The total transport of water in our case study was equivalent to 40% of the overall volume of water on the shelf. Formation of the filament significantly increased the length of contact between shelf and deep sea waters from 70 km at the base of filament to about 800 km along its sides, thus providing a highly efficient mixing mechanism.

AB We used fine-spatial resolution remotely sensed data combined with tree-ring parameters in order to assess and reconstruct disturbances. in mountain birch (Betula pubescens) forests caused by Epirrita autumnato (autumnal moth). Research was conducted in the area of Lake Tornetrisk in northern Sweden where we utilized five proxy parameters to detect insect outbreak events over the 19th and 20th centuries. Digital change detection was applied on three pairs of multi-temporal NDVI images from Landsat TM/ETM+ to detect significant reductions in the photosynthetic activity of forested areas during disturbed growing seasons. An image segmentation gap-fill procedure was developed in order to compensate missing scan lines in Landsat ETM+ "SLC-off" images. To account for a potential dependence of local outbreak levels on elevation, a digital elevation model was included in the defoliation recognition process. The resulting damage distribution map allowed for the assessment of outbreak intensity and distribution at the stand level and was combined with tree-ring data and historical documents to produce a multi-evidence outbreak detection. Defoliation events in the tree-ring data were recognized as significant deviations from temperature related growth.
   Our outbreak detection scheme allowed for the reconstruction of nine major insect outbreaks over the past two centuries. The reconstruction proved reliable but only robust for severe defoliation events. Low-intensity incidents were not captured. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Quantifying aboveground biomass in forest ecosystems is required for carbon stock estimation, aspects of forest management, and further developing a capacity for monitoring carbon stocks over time. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) systems, of all remote sensing technologies, have been demonstrated to yield the most accurate estimates of aboveground biomass for forested areas over a wide range of biomass values. However, these systems are limited by considerations including large data volumes and high costs. Within the constraints imposed by the nature of the satellite mission, the GeoScience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard ICESat has provided data conferring information regarding forest vertical structure for large areas at a low end user cost. GLAS data have been demonstrated to accurately estimate forest height and aboveground biomass especially well in topographically smooth areas with homogeneous forested conditions. However in areas with dense forests, high relief, or heterogeneous vegetation cover, GLAS waveforms are more complex and difficult to consistently characterize. We use airborne discrete return LiDAR data to simulate GLAS waveforms and to subsequently deconstruct coregistered GLAS waveforms into vegetation and ground returns. A series of waveform metrics was calculated and compared to topography and vegetation information gleaned from the airborne data. A model to estimate maximum relief directly from waveform metrics was developed with an R-2 of 0.76 (n = 110), and used for the classification of the maximum relief of the areas sensed by GLAS. Discriminant analysis was also conducted as an alternative classification technique. A model was also developed estimating forest canopy height from waveform metrics for all of the data (R-2 = 0.81, n = 110) and for the three separate relief classes: maximum relief 0-7 m (R-2 = 0.83, n = 44), maximum relief 7-15 m (R-2 = 0.88, n = 41) and maximum relief > 15 m (R-2 = 0.75, n = 25). The moderate relief class model yielded better predictions of forest height than the low relief class model which is attributed to the increasing variability of waveform metrics with terrain relief. The moderate relief class model also yielded better predictions than the high relief class model because of the mixing of vegetation and terrain signals in waveforms from high relief footprints. This research demonstrates that terrain can be accurately modeled directly from GLAS waveforms enabling the inclusion of terrain relief, on a waveform specific basis, as supplemental model input to improve estimates of canopy height.

AB Knowledge of the Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) in the Thermal Infrared (TIR: 8-12 mu m) part of the electromagnetic spectrum is essential to derive accurate Land Surface Temperatures (LSTs) from spaceborne TIR measurements. This study focuses on validation of the emissivity product in the North American ASTER Land Surface Emissivity Database (NAALSED) v2.0 - a mean seasonal, gridded emissivity product produced at 100 in spatial resolution using all Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) scenes from 2000 to 2008 over North America (http://emissivity.jpl.nasa.gov). The NAALSED emissivity product was validated over bare surfaces with laboratory measurements of sand samples collected at nine pseudo-invariant sand dune sites located in the western/southwestern USA. The nine sand dune sites cover a broad range of surface emissivities in the TIR. Results show that the absolute mean emissivity difference between NAALSED and the laboratory results for the nine validation sites and all five ASTER TIR bands was 0.016 (1.6%). This emissivity difference is equivalent to approximately a 1 K error in the land surface temperature for a material at 300 K in the TIR. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper presents a new automatic algorithm to derive optical snow grain size at 1 km resolution using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements. The retrieval is conceptually based on an analytical asymptotic radiative transfer model which predicts spectral bidirectional snow reflectance as a function of the grain size and ice absorption. The snow grains are modeled as fractal rather than spherical particles in order to account for their irregular shape. The analytical form of solution leads to an explicit and fast retrieval algorithm. The time series analysis of derived grain size shows a good sensitivity to snow melting and snow precipitation events. Pre-processing is performed by a Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, which includes gridding MODIS data to 1 km resolution, water vapor retrieval, cloud masking and an atmospheric correction. MAIAC cloud mask is a new algorithm based on a time series of gridded MODIS measurements and an image-based rather than pixel-based processing. Extensive processing of MODIS TERRA data over Greenland shows a robust discrimination of clouds over bright snow and ice. Because in-situ grain size measurements over Greenland were not available at the time of this work, the validation was performed using data of Aoki et al. (Aoki, T., Hori, M., Motoyoshi, H.. Tanikawa, T., Hachikubo, A., Sugiura, K., et al. (2007). ADEOS-II/GLI snow/ice products - Part II: Validation results using GLI and MODIS data. Remote Sensing of Environment, 111, 274-290) collected at Barrow (Alaska, USA), and Saroma, Abashiri and Nakashibetsu (Japan) in 2001-2005. The retrievals correlate well with measurements in the range of radii similar to 0.1-1 mm, although retrieved optical diameter may be about a factor of 1.5 lower than the physical measured diameter. As part of validation analysis for Greenland, the derived grain size from MODIS over selected sites in 2004 was compared to the microwave brightness temperature measurements of SSM/I radiometer which is sensitive to the amount of liquid water in the snowpack. The comparison showed a good qualitative agreement, with both datasets detecting two main periods of snowmelt. Additionally, MODIS grain size was compared with predictions of the snow model CROCUS driven by measurements of the automatic weather stations of the Greenland Climate Network. We found that the MODIS value is on average a factor of two smaller than CROCUS grain size. This result agrees with the direct validation analysis indicating that the snow reflectance model may need a "calibration" factor of similar to 1.5 for the retrieved grain size to match the physical snow grain size. Overall, the agreement between CROCUS and MODIS results was satisfactory, in particular before and during the first melting period in mid June. Following detailed time series analysis of snow grain size for four permanent sites, the paper presents maps of this important parameter over the Greenland ice sheet for the March-September period of 2004.

AB The shortwave infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, covering wavelengths from 1400 to 2500 nm, can include significant emitted radiance from fire. There have been relatively few evaluations of the utility of shortwave infrared remote sensing data, and in particular hyperspectral remote sensing data, for fire detection. We used an Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) scene acquired over the 2003 Simi Fire to identify the hyperspectral index that was able to most accurately detect pixels containing fire. All AVIRIS band combinations were used to calculate normalized difference indices, and kappa was used to compare classification ability of these indices for three different fire temperature ranges. The most accurate index was named the Hyperspectral Fire Detection Index (HFDI). The HFDI uses shortwave infrared bands centered at 2061 and 2429 nm. These bands are sensitive to atmospheric attenuation, so the impacts of variable elevation, solar zenith angle, and atmospheric water vapor concentration on HFDI were assessed using radiative transfer modeling. While varying these conditions did affect HFDI values, relative differences between background HFDI and HFDI for 1% fire pixel coverage were maintained. HFDI is most appropriate for detection of flaming combustion, and may miss lower temperature smoldering combustion at low percent pixel coverage due to low emitted radiance in the shortwave infrared. HFDI, two previously proposed hyperspectral fire detection indices, and a broadband shortwave infrared-based fire detection index were applied to AVIRIS scenes acquired over the 2007 Zaca Fire and 2008 Indians Fire. A qualitative comparison of the indices demonstrated that HFDI provides improved detection of fire with less variability in background index values. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing has considerable potential for providing accurate, up-to-date information in urban areas. Urban remote sensing is complicated, however, by very high spectral and spatial complexity. In this paper, Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was applied to map urban land cover using HyMap data acquired over the city of Bonn, Germany. MESMA is well suited for urban environments because it allows the number and types of endmembers to vary on a per-pixel basis, which allows controlling the large spectral variability in these environments. We employed a hierarchical approach, in which MESMA was applied to map four levels of complexity ranging from the simplest level consisting of only two classes, impervious and pervious, to 20 classes that differentiated material composition and plant species. Lower levels of complexity, mapped at the highest accuracies, were used to constrain spatially models at higher levels of complexity, reducing spectral confusion between materials. A spectral library containing 1521 endmembers was created from the HyMap data. Three endmember selection procedures, Endmember Average RMS (EAR), Minimum Average Spectral Angle (MASA) and Count Based Endmember Selection (COB), were used to identify the most representative endmembers for each level of complexity. Combined two-, three- or four-endmember models - depending on the hierarchical level - were applied, and the highest endmember fractions were used to assign a land cover class. Classification accuracies of 97.2% were achieved for the two lowest complexity levels, consisting of impervious and pervious classes, and a four class map consisting of vegetation, bare soil, water and built-up. At the next level of complexity, consisting of seven classes including trees, grass, bare soil, river, lakes/basins, road and roof/building, classification accuracies remained high at 81.7% with most classes mapped above 85% accuracy. At the highest level, consisting of 20 land cover classes, a 75.9% classification accuracy was achieved. The ability of MESMA to incorporate within-class spectral variability, combined with a hierarchical approach that uses spatial information from one level to constrain model selection at a higher level of complexity was shown to be particularly well suited for urban environments.

AB The exurbanization process, particularly rural residential development, is reducing the amount of roadless areas and remote habitat across the nation, with implications for biodiversity and ecosystem integrity of parks and protected areas. The need for connecting protected areas via existing habitat centers, or relatively undisturbed core areas, is greater than ever as exurbanization expands. Our objective was to make use of nationally available data sets on roads as well as information derived from satellite imagery, including impervious cover of the built environment and forest canopy density, to identify core habitat of the northeastern and mid-Atlantic USA. The identified core habitat areas, which covered 73,730 km(2) across 1177 discrete units, were stratified in terms of land ownership and management, and then analyzed in a landscape context using connectivity metrics derived from graph theory. The connectivity analysis made use of a suitability surface, derived from the land cover information, which approximated the costs incurred by hypothetical animals traversing the landscape. We show that protected areas are frequently identified as core habitat but are typically isolated, albeit sometimes buffered by adjacent multi-use lands (such as state or national forests). Over one third of the core habitat we identified has no protection, and another 42% is subject to motorized recreation or timber extraction. We provide maps showing the relative importance of core habitat areas for potentially connecting existing protected areas, and also provide an example of the vulnerability of connectivity to projected future residential development around one greater park ecosystem.

AB Forest disturbances influence many landscape processes, including changes in microclimate, hydrology, and soil erosion. We analyzed the spectral response and temporal progress of two types of disturbances of spruce forest (bark beetle outbreak and clear-cuts) in the central part of Sumava Mountains at the border between the Czech Republic and Germany, Central Europe. The bark beetle (Ips typographus [L]) outbreak in this region in the last 20 years resulted in regional-scale spruce forest decay. Clear-cutting was done here to prevent further bark-beetle propagation in the buffer zones.
   The aim of the study is to identify the differences in spectral response between the two types of forest disturbances and their temporal dynamics. General trends were analyzed throughout the study area, with sampled disturbance areas selected to assess the relationship between field vegetation data and their spectral response. Thirteen Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes from 1985 to 2007 were used for the assessment. The following spectral indices were estimated: NDMI, Tasseled Cap (Brightness, Greenness, Wetness), DI, and DI'. The DI', Wetness, and Brightness indices show the highest sensitivity to forest disturbance for both disturbance types (clear-cuts and bark beetle outbreak). The multitemporal analysis distinguished three different stages of development. The highest spectral differences between the clear-cuts and the bark beetle disturbances were found in the period between 1996 and 2004 with increased levels of forest disturbance (repeated measures ANOVA, Scheffe post hoc test; p <= 0.05). Clear-cut disturbance resulted in significantly higher spectral differences from the original forest and occurred as a more discrete event in comparison to bark beetle outbreak.

AB The theory of spectral invariants, or 'p-theory', states that the canopy scattering coefficient at any wavelength can be related to the leaf scattering coefficient at the same wavelength through a spectrally invariant canopy structural parameter - the photon recollision probability p. The p-theory has recently gained interest in the vegetation reflectance modeling community as an efficient tool for characterizing scattering in clumped foliage structures. In this short communication paper, we report empirical data of the relationship of canopy leaf area index (LAI), diffuse non-interceptance and photon recollision probability for 1032 coniferous and broadleaved forest plots measured in Finland. Our results indicate that the relationship of canopy LAI and diffuse non-interceptance is near-universal in boreal stands i.e. it does not depend on stand age, tree species or growth conditions. This allows improving parameterizations used by canopy reflectance models which utilize the photon recollision probability concept. Our results also suggest that establishing species-specific p-LAI functions for northern European forests requires more research on the influence of micro- and macroscale foliage grouping on photon recollision probability.

AB Variation in the foliar chemistry of humid tropical forests is poorly understood, and airborne imaging spectroscopy could provide useful information at leaf and canopy scales. However, variation in canopy structure affects our ability to estimate foliar properties from airborne spectrometer data, yet these structural affects remain poorly quantified. Using leaf spectral (400-2500 nm) and chemical data collected from 162 Australian tropical forest species, along with partial least squares (PLS) analysis and canopy radiative transfer modeling, we determined the strength of the relationship between canopy reflectance and foliar properties under conditions of varying canopy structure.
   At the leaf level, chlorophylls, carotenoids and specific leaf area (SLA) were highly correlated with leaf spectral reflectance (r=0.90-0.91). Foliar nutrients and water were also well represented by the leaf spectra (r=0.79-0.85). When the leaf spectra were incorporated into the canopy radiative transfer simulations with an idealistic leaf area index (LAI)=5.0, correlations between canopy reflectance spectra and leaf properties increased in strength by 4-18%. The effects of random LAI (=3.0-6.5) variation on the retrieval of leaf Properties remained minimal, particularly for pigments and SLA (r=0.92-0.93). In contrast, correlations between leaf nitrogen (N) and canopy reflectance estimates decreased from r=0.87 at constant LAI=5 to r=0.65 with randomly varying LAI=3.0-6.5. Progressive increases in the structural variability among simulated tree crowns had relatively little effect on pigment, SLA and water predictions. However, N and phosphorus (P) were more sensitive to canopy structural variability. Our modeling results suggest that multiple leaf chemicals and SLA can be estimated from leaf and canopy reflectance spectroscopy, and that the high-LAI canopies found in tropical forests enhance the signal via multiple scattering. Finally, the two factors we found to most negatively impact leaf chemical predictions from canopy reflectance were variation in LAI and viewing geometry, which can be managed with new airborne technologies and analytical methods.

AB The role of coastal seas as either a sink or a source of CO2 is subject to a great deal of uncertainty. This uncertainty largely arises from a lack of observations in the coastal zones. Remote sensing offers an avenue for expanding these observations by allowing for the extrapolation of relatively limited data sets of dissolved CO2 (pCO(2sw)). In this paper, predictive algorithms for PCO2sw that could be applied to remote sensing products were created from a field data set collected from September-October, 2005 in Hudson Bay, Canada. The field data showed that an effective PCO2sw interpolation algorithm could be created using sea surface temperature (SST) as a predictor, and that a slight improvement of the algorithm could be achieved if measurements of absorption due to Coloured dissolved organic material (a(CDOM)) were included. Unfortunately, satellite retrievals of a(CDOM) did not match well with in situ observations, and so only SST (obtained from the MODIS Aqua sensor) was used to create monthly Maps of PCO2sw for the period of August-October. To estimate fluxes of CO2, Constructed surfaces of PCO2sw were combined with estimates of as transfer velocity derived from QuikSCAT wind retrievals, and PCO2air based on field observations. The results of these calculations revealed that Hudson Bay acts as a source of CO2 during August and September, but reverts to a sink of CO2 in October as the water temperature decreases. Overall, a positive flux of 1.60 TgC was estimated for the region during the ice-free season. This result is in contrast to most Arctic or sub-Arctic continental shelf seas, where usually strong absorptions of CO2 are observed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the single scattering optical properties of snow for different ice particle shapes and degrees of microscopic scale roughness. These optical properties were implemented and tested in a coupled atmosphere-snow radiative transfer model. The modeled surface spectral albedo and radiance distribution were compared with surface measurements. The results Show that the reflected radiance and irradiance over snow are sensitive to the snow grain size and its vertical profile. When inhomogeneity of the particle size distribution in the vertical is taken into account, the measured spectral albedo can be matched, regardless of the particle shapes. But this is not true for the modeled radiance distribution, which depends a lot on the particle shape. The usual "equivalent spheres" assumption significantly overestimates forward reflected radiances, and underestimates backscattering radiances, around the principal plane. Oil average, the aggregate shape assumption has the best agreement with the measured radiances to a mean bias within 2%. The snow optical properties with the aggregate assumption were applied to the retrieval of snow grain size over the Antarctic plateau. The retrieved grain sizes of the top layer showed similar and large seasonal variation in all years, but only small year to year variation. Using the retrieved snow grain sizes, the modeled spectral and broadband radiances showed good agreements with MODIS and CERES measurements over the Antarctic plateau. Except for the MODIS 2.13 mu m channel, the mean relative model-observation differences are within few percent. The modeled MODIS radiances using measured surface reflectance at Dome C also showed good agreement in visible channels, where radiation is not sensitive to snow grain size and the measured Surface bidirectional reflectance is applicable Over the Antarctic plateau. But modeled radiances using local, surface-measured reflectance in the near infrared yielded large errors because of the high sensitivity to the snow grain size, which varies spatially and temporally. The CERES broadband shortwave radiance is moderately sensitive to the snow grain size, comparable to the MODIS 0.86 mu m channel. The variation of broadband snow reflectance due to the season a I variation in snow grain size is about 5% in a year over the Antarctic plateau. CERES broadband radiances simulated with grain sizes retrieved using MODIS are about 2% larger than those observed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a new technique to analyze L-band signals of the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) that have rebounded off the sea surface, with the aim of retrieving information about surface roughness in the form of the effective Probability Density Function (PDF) of the slopes. Unlike earlier techniques, which parameterize the PDF (usually as normal bivariate distributions), this approach does not constrain the surface slopes' PDF to the shape of a particular analytical distribution. This may help to understand the real information content of L-band scattered signals, which is currently unclear. After validating the algorithm by means of end-to-end simulations, we have applied it to real data. The tests on real data show that the retrievals are robust, consistent with the results obtained with standard GNSS-reflection techniques, and in agreement with independent sources of information. Moreover, the retrieved slopes' PDF present non-Gaussian features, such as skewness. A more in-depth analysis to check whether the skewness is a geophysical signature or an artifact of the technique, shows that it maps with the up-/down-asymmetries introduced by surface forces. In particular, this is the first time that GNSS-reflections have sensed and identified the up- and down-wind signature on the surface, putting and end to the 180 degrees ambiguity that was usually attributed to GNSS observations of directional roughness.

AB Burned area is a critical input to the algorithms of biomass burning emissions and understanding variability in fire activity due to climate change but it is difficult to estimate. This study presents a robust algorithm to reconstruct the patterns in burned areas across Contiguous United States (CONUS) in diurnal, seasonal, and interannual scales from 2000-2006. Specifically, burned areas in individual fire pixels are empirically calculated using diurnal variations in instantaneous fire sizes from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) WF_ABBA (Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm) fire product. GOES burned areas exhibit diurnal variability with a temporal scale of half hours. The cumulative burned area during 9:00-16:00 local solar time accounts for 65%-81% of the total daily burned area. The diurnal variability is strongest in croplands compared to shrublands, grasslands, savannas, and forests. Analysis on a seasonal scale indicates that over 56% of burning occurs during summer (June-August). On average, the total annual burned area during the last seven years is 2.12 x 10(4) +/- 0.41 x 10(4) km(2). The algorithm developed in this study can be applied to obtain burned area from the detections of GOES active fires at near real time, which can greatly improve the estimates of biomass burning emissions needed for predicting air quality.

AB Proper estimation of initial state variables and model parameters are vital importance for determining the accuracy of numerical model prediction. In this work, we develop a one-dimensional land data assimilation scheme based on ensemble Kalman filter and Common Land Model version 3.0 (CoLM). This scheme is used to improve the estimation of soil temperature profile. The leaf area index (LAI) is also updated dynamically by MODIS LAI production and the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) products are assimilated into CoLM. The scheme was tested and validated by observations from four automatic weather stations (BTS, DRS, MGS, and DGS) in Mongolian Reference Site of CEOP during the period of October 1, 2002 to September 30, 2003. Results indicate that data assimilation improves the estimation of soil temperature profile about 1 K. In comparison with simulation, the assimilation results of soil heat fluxes also have much improvement about 13 W m(-2) at BTS and DGS and 2 W m(-2) at DRS and MGS, respectively. In addition, assimilation of MODIS land products into land surface model is a practical and effective way to improve the estimation of land surface variables and fluxes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Vegetation water content is an important parameter for retrieval of soil moisture from microwave data and for other remote sensing applications. Because liquid water absorbs in the shortwave infrared, the normalized difference infrared index (NDII), calculated from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper band 4 (0.76-0.90 mu m wavelength) and band 5 (1.55-1.65 mu m wavelength), can be used to determine canopy equivalent water thickness (EWT), which is defined as the water volume per leaf area times the leaf area index (LAI). Alternatively, average canopy EWT can be determined using a landcover classification, because different vegetation types have different average LAI at the peak of the growing season. The primary contribution of this study for the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 was to sample vegetation for the Axizona and Sonora study areas. Vegetation was sampled to achieve a range of canopy EWT; LAI was measured using a plant canopy analyzer and digital hemispherical (fisheye) photographs. NDII was linearly related to measured canopy EWT with an R-2 of 0.601. Landcover of the Arizona, USA, and Sonora, Mexico, study areas were classified with an overall accuracy of 70% using a rule-based decision tree using three dates of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery and digital elevation data. There was a large range of NDII per landcover class at the peak of the growing season, indicating that canopy EWT should be estimated directly using NDII or other shortwave-infrared vegetation indices. However, landcover classifications will still be necessary to obtain total vegetation water content from canopy EWT and other data, because considerable liquid water is contained in the non-foliar components of vegetation.

AB The Ayora region, situated about 60 km southwest of the city of Valencia/Spain, was chosen to demonstrate pathways of characterizing fire events and post-fire succession in Mediterranean ecosystems using multi-temporal satellite imagery. A corresponding time series of 6 Landsat MSS, 13 Landsat-5 TM and 1 Landsat-7 ETM+images, covering the period 1975-2000, was processed to account for geometric and radiometric distortions as well as sensor calibration. Spectral Mixture Analysis was applied to derive estimates of photosynthetic active green vegetation cover as a primary indicator.
   A combination of pixel-based linear trend analysis and diachronic thresholding was employed to procure a fire perimeter data base and characterize post-fire dynamics based on a temporally stratified trend analysis. The results were integrated with auxiliary information to evaluate driving factors and further interpreted in relation to field-based information on plant communities and post-fire succession patterns.
   Reflecting typical recovery phases with an initial establishment of grasses and herbaceous species, followed by a gradual development of a shrub layer and the subsequent colonization of tree individuals, temporal trajectories could be described by exponential functions and were related to plot-based botanical information.

AB The objective of this research is to develop a global remote sensing evapotranspiration (ET) algorithm based on Cleugh et al.'s [Cleugh, H.A., R. Leuning, Q. Mu, S.W. Running (2007) Regional evaporation estimates from flux tower and MODIS satellite data. Remote Sensing of Environment 106, page 285-304- 2007 (doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2006.07.007).] Penman-Monteith based ET (RS-PM). Our algorithm considers both the surface energy partitioning process and environmental constraints on ET. We use ground-based meteorological observations and remote sensing data from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate global ET by (1) adding vapor pressure deficit and minimum air temperature constraints on stomatal conductance; (2) using leaf area index as a scalar for estimating canopy conductance; (3) replacing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index with the Enhanced Vegetation Index thereby also changing the equation for calculation of the vegetation cover fraction (F-C); and (4) adding a calculation of soil evaporation to the previously proposed RS-PM method.
   We evaluate our algorithm using ET observations at 19 AmeriFlux eddy covariance flux towers. We calculated ET with both our Revised RS-PM algorithm and the RS-PM algorithm using Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO v. 4.0.0) meteorological data and compared the resulting ET estimates with observations. Results indicate that our Revised RS-PM algorithm substantially reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) of the 8-day latent heat flux (LE) averaged over the 19 towers from 64.6 W/m(2) (RS-PM algorithm) to 27.3 W/m(2) (Revised RS-PM) with tower meteorological data, and from 71.9 W/m(2) to 29.5 W/m(2) with GMAO meteorological data. The average LE bias of the tower-driven LE estimates to the LE observations changed from 39.9 W/m(2) to - 5.8 W/m(2) and from 48.2 W/m(2) to - 1.3 W/m(2) driven by GMAO data. The correlation coefficients increased slightly from 0.70 to 0.76 with the use of tower meteorological data. We then apply our Revised RS-PM algorithm to the globe using 0.05 degrees MODIS remote sensing data and reanalysis meteorological data to obtain the annual global ET (MODIS ET) for 2001. As expected, the spatial pattern of the MODIS ET agrees well with that of the MODIS global terrestrial gross and net primary production (MOD17 GPP/NPP), with the highest ET over tropical forests and the lowest ET values in dry areas with short growing seasons. This MODIS ET product provides critical information on the regional and global water cycle and resulting environment changes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing based on active and passive microwave data represents a useful tool for studying the state of the cryosphere at high temporal resolution and large spatial scale. In particular, retrieving snow parameters from space-borne data can benefit hydrological, meteorological, and climatological applications. In this paper, we analyze the trend of Ku band backscatter coefficients measured by the NASA's Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) and K and Ka band brightness temperatures measured by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) with respect to snow depth values at different locations in the Northern hemisphere during the period 1999-2004. We also quantify, for the first time, the dynamic range of space-borne Ku band scatterometer data over snow covered areas at very large spatial scale in comparison to the range in passive microwave brightness temperatures. Also for the first time, we quantify the improvement on the snow depth retrieval related to the combined use of active and passive data and compare the results with those obtained using either only active or passive data. Finally, we report first results regarding an analysis involving X-band brightness temperatures, collected by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), aiming at understanding whether the improvements derived from using a combination of active and passive data are related to the use of a low frequency or to the different techniques used (e.g., active or passive).

AB A method is developed for monitoring the sediment grain-size of intertidal flats in the Westerschelde (southwest Netherlands), using information from both space-borne microwave (SAR) and optical/shortwave infrared remote sensing. Estimates of the backscattering coefficient were extracted from time-series of C-band ERS SAR imagery. Surface reflectance in the visible, near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) part of the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as spectral indices, were derived from matching multi-temporal Landsai TM imagery. In addition, surface reflectances were derived from a set of airborne multispectral (VNIR) CASI images, and hyperspectral (VNIR) measurements using a field spectroradiometer. The data were related to matching field measurements of surface characteristics, including sediment properties. Regression-based algorithms were developed to map the spatio-temporal distribution of mud content using (a) the C-band SAR backscattering coefficient, (b) surface reflectance in the green and SWIR, and (c) a combination of these, with corroborative field measurements: Mud content of the sediment has been successfully mapped by all three algorithms, but a combination of information from microwave and VNIR/SWIR provided best results. The algorithms were generally consistent in time, making them suitable for generating time-series and for monitoring. However, they should be validated and calibrated in order to be applicable to other intertidal areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spatially distributed air temperature data with high temporal resolution are desired for several modeling applications. By exploiting the thermal split window channels in combination with the red and near infrared channels of the geostationary MSG SEVIRI sensor, multiple daily air temperature estimates can be achieved using the contextual temperature-vegetation index method. Air temperature was estimated for 436 image acquisitions during the 2005 rainy season over West Africa and evaluated against in situ data from a field test site in Dahra, Northern Senegal. The methodology was adjusted using data from the test site resulting in RMSE=2.55 K, MBE=-0.30 K and R-2=0.63 for the estimated versus observed air temperatures. A spatial validation of the method using 12 synoptic weather stations from Senegal and Mali within the Senegal River basin resulted in overall values of RMSE=2.96 K, MBE=-1.11 K and R-2=0.68. The daytime temperature curve is interpolated using a sine function based on the multiple daily air temperature estimates from the SEVIRI data. These estimates (covering the 8:00-20:00 UCT time window) were in good agreement with observed values with RMSE=2.99 K, MBE=-0.70 K and R-2=0.64. The temperature-vegetation index method was applied as a moving window technique to produce distributed maps of air temperature with 15 min intervals and 3 km spatial resolution for application in a distributed hydrological model.

AB The Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation is the first geostationary satellite instrument with all visual and infrared channels that are important for snow mapping. In this paper, we present an algorithm for deriving snow cover maps from SEVIRI data that makes use of the unique combination of adequate spectral resolution and very high frequency. The short interval of 15 min between images makes it possible to extend traditional spectral classification with a detection of changes between images. This improves the detection of clouds and cloud shadows in instantaneous images, because these often display more variation in time than the surface. It therefore allows a more accurate mapping of surface snow cover, as is shown by a validation of the results with ground observations and other satellite data. The accurate classification of each single image allows the generation of temporal composite snow maps in near real-time, which is for example of interest for numerical weather prediction models. When compared to many in situ measurements from the winter of 2005/2006, the accuracy of the algorithm is 95%. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The global environmental change research community requires improved and up-to-date land use/land cover (LULC) datasets at regional to global scales to support a variety of science and policy applications. Considerable strides have been made to improve large-area LULC datasets, but little emphasis has been placed on thematically detailed crop mapping, despite the considerable influence of management activities in the cropland sector on various environmental processes and the economy. Time-series MODIS 250 in Vegetation Index (VI) datasets hold considerable promise for large-area crop mapping in an agriculturally intensive region such as the U.S. Central Great Plains, given their global coverage, intermediate spatial resolution, high temporal resolution (16-day composite period), and cost-free status. However, the specific spectral-temporal information contained in these data has yet to be thoroughly explored and their applicability for large-area crop-related LULC classification is relatively unknown. The objective of this research was to investigate the general applicability of the time-series MODIS 250 in Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets for crop-related LULC classification in this region. A combination of graphical and statistical analyses were performed on a 12-month time-series of MODIS EVI and NDVI data from more than 2000 cropped field sites across the U.S. state of Kansas. Both MODIS VI datasets were found to have sufficient spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions to detect unique multi-temporal signatures for each of the region's major crop types (alfalfa, com, sorghum, soybeans, and winter wheat) and management practices (double crop, fallow, and irrigation). Each crop's multi-temporal VI signature was consistent with its general phenological characteristics and most crop classes were spectrally separable at some point during the growing season. Regional intra-class VI signature variations were found for some crops across Kansas that reflected the state's climate and planting time differences. The multi-temporal EVI and NDVI data tracked similar seasonal responses for all crops and were highly correlated across the growing season. However, differences between EVI and NDVI responses were most pronounced during the senescence phase of the growing season. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper compares the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and percent impervious surface as indicators of surface urban heat island effects in Landsat imagery by investigating the relationships between the land surface temperature (LST), percent impervious surface area (%ISA), and the NDVI. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data were used to estimate the LST from four different seasons for the Twin Cities, Minnesota, metropolitan area. A map of percent impervious surface with a standard error of 7.95% was generated using a normalized spectral mixture analysis of July 2002 Landsat TM imagery. Our analysis indicates there is a strong linear relationship between LST and percent impervious surface for all seasons, whereas the relationship between LST and NDVI is much less strong and varies by season. This result suggests percent impervious surface provides a cornplementary metric to the traditionally applied NDVI for analyzing LST quantitatively over the seasons for surface urban heat island studies using thermal infrared remote sensing in an urbanized environment.

AB The monitoring of earth surface dynamic processes requires global observations of the structure and the functioning of vegetation. Moderate resolution sensors (with pixel size ranging from 250 in to 7 km) provide frequent estimates of biophysical variables to characterize vegetation such as the leaf area index (LAI). However, the computation of LAI from moderate resolution remote sensing data induces a scaling bias on the LAI estimate if the moderate resolution pixel is heterogeneous and if the transfer function that relates remote sensing data to LAI is non-linear.
   This study provides a model to evaluate and correct the scaling bias. The model is built first for a univariate semi-empirical transfer function relating LAI directly to NDVI. The scaling bias is a function of (i) the degree of non-linearity of the transfer function quantified by its second derivative and (ii) the spatial heterogeneity of the moderate resolution pixel quantified by the variogram of the high spatial resolution (20 in) NDVI image. Then, the model is extended to a bivariate transfer function where LAI is related to red and near infrared reflectances.
   The scaling bias depends on (i) the Hessian matrix of the transfer function and (ii) the variograms and cross variogram of the red and near infrared reflectances. The scaling bias is investigated on several distinct landscapes from the VALERI database. Adjusting for scaling bias is critical on crop sites which are the most heterogeneous sites at the landscape level. Regarding the univariate transfer function, the magnitude of the scaling bias increases rapidly with pixel size until this size is larger than the typical spatial scale of the data. For the bivariate transfer function, it results from the addition of several components that may add up or cancel each other out. It is thus more difficult to analyze.
   The accuracy of the model to estimate the scaling bias is discussed. It depends mainly on the ability of the variograms and cross variogram to represent the local dispersion variances and covariance within the moderate resolution pixel. The model is generally highly accurate at 1000 in spatial resolution for the univariate transfer function and less accurate for the bivariate transfer function. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Gridding artifacts between observations and predefined grid cells strongly influence the local spatial properties of MODIS images. The sensor observation in any grid cell is only partially derived from the location of the cell, with the average overlap between observations and their grid cells being less than 30%. This mismatch between grid cells and observations has strong implications for the use of reference data for the validation of MODIS products or the training of MODIS algorithms. When generating multidate composites, gridding artifacts introduce bias when spectral compositing criteria are used. Also, results indicate that the ability to generate consistent long-term remote sensing records is dependent on both consistent sensing scenarios (spectral bands, view angle distributions, geolocation error) as well as consistent compositing approaches. The band-to-band registration for the different spatial resolutions of gridded MODIS data can be poor if the different resolutions of data are gridded before aggregation. In all cases it is imprecise to characterize the subpixel properties of the coarser resolution bands using the finer resolution bands due to poor correspondence in the areas from which the observations are derived. All of the band-to-band registration problems are minimized when the MODIS data are aggregated to coarser resolutions. When validating algorithm accuracy, available data on the observation dimensions and the offsets between the grid cell and the observation should be included to ensure the quality of validation results. If this information is not available, MODIS data should be aggregated to coarser resolutions to improve the correspondence between the location of observations and grid cells. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB A prototype product suite, containing the Terra 8-day, Aqua 8-day, Terra-Aqua combined 8- and 4-day products, was generated as part of testing for the next version (Collection 5) of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI) products. These products were analyzed for consistency between Terra and Aqua retrievals over the following data subsets in North America: single 8-day composite over the whole continent and annual time series over three selected MODIS tiles (1200 X 1200 km). The potential for combining retrievals from the two sensors to derive improved products by reducing the impact of environmental conditions and temporal compositing period was also explored. The results suggest no significant discrepancies between large area (from continent to MODIS tile) averages of the Terra and Aqua 8-day LAI and surface reflectances products. The differences over smaller regions, however, can be large due to the random nature of residual atmospheric effects. High quality retrievals from the radiative transfer based algorithm can be expected in 90-95% of the pixels with mostly herbaceous cover and about 50-75% of the pixels with woody vegetation during the growing season. The quality of retrievals during the growing season is mostly restricted by aerosol contamination of the MODIS data. The Terra-Aqua combined 8-day product helps to minimize this effect and increases the number of high quality retrievals by 10-20% over woody vegetation. The combined 8-day product does not improve the number of high quality retrievals during the winter period because the extent of snow contamination of Terra and Aqua observations is similar. Likewise, cloud contamination in the single-sensor and combined products is also similar. The LAI magnitudes, seasonal profiles and retrieval quality in the combined 4-day product are comparable to those in the single-sensor 8-day products. Thus, the combined 4-day product doubles the temporal resolution of the seasonal cycle, which facilitates phenology monitoring in application studies during vegetation transition periods. Both Terra and Aqua LAI products show anomalous seasonality in boreal needle leaf forests, due to limitations of the radiative transfer algorithm to model seasonal variations of MODIS surface reflectance data with respect to solar zenith angle. Finally, this study suggests that further improvement of the MODIS LAI products is mainly restricted by the accuracy of the MODIS observations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Guided by radiative transfer modelling of the effects of Saharan dust (aerosol) on brightness temperatures at 3.9, 8.7, 11 and 12 lam measured by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), we propose an indicator of the presence of Saharan dust in nighttime (infrared-only) SEVIRI imagery. Radiative transfer modelling is performed using a fast atmospheric transmittance model and a delta-Eddington approximation for scattering. Using aerosol single scattering properties appropriate to simulation of Saharan dust gives qualitatively good simulations of dust-affected brightness temperatures. From these simulations, we show that aerosol-free brightness temperatures are tightly clustered around the principal axis (explaining 99% of variance) in a 3-dimensional brightness-temperature difference space (the axes being 3.9 mu m minus 8.7 mu m, 3.9 mu m minus 12 mu m, and 11 mu m minus 12 mu m); in contrast, brightness temperatures affected by aerosol are simulated to be significantly off-axis when transformed into this space. Although the detailed effects of aerosol on brightness temperatures are not quantitatively reproduced by our simulations, this off-axis characteristic is empirically found to be also true of Saharan-dust-affected brightness temperatures in observations. The second principal component of the brightness-temperature difference space is identified as a useful index for Saharan dust. Comparisons with independent satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD, at 0.55 mu m) show that the new Saharan dust index (SDI) is loosely correlated with AOD (r=0.34). The correlation is loose because the SDI is also sensitive to the height distribution of aerosol, which affects the aerosol's thermal emission. The SDI is used to develop an empirical correction scheme for SST retrievals affected by Saharan dust. Application of the SDI correction scheme removes an independent error of 0.2 K from SEVIRI SSTs validated against buoys from all latitudes. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID INFORMATION
AB To improve wind erosion model calculations across several spatial and temporal scales simultaneously, there is a requirement for a noninvasive approach that can be used rapidly to assess changes in the compositional and structural nature of a soil surface in time and space. Remote sensing allows consideration of the processes controlling erodibility on the same spatial continuum to avoid time-consuming and expensive fieldwork. Multi-angular spectral reflectance appears to provide a holistic framework for the measurement and calculation of soil surface characteristics remotely using ground-based radiometers and current and future generations of angular sensors on airborne and satellite platforms. To investigate the utility of this framework, a ground-based study was performed using three soils susceptible to wind erosion that were modified using rainfall simulation and wind tunnel abrasion experiments. Measurements of those changes were made and recorded using digital images. Multi-angular spectral measurements of reflectance were also made and inverted against a bi-directional soil spectral reflectance model. Comparison of the measurements and calculations showed good agreement with small errors in accuracy. Optimised values of the model parameters produced the single scattering albedo and a description of the reflectance scattering behaviour of the soil surfaces that included an estimate of roughness. The model parameters removed the effect of illumination and viewing geometry on the spectral reflectance. The combination of single-scattering albedo spectra and model parameters for each treatment provided information about the composition and structure of the soil surface changes. The main changes detected at the soil surface included the presence of a crust produced by rain-splash, the production of loose erodible material covering a rain crust and the selective erosion of the soil surface. Redundancy analysis showed that much of the variation in the values of the soil reflectance model parameters was explained by the scattering properties and the roughness parameter of the soil surfaces. Variation in the soil surface reflectance was not explained solely by soil type. Instead, low intensity rainfall combined with short and long duration abrasion explained a significant portion. These findings provide a source of considerable variation in experimental and operational spectral reflectance measurements that has perhaps hitherto been largely ignored. The results demonstrated the readily available information on the composition and structure of the soil surface without interfering with natural processes. The directional soil reflectance methodology appears to have potential for use in improving the understanding of erodibility and ultimately for identifying and quantifying soil erosion.

AB An extensive set of in situ temperature data collected by surface drifters is combined with satellite-derived sea surface temperature images to study the difference between the pseudo-bulk and bulk temperatures (Delta Trb-b) in the Adriatic Sea for the period 21 September 2002-31 December 2003. The variations of this temperature difference are described as a function of local wind speed and incoming solar radiation provided by a local area atmospheric model. The daily sea surface temperature variability is also assessed by computing the temperature difference between the daily maximal and minimal values (Delta Tday-night). The data show that the smaller the wind speed and the larger the solar radiation, the larger Delta Tpb-b. The temperature difference reached the highest value (similar to 5 degrees C) on a hot day (more than 600 W/m(2)) of May 2003 in weak wind condition (around 3 m/s). For strong winds (speed > 6 m/s) the dependence on both the wind and solar radiations vanishes as the temperature difference approaches zero because the near-surface water becomes thermally homogenous due to the wind-induced vertical mixing. Strong diurnal warming of the sea surface, as derived by the pseudo-bulk estimates, and a strong near-surface stratification were found during the spring/summer season. Monthly mean statistics show that the diurnal cycle of the pseudo-bulk and bulk temperature starts to become significant already in February and March. Subsequently (from April to August) both the diurnal warming and the stratification are maximal (monthly means of Delta Tday-nigh, similar to 1-2 degrees C and of Delta Tpb-b similar to 0.5 degrees C), while in fall and early winter the Delta Tpb-b values are quite small (monthly means near 0 degrees C) and the Delta Tday-night monthly means are bounded by 0.5-1.5 degrees C. Maximal amplitudes of the diurnal cycle can exceed 4 degrees C (mostly in spring-summer) for both the pseudo-bulk and bulk temperatures. However, the monthly means Of Delta Tday-night is generally twice as large for the pseudo-bulk estimates (similar to 2 degrees C) with respect to the bulk layer (similar to 1 degrees C). The diurnal warming of the sea surface, as derived by the pseudo-bulk temperature, occurs at about 14:30 local time, that is more than 2 h after the maximal sun elevation and an hour earlier than the bulk temperature maximum at 20-40 cm depth.

AB A capability to remotely measure the vertical and spatial distribution of forest structure is required for more accurate modeling of energy, carbon, water, and climate over regional, continental, and global scales. We examined the potential of using a multi-angle spectral sensor to predict forest vertical structure as measured by an airborne lidar system. Data were acquired from AirMISR (Airborne Multi-Angle Imaging Spectrometer) and airborne LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor) for a 7000 ha study site near Howland Maine, consisting of small plantations, multi-generation clearings and large natural forest stands. The LVIS data set provided a relatively direct measure of forest vertical structure at a fine scale (20 m diameter footprints). Multivariate linear regression and neural network models were developed to predict the LVIS forest energy height measures from 28 AirMISR multi-angle spectral radiance values. The best model accurately predicted the maximum canopy height (as measured from LVIS) using AirMISR data (rmse-0.92 m, R-2 =0.89). The models developed in this study achieved high accuracies over a study site with an elaborate patchwork of forest communities with exceptional diversity in forest structure. We conclude that models using MISR-like data are capable of accurately predicting the vertical structure of forest canopies. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Reflected solar radiances measured by the pushbroom cameras of the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiorneter (MISR) on the Terra satellite at nine viewing angles are combined to give eight stereo pairs. These are analyzed with stereo-photogrammetric methods to measure the geometry of a convective cloud system. Both cloud-top heights and cloud sides are retrieved with a precision of about 200-300 m. Two case studies of deep, convective clouds over ocean are considered. The accuracy of the MISR retrieval is tested in the first case study by reference to coincident, higher resolution stereo data from ASTER, showing how the accuracy of the cloud-top height retrieval is improved using the oblique MISR views. In the second case study, the entire cross-section of the cloud aligned with the viewing azimuthal direction is measured, using all nine cameras. The methodology presented is an important step towards more routine retrievals of the 3D geometrical reconstruction of isolated, deep-convective clouds. Such reconstructions are a necessary prerequisite to the subsequent 3D radiative transfer modeling used to aid the remote sensing of the elusive microphysical properties of such clouds.

AB Discolored seawater caused by volcanic activity can be detected with satellite remote sensing at some submarine volcanoes and volcanoes near coastlines. We demonstrate that two kinds of discolored seawaters can be discriminated by their reflectance patterns using ASTER Reflectance Product, at Satsuma-Iwojima, Japan. White to green seawater that is due to hydrous oxides formed when Al- and Fe-rich acidic waters mix with seawater shows high, medium and low reflectances at band 1 (central wavelength: 0.56 mu m), band 2 (central wavelength: 0.66 gm), and band 3 (central wavelength: 0.81 mu m), respectively. On the other hand, reddish-brown seawater that is due to the outflow of neutral-pH, iron-bicarbonate water shows high reflectance at band 2, medium reflectance at band 1 and low reflectance at band 3. The chemical composition of discolored seawater, which is one of the characteristics of volcanic activity, can be estimated from remote-sensing data. The ASTER Reflectance Product is a standard validated product generated by the ASTER Ground Data System using an atmospheric correction. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A ca. 1980 national-scale land-cover classification based on aerial photo interpretation was combined with 2000 AVHRR satellite imagery to derive land cover and land-cover change information for forest, urban, and agriculture categories over a seven-state region in the U.S. To derive useful land-cover change data using a heterogeneous dataset and to validate our results, we a) stratified the classification using predefined ecoregions, b) developed statistical relationships by ecoregion between land-cover proportions derived from the 1980 national-level classification and aggregate statistical data that were available in time series for all regions in the U.S., c) classified multi-temporal AVHRR data using a process that constrained the results to the estimated proportions of land covers in ecoregions within a multi-objective land allocation (MOLA) procedure, d) interpreted land cover from a sample of aerial photographs from 2000, following the protocols used to produce the 1980 classification for use in accuracy assessment of land cover and land-cover change data, and e) compared land cover and land-cover change results for the MOLA method with an unsupervised classification alone. Overall accuracies for the 2000 MOLA and unsupervised land-cover classifications were 85% and 82%, respectively. On average, the 1980-2000 land-cover change RMSEs were one order of magnitude lower using the MOLA method compared with those based on the unsupervised data. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Occurrence of mixed pixels in remote sensing images is a major problem particularly at coarse spatial resolutions. Therefore, sub-pixel classification is often preferred, where a pixel is resolved into various class components (also called class proportions or fractions). While, under most circumstances, land cover information in this form is more effective than crisp classification, sub-pixel classification fails to account for the spatial distribution of class proportions within the pixel. An alternative approach is to consider the spatial distribution of class proportions within and between pixels to perform super-resolution mapping (i.e. mapping land cover at a spatial resolution finer than the size of the pixel of the image). Markov random field (MRF) models are well suited to represent the spatial dependence within and between pixels. In this paper, an MRF model based approach is introduced to generate super-resolution land cover maps from remote sensing data. In the proposed MRF model based approach, the intensity values of pixels in a particular spatial structure (i.e., neighborhood) are allowed to have higher probability (i.e., weight) than others. Remote sensing images at two markedly different spatial resolutions, IKONOS MSS image at 4 in spatial resolution and Landsat ETM+ image at 30 in spatial resolution, are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MRF model based approach for super-resolution land cover mapping. The results show a significant increase in the accuracy of land cover maps at fine spatial resolution over that obtained from a recently proposed linear optimization approach suggested by Verhoeye and Wulf (2002) (Verhoeye, J., Wulf, R. D. (2002). Land Cover Mapping at Sub-pixel Scales using Linear Optimization Techniques, Remote Sensing of Environment, 79, 96-104). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID TARGET DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; PLUMES
AB This paper describes a new methodology to detect small anomalies in high resolution hyperspectral imagery, which involves successively: (1) a multivariate statistical analysis (principal component analysis, PCA) of all spectral bands; (2) a geostatistical filtering of noise and regional background in the first principal components using factorial kriging; and finally (3) the computation of a local indicator of spatial autocorrelation to detect local clusters of high or low reflectance values and anomalies. The approach is illustrated using I in resolution data collected in and near northeastern Yellowstone National Park. Ground validation data for tarps and for disturbed soils on mine tailings demonstrate the ability of the filtering procedure to reduce the proportion of false alarms (i.e., pixels wrongly classified as target), and its robustness under low signal to noise ratios. In almost all scenarios, the proposed approach outperforms traditional anomaly detectors (i.e., RX detector which computes the Mahalanobis distance between the vector of spectral values and the vector of global means), and fewer false alarms are obtained when using a novel statistic S-2 (average absolute deviation of p-values from 0.5 through all spectral bands) to summarize information across bands. Image degradation through addition of noise or reduction of spectral resolution tends to blur the detection of anomalies, increasing false alarms, in particular for the identification of the least pure pixels. Results from a mine tailings site demonstrate the approach performs reasonably well for highly complex landscape with multiple targets of various sizes and shapes. By leveraging both spectral and spatial information, the technique requires little or no input from the user, and hence can be readily automated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The utility of remote sensing in the study of fluvial systems depends upon the extent to which image data can be used to derive quantitative information of sufficient accuracy and precision for specific applications. In this study, we evaluate the effects of channel morphology on depth retrieval by coupling a radiative transfer model to various morphologic scenarios. Upwelling radiance L-u spectra generated for a range of depths (2-150 cm) and benthic cover types (limestone, periphyton, and gravel) were linearly mixed to simulate subpixel bed topography and substrate heterogeneity. For sloping bottoms, solar-streambed geometry modified L-u relative to a level bottom, especially for beds sloping steeply away from the sun. Aggregate pixel scale L-u spectra were compared to a database of simulated spectra to determine the radiance-equivalent depth of a uniform bottom (REDUB). REDUB spectra for hypothetical stepped streambeds indicated underestimation of the actual area-weighted mean depth, but the ln (L-u,L-560/L-u,L-690) REDUB ratio consistently reproduced the pixel-scale mean for beta distributions of depths. Similarly, when both dark periphyton and bright limestone substrates occurred within a pixel, REDUB spectra produced large errors while the ratio proved robust. Along channel banks, pixels will inevitably be mixed, and our simulations indicated that although bank fractions estimated by spectral mixture analysis were highly accurate for vegetated cutbanks, gravel bars were sensitive to the selection of both aquatic and terrestrial end members and subject to relatively large fraction errors. These theoretical results were tested using a ratio-based relative depth map and two-end member mixture models derived from a hyperspectral image of the Lamar River in Yellowstone National Park, which also served to illustrate the importance and applicability of our simulations. The primary conclusions of this study are that 1) the ratio-based algorithm is well-suited to complex river channels; 2) channel morphology and sensor spatial resolution must be considered jointly during data collection and analysis; and 3) the accuracy and precision of depth estimates are influenced by channel morphology and thus vary spatially.

AB In the urban environment both quality of life and surface biophysical processes are closely related to the presence of vegetation. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) has been frequently used to derive subpixel vegetation information from remotely sensed imagery in urban areas, where the underlying landscapes are assumed to be composed of a few fundamental components, called endmembers. A critical step in SMA is to identify the endmembers and their corresponding spectral signatures. A common practice in SMA assumes a constant spectral signature for each endmember. In fact, the spectral signatures of endmembers may vary from pixel to pixel due to changes in biophysical (e.g. leaves, stems and bark) and biochemical (e.g. chlorophyll content) composition. This study developed a Bayesian Spectral Mixture Analysis (BSMA) model to understand the impact of endmember variability on the derivation of subpixel vegetation fractions in an urban environment. BSMA incorporates endmember spectral variability in the unmixing process based on Bayes Theorem. In traditional SMA, each endmember is represented by a constant signature, while BSMA uses the endmember signature probability distribution in the analysis. BSMA has the advantage of maximally capturing the spectral variability of an image with the least number of endmembers. In this study, the BSMA model is first applied to simulated images, and then to Ikonos and Landsat ETM+ images. BSMA leads to an improved estimate of subpixel vegetation fractions, and provides uncertainty information for the estimates. The study also found that the traditional SMA using the statistical means of the signature distributions as endmember signatures produces subpixel endmember fractions with almost the same and sometimes even better accuracy than those from BSMA except without uncertainty information for the estimates. However, using the modes of signature distributions as endmembers may result in serious bias in subpixel endmember fractions derived from traditional SMA. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aerosol retrieval over land remains a difficult task because the solar light reflected by the Earth-atmospheric system mainly comes from the ground surface. The dark dense vegetation (DDV) algorithm for MODIS data has shown excellent competence at retrieving the aerosol distribution and properties. However, this algorithm is restricted to lower surface reflectance, such as water bodies and dense vegetation. In this paper, we attempt to derive aerosol optical thickness (AOT) by exploiting the synergy of TERRA and AQUA MODIS data (SYNTAM), which can be used for various ground surfaces, including for high-reflective surface. Preliminary validation results by comparing with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data show good accuracy and promising potential. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, sea surface emissivity (SSE) measurements obtained from thermal infrared radiance data are presented. These measurements were carried out from a fixed oilrig under open sea conditions in the Mediterranean Sea during the WInd and Salinity Experiment 2000 (WISE 2000). The SSE retrieval methodology uses quasi-simultaneous measurements of the radiance coming from the sea surface and the downwelling sky radiance, in addition to the sea surface temperature (SST). The radiometric data were acquired by a CIMEL ELECTRONIQUE CE 312 radiometer, with four channels placed in the 8-14 mum region. The sea temperature was measured with high-precision thermal probes located on oceanographic buoys, which is not exactly equal to the required SST. A study of the skin effect during the radiometric measurements used in this work showed that a constant bulk-skin temperature difference of 0.05+/-0.06 K was present for wind speeds larger than 5 m/s. Our study is limited to these conditions. Thus, SST used as a reference for SSE retrieval was obtained as the temperature measured by the contact thermometers placed on the buoys at 20-cm depth minus this bulk-skin temperature difference.
   SSE was obtained under several observation angles and surface wind speed conditions, allowing us to study both the angular and the sea surface roughness dependence. Our results were compared with SSE models, showing the validity of the model of Masuda et al. [Masuda, K., Takashima, T., & Takayama, Y. (1988) Emissivity of pure seawaters for the model sea surface in the infrared window regions. Remote Sensing of Environment, 24, 313-329.] for observation angles up to 50degrees. For larger angles, the effect of double or multiple reflections on the sea surface produces discrepancies between measured and theoretical SSEs, and more complex models should be used to get accurate SSE values, such as the model of Wu and Smith [Wu, X., & Smith, W.L. (1997). Emissivity of rough sea surface for 8-13 mum: modelling and verification. Applied Optics, 36, 2609-2619.]. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB With rapid urban growth in recent years, understanding urban biophysical composition and dynamics becomes an important research topic. Remote sensing technologies introduce a potentially scientific basis for examining urban composition and monitoring its changes over time. The vegetation-impervious surface-soil (V-I-S) model, in particular, provides a foundation for describing urban/suburban environments and a basis for further urban analyses including urban growth modeling, environmental impact analysis, and socioeconomic factor estimation. This paper develops a normalized spectral mixture analysis (NSMA) method to examine urban composition in Columbus Ohio using Landsat ETM+ data. In particular, a brightness normalization method is applied to reduce brightness variation. Through this normalization, brightness variability within each V-I-S component is reduced or eliminated, thus allowing a single endmember representing each component. Further, with the normalized image, three endmembers, vegetation, impervious surface, and soil, are chosen to model heterogeneous urban composition using a constrained spectral mixture analysis (SMA) model. The accuracy of impervious surface estimation is assessed and compared with two other existing models. Results indicate that the proposed model is a better alternative to existing models, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.1% for impervious surface estimation in the study area.

AB Knowledge of the distribution of crop types is important for land management and trade decisions, and is needed to constrain remotely sensed estimates of variables, such as crop stress and productivity. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) offers a unique combination of spectral, temporal, and spatial resolution compared to previous global sensors, making it a good candidate for large-scale crop type mapping. However, because of subpixel heterogeneity, the application of traditional hard classification approaches to MODIS data may result in significant errors in crop area estimation. We developed and tested a linear unmixing approach with MODIS that estimates subpixel fractions of crop area based on the temporal signature of reflectance throughout the growing season. In this method, termed probabilistic temporal unmixing (PTU), endmember sets were constructed using Landsat data to identify pure pixels, and uncertainty resulting from endmember variability was quantified using Monte Carlo simulation. This approach was evaluated using Landsat classification maps in two intensive agricultural regions, the Yaqui Valley (YV) of Mexico and the Southern Great Plains (SGP). Performance of the mixture model varied depending on the scale of comparison, with R-2 ranging from roughly 50% for estimating crop area within individual pixels to greater than 80% for crop cover within areas over 10 km(2). The results of this study demonstrate the importance of subpixel heterogeneity in cropland systems, and the potential of temporal unmixing to provide accurate and rapid assessments of land cover distributions using coarse resolution sensors, such as MODIS.

AB The miombo woodlands of southern Africa are one of the most extensively burned biomes in the tropics. The detectability of understory burns in these woodlands was assessed with a sensitivity analysis approach, based on a hybrid geometrical-optical radiative transfer model. Model input data were obtained from a variety of sources, including field biometry and spectroradiometry, and satellite data. The effects of variable tree percent cover, leaf area index, stand density, burn scar age, illumination and observation geometry, and spectral region, were taken into account. Detectability of understory burns was defined as the spectral separability of burned and unburned understory, measured with the Jeffries-Matusita distance, for all possible combinations of the green, red, and near-infrared channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) sensor. Single channels, or pairwise combinations of channels perform poorly at detecting understory burns, but a large improvement in detectability is obtained for the combination of the three spectral domains. The detectability of understory burns is largely insensitive to the effects of stand structure and illumination/observation geometry, and depends primarily on burn scar age. Our results agree with those of previous satellite-based studies of burns scar detectability in African savanna woodlands. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The main objectives of this research were to: (a) determine the best hyperspectral wavebands in the study of vegetation and agricultural crops over the spectral range of 400-2500 nm; and (b) assess the vegetation and agricultural crop classification accuracies achievable using the various combinations of the best hyperspectral narrow wavebands. The hyperspectral data were gathered for shrubs, grasses, weeds, and agricultural crop species from the four ecoregions of African savannas using a I -nm-wide hand-held spectroradiometer but was aggregated to I 0-nm-wide bandwidths to match the first spaceborne hyperspectral sensor, Hyperion. After accounting for atmospheric widows and/or areas of significant noise, a total of 168 narrowbands in 400-2500 nm was used in the analysis.
   Rigorous data mining techniques consisting of principal component analysis (PCA), lambda-lambda R-2 models (LL (RM)-M-2), stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA), and derivative greenness vegetation indices (DGVI) established 22 optimal bands (in 400-2500 nm spectral range) that best characterize and classify vegetation and agricultural crops. Overall accuracies of over 90% were attained when the 13-22 best narrowbands were used in classifying vegetation and agricultural crop species. Beyond 22 bands, accuracies only increase marginally up to 30 bands. Accuracies become asymptotic or near zero beyond 30 bands, rendering 138 of the 168 narrowbands redundant in extracting vegetation and agricultural crop information. Relative to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) broadbands, the best hyperspectral narrowbands provided an increased accuracy of 9-43% when classifying shrubs, weeds, grasses, and agricultural crop species.

AB The MultiResolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium sponsored production of the National Land Cover Data (NLCD) for the conterminous United States, using Landsat imagery collected on a target year of 1992 (1992 NLCD). Here we report the thematic accuracy of the 1992 NLCD for the six western mapping regions. Reference data were collected in each region for a probability sample of pixels stratified by map land-cover class. Results are reported for each of the six mapping regions with agreement defined as a match between the primary or alternate reference land-cover label and a mode class of the mapped 3 X 3 block of pixels centered on the sample pixel. Overall accuracy at Anderson Level 11 was low and variable across the regions, ranging from 38% for the Midwest to 70% for the Southwest. Overall accuracy at Anderson Level I was higher and more consistent across the regions, ranging from 82% to 85% for five of the six regions, but only 74% for the South-central region.

AB The Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere (LBA) experiment in Amazonia represents a unique opportunity to make a comprehensive study of the Amazon region and its component ecosystems. To make sense of the field studies and to generalize the results from them, remote sensing techniques and comprehensive mapping are critical elements for producing region-wide science results. In this paper, we present the processing work done for one such mapping campaign, that of the JERS-1 L-band two season (low and high-flood) SAR data collected in 1995 and 1996. Specifically, to make a useable resource for other LBA researchers to explore, the datasets from the two seasons had to be coregistered (to a sub-pixel level), radiometrically calibrated, and interpreted to verify the quality of the data. This paper describes the techniques used to achieve these goals and an estimate of the land cover based on a simple classification of the data. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A synthetic data spectral Cube that represents at-sensor radiance data of AVIRIS was used to examine the accuracy of several methods to recover absolute Surface reflectance data of terrestrial targets. Soil and vegetation targets, selected to represent the images of ground variation and their spectra, were retrieved using HATCH, Empirical Line (EL) and their hybrids methods. After a synthetic radiance data cube was generated, reflectance recovery was carried out and compared with the true (input) reflectance information. It was found that even under controlled and ideal conditions, the spectral recovery using HATCH code provided differences of up to 40%. The EL methods, using the two end-members that represent the scene reduced this difference to about 4%, and in some cases, even to 0.1% It was found that selecting the calibration targets over low water vapor content improved the results. Applying EL oil radiance data provided a severe difference of more than 200% in areas located outside the calibration target water vapor zone. Only over similar water vapor zones were the EL methods found to reasonably recover the surface reflectance. Examining the spectral variability in the calibration targets showed that using, of spectral features targets with relative spectral similarity is almost as effective as using spectrally featureless targets for the EL process. Applying EL, using external spectral information of possible known targets, revealed a relatively high difference, as compared to the true reflectance data. However, thematic analysis using a SAM classifier proved that even under non-ideal conditions, the EL correction can yield a reasonable spatial mapping capability relative to those obtained under real reflectance domains. It was concluded that EL must be run oil reflectance data (generated from absolute based method) over low water vapor zones to provide the most precise reflectance information. Also, it Was found that it is not mandatory to select calibration targets that are totally featureless or characterized by low or high albedo response. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We aimed to evaluate how the remote sensing vegetation indices NDVI and PRI responded to seasonal and annual changes in an early successional stage Mediterranean coastal shrubland canopy that was submitted to experimental warming and drought simulating predicted climate change for the next decades. These conditions were obtained by using a new non-intrusive methodological approach that increases the temperature and prolongs the drought period by using roofs that automatically cover the vegetation after the sunset or when it rains. On average, warming increased air temperature by 0.7 degreesC and soil temperature by 1.6 degreesC, and the drought treatment reduced soil moisture by 22%. We measured spectral reflectance at the canopy level and at the individual plant level seasonally during 4 years. Shrubland NDVI tracked the community development and activity. In control and warming treatments, NDVI increased with the years while it did not change in the drought treatment. There was a good relationship between NDVI and both community and individual plant biomass. NDVI also decreased in summer seasons when some species dry or decolour. The NDVI of E. multiflora plant individuals was lower in autumn and winter than in the other seasons, likely because of flowering. Shrubland PRI decreased only in winter, similarly to the PRI of the most dominant species, G. alypum. At this community scale, NDVI was better related than PRI to photosynthetic activity, probably because photosynthetic fluxes followed canopy seasonal greening in this complex canopy, which includes brevideciduous, annual and evergreen species and variable morphologies and canopy coverage. PRI followed the seasonal variations in photosynthetic rates in E. multiflora and detected the decreased photosynthetic rates of drought treatment. However, PRI did not track the photosynthetic rates of G. alypum plants which have lower LAIs than E. multiflora. In this community, which is in its early successional stages, NDVI was able to track biomass, and indirectly, CO2 uptake changes, likely because LAI values did not saturate NDVI. Thus, NDVI appears as a valid tool for remote tracking of this community development. PRI was less adequate for photosynthetic assessment of this community especially for its lower LAI canopies. PRI usefulness was also species-dependent and could also be affected by flowering. These results will help to improve the interpretation of remote sensing information on the structure and physiological status of these Mediterranean shrublands, and to gain better insight on ecological and environmental controls on their ecosystem carbon dioxide exchange. They also show the possibility of assessing the impacts of climate change on shrubland communities. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Snow-cover information is important for a wide variety of scientific studies, water supply and management applications. The NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides improved capabilities to observe snow cover from space and has been successfully using a normalized difference snow index (NDSI), along with threshold tests, to provide global, automated binary maps of snow cover. The NDSI is a spectral band ratio that takes advantage of the spectral differences of snow in short-wave infrared and visible MODIS spectral bands to identify snow versus other features in a scene. This study has evaluated whether there is a "signal" in the NDSI that could be used to estimate the fraction of snow within a 500 in MODIS pixel and thereby enhance the use of the NDSI approach in monitoring snow cover. Using Landsat 30-m observations as "ground truth," the percentage of snow cover was calculated for 500-m cells. Then a regression relationship between 500-m NDSI observations and fractional snow cover was developed over three different snow-covered regions and tested over other areas. The overall results indicate that the relationship between fractional snow cover and NDSI is reasonably robust when applied locally and over large areas like North America. The relationship offers advantages relative to other published fractional snow cover algorithms developed for global-scale use with MODIS. This study indicates that the fraction of snow cover within a MODIS pixel using this approach can be provided with a mean absolute error less than 0.1 over the range from 0.0 to 1.0 in fractional snow cover.

AB This paper reports on the use of linear spectral mixture analysis for the retrieval of canopy leaf area index (LAI) in three flux tower sites in the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS) southern study area: Old Black Spruce, Old Jack Pine, and Young Jack Pine (SOBS, SOJP, and SYJP). The data used were obtained by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) with a spatial resolution of 2 m in the winter of 1994. The convex geometry method was used to select the endmembers: sunlit crown, sunlit snow, and shadow. Along transects for these flux tower sites, the fraction of sunlit snow was found to have a higher correlation with the field-measured canopy LAI than the fraction of sunlit crown or the fraction of shadow. An empirical equation was obtained to describe the relation between canopy LAI and the fraction of sunlit snow. There is a strong correlation between the estimated LAI and the field-measured LAI along transects (with R-2 values of 0.54, 0.71, and 0.60 obtained for the SOBS, SYJP, and SOJP sites, respectively). The estimated LAI for the whole tower site is consistent with that obtained by the inversion of a canopy model in our previous study where values of 0.94, 0.92, and 0.63 were obtained for R-2 for the SOBS, SYJP and SOJP sites, respectively.
   The CAST 2-m summer data over the SOBS site was also employed to investigate the possibility of deriving canopy LAI from the summer data using linear mixture analysis. At a spatial resolution of 10 m, the correlation between the field-measured LAI and the estimated LAI along transects is small at R-2 less than 0.3, while R-2 increases to 0.6 at a spatial resolution of 30 m. The difficulty in canopy LAI retrieval from the summer data at a spatial resolution of 10 m is likely due to the variation of the understory reflectance across the scene, although spatial misregistration of the CAST data used may also be a possible contributing factor.

AB Spectroradiometric measurements were made over a range of crop canopy densities, soil backgrounds and foliage colour. The reflected spectral radiances were convoluted with the spectral response functions of a range of satellite instruments to simulate their responses. When Normalised Difference Vegetation Indices (NDVI) from the different instruments were compared, they varied by a few percent, but the values were strongly linearly related, allowing vegetation indices from one instrument to be intercalibrated against another. A table of conversion coefficents is presented for AVHRR, ATSR-2, Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+, SPOT-2 and SPOT-4 HRV, IRS, IKONOS, SEAWIFS, MISR, MODIS, POLDER, Quickbird and MERI S (see Appendix A for glossary of acronyms). The same set of coefficients was found to apply, within the margin of error of the analysis, for the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index SAVI. The relationships for SPOT vs. TM and for ATSR-2 vs. AVHRR were directly validated by comparison of atmospherically corrected image data. The results indicate that vegetation indices can be interconverted to a precision of 1-2%. This result offers improved opportunities for monitoring crops through the growing season and the prospects of better continuity of long-term monitoring of vegetation responses to environmental change.

AB Spatial variation of land-surface properties is a major challenge to ecological and biogeochemical studies in the Amazon basin. The scale dependence of biophysical variation (e.g., mixtures of vegetation cover types), as depicted in Landsat observations, was assessed for the common land-cover types bordering the Tapajos National Forest, Central Brazilian Amazon. We first collected hyperspectral signatures of vegetation and soils contributing to the optical reflectance of landscapes in a 600-km(2) region. We then employed a spectral mixture model AutoMCU that utilizes bundles of the field spectra with Monte Carlo analysis to estimate sub-pixel cover of green plants, senescent vegetation and soils in Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) pixels. The method proved useful for quantifying biophysical variability within and between individual land parcels (e.g., across different pasture conditions). Image textural analysis was then performed to assess surface variability at the inter-pixel scale. We compared the results from the textural analysis (inter-pixel scale) to spectral mixture analysis (sub-pixel scale). We tested the hypothesis that very high resolution, sub-pixel estimates of surface constituents are needed to detect important differences in the biophysical structure of deforested lands. Across a range of deforestation categories common to the region, there was strong correlation between the fractional green and senescent vegetation cover values derived from spectral unmixing and texture analysis variance results (r(2) > 0.85, p < 0.05). These results support the argument that, in deforested areas, biophysical heterogeneity at the scale of individual field plots (sub-pixel) is similar to that of whole clearings when viewed from the Landsat vantage point.

AB The estimation of plant water content is essential to the integration of remote sensing into precision agriculture. Hyperspectral models developed to estimate plant water content have had limited application under field conditions and have not been rigorously validated. A physical model using a spectrum matching technique was applied to hyperspectral data to directly calculate the canopy equivalent water thickness (EWT) using a look-up table approach. The objective of this study was to test the validity of this algorithm using plant water content information collected under field conditions and to relate this to the needs of precision agriculture. Image data were acquired over two experimental test sites in Canada, near Clinton, Ontario and Indian Head, Saskatchewan, using the Probe-1 airborne hyperspectral sensor. Plant biomass samples were collected simultaneously from plots spanning fourteen fields of various crop types (wheat, canola, corn, beans, and peas). The model was validated against EWT estimated from biomass samples, as well as more conventional measures of crop water status. The model accurately predicts water content in the range found with all crop types pooled together, with an index of agreement (D) of 0.92 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 26.8% of the average. On an individual crop basis, the model proved to be a poor predictor for wheat crops (RMSE = 69.9%). When wheat fields were removed from the overall analysis, the RMSE was 17.9% and the D was 0.87. While the model provided a reasonably accurate prediction of EWT for broadleaf crops like beans, corn, canola, and peas (D = 0.88, 0.69, 0.88, and 0.84, respectively), the error margin in the prediction was too large for to precisely detect within-crop variation for the low variability found in corn and bean crops in this study. EWT is related to plant biomass and leaf area index (LAI), both quantities of interest to precision agriculture. Crown Copyright (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The intertidal environments of estuaries represent critical exchange environments of sediment and sediment bound contaminants. Ecological and sedimentological related investigations of these environments require monitoring methods that provide rapid spatially representative data on sediment grain size distribution. Remote sensing has the potential to provide synoptic information of intertidal environments. Previous in situ and laboratory-based reflectance investigations have demonstrated that for effective quantification of sediment grain size distributions, remote sensing platforms must include measurements within the short-wave infrared (SWIR). In addition, the timing of image acquisition, in relation to tidal cycles and sediment moisture content, is critical in optimising the spectral differences between the coarser sand and finer 'mud' fraction of sediments. Daedalus 1268 Airborne Thematic Mapper (ATM) has been identified as an appropriate platform and sensor for providing accurate synoptic maps of estuarine sediment distributions. This paper presents the results from the application of ATM 1.75 m resolution data to the mapping of surface sediment grain-size distributions across intertidal areas of Ribble Estuary, Lancashire, UK. ATM imagery was acquired after the intertidal area was exposed to strong summer drying conditions. Pre-processing and linear unmixing of the imagery collected of the intertidal zone following a period of drying allowed accurate sub-pixel determinations (1.75 in resolution) of sediment clay (r(2)=0.79) but less accurate for sand (r(2)=0.60). The results also demonstrate deterioration in the image calibration with increasing sediment moisture content and microphytobenthos cover. However, recombining the subpixel end member abundances through multivariate regression analysis improved the image calibration significantly for both sediment clay and sand content (r(2) >0.8) for imagery collected in both dryer and wetter conditions. These results demonstrate that ATM data, or similar, can be used to gain quantitative information on intertidal sediment distributions and such data has application to a wide variety of estuarine research.

ID INSTRUMENT; IMAGERY
AB We propose an automatic neural classification method for ocean colour (OC) reflectance measurements taken at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) by satellite-borne sensors. The goal is to identify aerosol types and cloud contaminated pixels. This information is of importance when selecting appropriate atmospheric correction algorithms for retrieving ocean parameters such as phytoplankton concentrations. The methodology is based on the use of Topological Neural network Algorithms (TNA, so-called Kohonen maps). The pixels of the remotely sensed image are characterised by a vector whose components are the spectral TOA measurement and the standard deviation of a small spatial structure. The method is a three-step method. The first step is an unsupervised classification built from a learning data set; it clusters pixel vectors which are similar into a certain number of groups. Each group is characterised by a specific vector, the so-called reference vector (rv), which summarises the information contained in all the pixels belonging to that group. The second step of the method consists of labeling the reference vectors with the help of an expert in ocean optics. The groups are then clustered into classes corresponding to physical characteristics provided by the expert. The third step consists of analyzing full images and classifying them by using the classifier which has been determined during the first two steps. The method was applied to the Cape Verde region, which exhibits important seasonal variability in terms of aerosols, cloud coverage and ocean chlorophyll-a concentration. We processed POLDER data to test the algorithm. We considered four classes: pixels contaminated by clouds; two types of pixels containing mineral dusts; and pixels containing maritime aerosols only. The method was able to take into account the information given by the expert and apply it to unlabeled pixels. This methodology could easily be extended to a larger number of classes, the major problem being to find adequate expertise to label the classes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A key problem in aerosol retrieval is to distinguish between surface and atmospheric contributions to the variability in the satellite signal. A major contribution in the surface-related variability is caused by the non-Lambertian nature of the Earth surface reflectance and the fact that the illumination/observation geometry varies considerably between successive observations of the same area (with a polar orbiting sensor). In principle, if the surface boundary condition can be specified with sufficient accuracy by means of a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), the two contributions can be unfolded and aerosol information retrieved. This approach has been tested using combined datasets made of satellite measured "top of atmosphere" (TOA) radiance and corresponding ground estimation of the aerosol optical thickness. Studying a time series of data, taking into account geometrical conditions and assuming the ground BRDF to be constant during the time period, a coupled surface/atmosphere model was used to investigate the retrieval of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over several sites. By fitting a subset of satellite observations associated with ground photometer data, a best fit of BRDF model parameters could be determined. This surface characterization is then used to reduce the model unknowns to AOT only and thereby to permit its retrieval from the satellite data alone, by means of a simple inversion process. The study was conducted on three European AERONET sites and using satellite data from both the VEGETATION and Sea viewing Wide Field of view (SeaWiFS) sensors. In all cases, the AOT retrieved from satellite was in good agreement with the measurements. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The C4 composition of Canadian mixed-grass communities is more sensitive to environmental change than other grasslands. Reliable methods of detecting such changes are necessary if these landscapes are to be properly managed. One approach is to use satellite remote sensing systems. Various studies have shown that the asynchronous seasonality of C3 and C4 species allows the relative abundance of each photosynthetic type to be estimated using temporal trajectory indices (TTIs) of sensor-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In this study, we compared three approaches for predicting C4 species cover at Grasslands National Park (GNP) (Saskatchewan, Canada). TTIs related to Approach I were calculated from plots of NDVI vs. day-of-year (DOY). TTIs related to Approach II were calculated from plots of normalized cumulative NDVI vs. growing degree day (GDD). TTIs related to Approach III were calculated as ratios of early-season NDVI to late-season NDVI. Our analyses were conducted at two separate ecological scales. A within-community analysis used field-sampled data from upland grassland to compare techniques at sampling resolutions of 0.5, 2.5, 10, and 50 m. An across-community analysis compared techniques using a vegetation survey of the GNP region and TTIs calculated from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data (1 km). At both scales, TTIs related to the timing of specific phenological events were the best predictors of C4 species cover. While all techniques performed well in the within-community study, Approach III performed best. Here, the predictive ability of each approach was weak at a resolution of 0.5 in but stronger at 2.5, 10, and 50 m resolutions. We also found that the optimal sampling dates for Approach III fell within a certain GDD range. This is encouraging for the a priori selection of sample dates, which would make the need for full seasonal time series redundant. In the across-community analysis, the AVHRR-derived Approach II TTIs were better able to discriminate among grasslands of different C4 composition than any other technique (overall accuracy = 74%). However, for some C4 cover classes, the predictive accuracy of this approach was low. While these results are encouraging for the use of spectral data in monitoring the C4 cover of northern prairie, various research issues remain. At the within-community level, these include (a) further attempts to define objective criteria for the a priori identification of sampling dates for Approach III, and (b) and the extension of such studies to other growing seasons and community types/grassland regions. At the across-community level, these include the expansion of such techniques to a larger geographical region that contains a wider range in C4 cover values and land use types (e.g. ungrazed vs. grazed grasslands).

AB Wetlands are one of the most important ecosystems in the world and at the same time they are presumed to be a source of methane gas, which is one of the most important greenhouse gases. The West Siberian wetlands is the largest in the world and remote sensing techniques can play an important role for monitoring the wetland.
   High spatial resolution satellite data are effective for monitoring land cover type changes, but can't cover a wide area because of a narrow swath width. On the other hand, global scale data are indispensable in covering a large area, but are too coarse to get the detailed information due to the low spatial resolution. It is necessary to devise a method for the fusion of the data with different spatial resolutions for monitoring the scale-differed phenomena.
   In this paper, firstly, a SPOT HRV image near Plotnikovo mire was used to map four wetland ecosystems (birch forest, conifer forest, forested bog and open bog) supplemented by field observation. Then, spectral mixture analysis was performed between NOAA AVHRR and SPOT HRV data acquired on the same day.
   Secondly, field observations were scaled up with these different spatial resolution satellite data. Each of the wetland ecosystem coverage fraction at the sub-pixel level was provided by spectral mixture analysis. Field observation shows that the mean rate of CH4 emission from forested bog and open bog averaged 21.1 and 233.1 (mg CH4/m(2)/day), respectively. The methane emission from the area was estimated by multiplying these average methane emission rates and the fraction coverage in each AVHRR pixel.
   Finally, the total methane emission over AVHRR coverage was estimated to be 9.46 (10(9) g CH4/day) and the mean methane emission over AVHRR coverage was calculated as 59.3 (mg CH4/m(2)/day). We could conclude that this mean value is within the probabilistic variability as compared with the airborne measurement results. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The following paper presents a method to retrieve surface reflectance, emissivity and temperature in the middle infrared (3-5 mum) and thermal infrared (8-12 mum). It is applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data acquired over Southern Africa during the August to October 2000 period. This method relies first on atmospheric correction of the middle-thermal infrared radiances which uses National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) humidity, pressure and temperature profiles and second on constructing and using a database of night emissivities ratio (Temperature Independent Spectral Indices of Emissivity, TISIE). The middle infrared reflectances (3-5 pm) are then derived from day-time measurements and mean TISIE values. By hemispheric integration (over a 16-day period), they lead to middle infrared directional emissivity which, combined with TISIE again, leads to thermal infrared emissivity and surface temperature. The reflectance accuracies are assessed by looking at targets of known reflectance (water and sun-glint). The emissivities in the thermal infrared are assessed by checking the spectral invariance of the derived surface temperature in the 3-5- and 8-12-mum region. Other consistency checks are performed leading to the conclusion that the reflectance, emissivity and surface temperature are derived within 0.015, 0.01 and 1 K, respectively. Finally, a direct application of the MODIS middle infrared surface reflectances to the fire detection problem is developed and the results compared to the Landsat 7 high spatial resolution data.

AB This study evaluates the performance of IRS-1c Linear Imaging Self-Scanning Sensor 3 (LISS-3) data for assessment of slight and moderate defoliation, induced by the different stress factors affecting the boreal forests of Vastemorrland, Sweden, in stands dominated by Norway spruce and Scots pine. It shows that accuracies as good as with Landsat TM can be produced with IRS-1c LISS-3 data, and that defoliation in pine could be assessed with only a slightly lower accuracy than in spruce. As in previous studies of spruce defoliation, the near-infrared (NIR) band was best correlated with spruce defoliation. Among the single bands, the NIR band was also best correlated with pine defoliation, although the relationship was even stronger with the ratios between NIR and red, and NDVI. Compared to spruce, assessment of pine defoliation appeared to be more sensitive to the presence of species other than pine. The strength of the relationship between LISS-3 data and defoliation increased significantly (from r=-.73 to r=-.91 for NIR/red, note however the reduced sample size), when only plots with more than 80% pine, rather than 70%, were included in the analysis. An attempt to normalize satellite data for species composition did not raise correlation coefficients for spruce data, and only slightly for pine data. Topographic normalization on the other hand, strongly increased the correlation coefficients between NIR radiance and spruce defoliation. A large part of the pine plots were located on near-horizontal ground; thus, topographical normalization only slightly increased correlation coefficients. This study verifies that high-resolution satellite data provide a means to assess the overall needle loss situation on a forest stand level provided that: the stands are fairly homogenous, not too open, dominated by spruce (> 60%) or pine (>70%), located in level or moderately undulating terrain (<15° slope), and express a needle loss range of at least 20%. The utility of IRS LISS data in addition to earlier evaluated Landsat TM data strongly improves the possibility to perform operational satellite-based monitoring in areas with frequent cloud cover.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated the usefulness of optical indices from hyperspectral remote sensing in the assessment of vegetation biophysical variables both in forestry and agriculture. Those indices are, however, the combined response to variations of several vegetation and environmental properties, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content, canopy shadows, and background soil reflectance. Of particular significance to precision agriculture is chlorophyll content, an indicator of photosynthesis activity, which is related to the nitrogen concentration in green vegetation and serves as a measure of the crop response to nitrogen application. This paper presents a combined modeling and indices-based approach to predicting the crop chlorophyll content from remote sensing data while minimizing LAI (vegetation parameter) influence and underlying soil (background) effects. This combined method has been developed first using simulated data and followed by evaluation in terms of quantitative predictive capability using real hyperspectral airborne data. Simulations consisted of leaf and canopy reflectance modeling with PROSPECT and SAILH radiative transfer models. In this modeling study, we developed an index that integrates advantages of indices minimizing soil background effects and indices that are sensitive to chlorophyll concentration. Simulated data have shown that the proposed index Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (TCARI/OSAVI) is both very sensitive to chlorophyll content variations and very resistant to the variations of LAI and solar zenith angle. It was therefore possible to generate a predictive equation to estimate leaf chlorophyll content from the combined optical index derived from above-canopy reflectance. This relationship was evaluated by application to hyperspectral CASI imagery collected over corn crops in three experimental farms from Ontario and Quebec, Canada. The results presented here are from the L'Acadie, Quebec, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada research site. Images of predicted leaf chlorophyll content were generated. Evaluation showed chlorophyll variability over crop plots with various levels of nitrogen, and revealed an excellent agreement with ground truth, with a correlation of r(2)=.81 between estimated and field measured chlorophyll content data.

AB The determination of shallow water depth in high-energy tidal inlets is essential to model and to forecast the navigation channel position or the short-term topographic evolution of beaches. Colour satellite imagery provides, at low cost, complete maps of areas that are difficult to map by traditional hydrographic means due to their size and their rough underwater morphology. In order to calibrate SPOT images to derive bathymetric maps, a simple method applied to shallow waters of a moderately turbid tidal inlet has been carried out. Its development is based on a set of field measurements, including the reflectance of the water and of the bottom sediment, the vertically averaged diffuse attenuation coefficient, and the concentrations of inorganic particles in suspension, of chlorophyll a and pheopigments and of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). From these data, it appears, first, that the water reflectance is directly linked to the depth, and second, that the water reflectance varies slowly with the turbidity in this area for total suspended matter (SM) concentrations lower than 9 mg l(-1). The extinction of light with depth has been characterized in the inlet. The relationship obtained is slightly different from that observed in clear waters. The bathymetric models established for the clearest waters do not calculate the depth accurately. In the contrary, reflectance code adapted to Case II water type, calibrated with in situ measurements, allows us to retrieve depth down to 6 m and for total SM concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 9 mg l(-1). This relationship has been applied to five SPOT images of the mouth of Arcachon lagoon. The accuracy of the derived map has been assessed by in situ depth measurements. The mean difference between measured depths and computed depths is about 20%. This accuracy is adequate to assess the inlet morphodynamics quantitatively, which is necessary for middle-term to short-term mathematical modeling of the 3D inlet evolution.

ID RAIN-FOREST; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; CARBON; FIRE
AB We combined a detailed Field study of forest canopy damage with calibrated Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) reflectance data and texture analysis to assess the sensitivity of basic broadband optical remote sensing to selective logging in Amazonia. Our Field study encompassed measurements of ground damage and canopy gap fractions along a chronosequence of postharvest regrowth of 0.5 - 3.5 years. We found that canopy damage and regrowth rates varied according to the logging method used, either conventional logging or reduced impact logging. Areas used to stage felled trees prior to transport, log decks, had the largest gap fractions immediately following cutting. Log decks were quickly colonized by early successional plant species, resulting in significant gap fraction decreases within 1.5 years after site abandonment. Although log decks were the most obvious damage areas on the ground and in satellite imagery, they accounted for only 1-2% of the total harvested area of the blocks studied. Other forest damage features such as tree-fall gaps, skid trails, and roads were difficult to recognize in Landsat reflectance data or through textural analysis. These landscape features could be only crudely resolved in the most intensively logged forests and within about 0.5 years following harvest. We found that forest damage within any of the landscape strata (decks, roads, skids, tree falls) could not be resolved with Landsat reflectance or texture data when the canopy gap fraction was < 50%. The basic Landsat ETM+ imagery lacks the resolution of forest structural features required for quantitative studies of logging damage. Landsat textural analyses may be useful for broad delineation of logged forests, but detailed ecological and biogeochemical studies will probably need to rely on other remote sensing approaches. Until spatial gradients of canopy damage and regrowth resulting from selective logging operations in tropical forests in the Amazon region are resolved, the impacts of this land use on a continental scale will remain poorly understood.

TI The effect of dew on the use of RADARSAT-1 for crop monitoring -
   Choosing between ascending and descending orbits
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Radar sensors, like RADARSAT-1. can be a valuable tool for monitoring agricultural crops. RADARSAT-1 imagery can be acquired regardless of cloud cover, and the satellite can be programmed to collect imagery, in a wide range of beam modes and incidence angles. This flexibility significantly increases the revisit schedule, thereby ensuring that images can be acquired during key crop growth stages. Users also have the flexibility of choosing acquisitions during either ascending or descending orbits. However, the condition of agricultural targets can change diurnally, and consequently, care must be taken in choosing between RADARSAT-1's dawn and dusk orbits, In temperate regions. early morning dew, is often present on the crop canopy at the time of the satellite overpass. Consequently, this study used fine mode dawn, dusk image pairs acquired over western Canada to examine the potential effect of dew on operational crop mapping. The data consistently demonstrated that backscatter increased when dew was present on the canopy. However. overall crop separability did not appear to be affected by the presence of dew. These results indicate that although choice of orbit is less important for crop classification, the probability of dew on the canopy must be carefully considered when users are extracting quantitative crop information from radar imagery.

AB Landscape pattern represents a key variable in management and understanding of the environment, as well as driving many environmental models. Remote sensing can be used to provide information on the spatial pattern of land cover features, but analysis and classification of such imagery suffers from the problem of class mixing within pixels. Soft classification techniques can estimate the class composition of image pixels. However, their output provides no indication of how such classes are distributed spatially within the instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV) represented by the pixel. Techniques to provide an improved spatial representation of land cover targets larger than the size of a pixel have been developed. However, the mapping of subpixel scale land cover features has yet to be investigated. We recently described the application of a Hopfield neural network technique to super-resolution mapping of land cover features larger than a pixel, using information of pixel composition determined from soft classification, and now show how our approach can be extended in a new way to predict the spatial pattern of subpixel scale features. The network converges to a minimum of an energy function defined as a goal and several constraints. Prior information on the typical spatial arrangement of the particular land cover ty.. gy. pes is incorporated into the energy function as a semivariance constraint. This produces a prediction of the spatial pattern of the land cover in question, at the subpixel scale. The technique is applied to synthetic and simulated Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, and compared to results of an existing super-resolution target identification technique. Results show that the new approach represents a simple, robust, and efficient tool for super-resolution land cover pattern prediction from remotely sensed imagery. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Mixed pixels result when the sensor's instantaneous field-of-view includes more than one land cover class on the ground. For mixed pixels, fuzzy classifiers can be used, which assign a pixel to several land cover classes in proportion to the area of the pixel that each class covers. These fraction values can be assigned to sub-pixels, based on the assumption of spatial dependence and the application of linear optimization techniques, A newly proposed sub-pixel mapping algorithm was first applied to a synthetic data set with a 1-km resolution, derived from a 20-m resolution image. This algorithm yielded land cover maps at 500, 200, and 100 m resolution with accuracies close to 89%. Subsequent mode filtering further increased these values. When applied to a real data set. the accuracy reached 78%. While this study suggests the potential of the proposed technique. there is still ample scope for improvements and extensions.

AB The aim of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of using Landsat ETM+ data for the determination of leaf area index (LAI). The investigation is prompted by the need for obtaining spatially distributed data on LAI to be used as input for carbon modelling of northern boreal forests. Detailed field data have been collected in a coniferous forest area in Uppland, central Sweden, dominated by Norway spruce and Scots pine. A forest canopy reflectance model (Kuusk and Nilson, 2000) has been used to simulate stand reflectances in the Landsat ETM+ wavelength bands as a means of investigating the theoretical reflectance response to LAI changes. The analysis shows that the response to changes in LAI is strongest in the visible wavelength bands, particularly Channel 3, whereas only weak response is noted in the NIR band and for some vegetation indices [simple ratio (SR) and NDVI]. Modelled reflectances are influenced by various other factors, particularly ground reflectance and leaf biochemical properties. Observed reflectances from the Landsat ETM+ sensor have been compared with reflectance modelling results and with field-based LAI estimates. The results indicate that LAI estimation using inverse canopy reflectance modelling may be difficult, given the large number of input parameters required and the current level of uncertainty in these parameters. Statistical relationships between LAI and observed ETM+ reflectances are strongest in ETM+ Channel 7. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SPECTRAL IRRADIANCE
AB The need is identified for a unified approach to the preflight and in-flight absolute radiometric calibration of satellite sensors, which does not depend on the accurate transfer of lamp and detector calibrations from the laboratory to orbit. Such an approach is described that uses the sun to provide the link between preflight solar radiation-based calibration (SRBC), in-flight solar diffuser-based calibration, and vicarious calibration. Examples are given of these methods and uncertainty estimates are provided. It is shown that an uncertainty with respect to solar exoatmospheric irradiance, of <3%, 1 sigma, can be attained for each method and that each can, if needed, be accurately related to national laboratory standards. In addition to providing the link between preflight and in-flight on-board calibrations, this unified approach also fills the critical need to relate these calibrations to those of the radiometers used for vicarious calibration and data-product, field-validation measurements, by also referencing them to the same solar-irradiance scale.

ID BURNED AREAS; RESOLUTION; SENSITIVITY; REFLECTANCE; ALGORITHM
AB Often, little importance is given to the problem of how uncertainty propagates in models driven by remotely sensed data, and what the effects of uncertainty might be on the output of these models. In this paper, a general procedure to support a characterisation of uncertainty in the generation of remote sensing (RS) products is proposed. The procedure can be used with models characterised by any degree of complexity and driven by any kind of data. It provides two useful tools to analyse models: uncertainty analysis (UA), which allows the assessment of the uncertainty associated with model output, and sensitivity analysis (SA), which is useful to determine how much each source of uncertainty contributes to model output uncertainty. Uncertainty modelling, i.e. finding suitable tools to represent uncertainty, is a key step in performing UA and SA. A general error model for quantitative raster data is described. Different applications of UA and SA are proposed, and, in the last part of the paper, an example of UA and SA on a model for burned area detection is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Various subtle but important digitization round-off and noise errors are found in SeaWiFS imagery. These errors often cause large relative errors at a pixel and cause pixelization or "speckling" across the image, which is particularly obvious in the SeaWiFS chlorophyll standard product. Using simulations and current SeaWiFS algorithms, we show the effect of digitization-noise errors on the SeaWiFS ocean-color data products. It is found that the SeaWiFS mission goals, namely to estimate water-leaving radiances to within +/-5% and chlorophyll-a concentrations to within +/- 35% for Case I waters, cannot always be met. For maritime aerosol conditions the errors in the estimated chlorophyll concentrations over oligotrophic waters can easily reach +/- 60% and the absolute values over adjacent pixels can vary 2-3 fold. Several schemes can be used to reduce this type of error, among which the spatial smoothing of the atmospheric-correction bands is recommended. This is because the errors in these bands are propagated and exaggerated to the visible bands and to the chlorophyll product through the atmospheric-correction process. The smoothing scheme, however, will cause more pixels to be discarded over cloud edges. Ultimately, a significant increase in both digitization bits and sensitivity is essential to achieve the stated mission goals. Such improved specifications are available on MODIS.

ID INTERNAL WAVES; PHOTOGRAPHS
AB We observed oil slicks along a ship wake in the northern Arabian Sea. The slicks were recorded on photographs taken by astronauts onboard Space Shuttle Columbia during mission STS62 in March 1994. The longest slick had a length of 21.25 km and an average width of 1.67 km. The total volume of oil discharged into the sea was estimated at 108 +/- 37 m(3) assuming a reasonable thickness of the oil film to be 3 +/- 1 mum. The oil slick width increased with the distance from the ship. This image feature was converted into information in the time domain with the ship speed being a conversion parameter. Using this method, we determined that the average oil slick spreading velocity with respect to the ship wake was 13.6 cm s(-1). The analysis indicated that turbulent diffusion and wind drag were the dominant forcing for the oil slick spreading. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID SURFACE; ABSORPTION; IRRADIANCE
AB Combining direct reception of satellite data, supercomputing and computer networking, we developed a system to distribute satellite products to users in real-time. Geostationary meteorological satellite (GMS) data is received every hour, and high-spatial resolution images of incident solar radiation are produced. The hourly solar radiation is obtained for 0.01 degrees grids, which meets requirements of the agricultural applications in the northern Japan. The estimated daily values are validated by ground measurements, which show a root-mean square (rms) error of about 8-14%. Several products of solar radiation are produced immediately after the hourly GMS data reception and are then transferred to the web server for on-line access from the users. Consequently, the satellite products can be obtained through the World Wide Web within 5 min after the data reception, which can be classified as real-time distribution. The system has been continuously operated since June 1997, and it has proved that the real-time monitoring of the earth surface using satellite products may be possible using systems integrating advanced technologies.

AB Cross-calibration of the AVHRR shortwave channels against the ATSR-2 is not straightforward because the spectral responses functions of the sensors differ and because the sensors generally view targets from different directional reflectance of the target. Evidence is presented to show that uncertainties caused by the directional mismatch may be reduced if the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (RBDF) estimated from AVHRR data is used to map AVHRR reflectances to the ATSR-2 geometrical configuration. A stochastic model is developed to study the impact on the correlation between ATSR-2 and AVHRR radiances caused by 1) the response of vegetation to rainfall in a semi-arid region, 2) errors in the BRDF model used to map AVHRR reflectances to ATSR-2 geometry, 3) spatial nonuniformity of the target, and 4) variations in the column water vapor. The model shows that spatial nonuniformity contributes most of the error, but that the cross-calibration to 1% or better is possible provided that the coefficient of spatial variation is 2.5% or less and the sensor remains stable. However, determination of the rate of calibration drift is problematic, with errors of the order of 20% in the rate of drift even when the data span a full year. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.

AB For a better evaluation of the accuracy of VIs in estimating biophysical parameters, a "true" VI value attributed only to the vegetation signal and free of any contamination is needed. In this article, pure vegetation spectra were extracted from a set of open and closed canopies by unmixing the green vegetation signal from the background component. Canopy model-simulation and reflectances derived from graph-based linear extrapolation were used to unmix and derive a "true" vegetation signal, equivalent to a perfect absorber (free boundary) canopy background reflectance condition. Optical-biophysical relationships were then derived for a variety of canopy structures with differences in foliage clumping, horizontal heterogeneity, and leaf type. A 3-dimensional canopy radiative transfer model and a hybrid geometric optical-radiative transfer model (GORT) were used to simulate the directional-hemispherical reflectances from agricultural, grassland, and forested canopies (cereal and broadleaf crop, grass, needleleaf, and broadleaf forest). The relationships of the extracted red and near-infrared reflectances and derived vegetation indices (VIs) to various biophysical parameters (leaf area index, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, and percent ground cover) were examined for the pure vegetation spectra. The results showed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) relationships with biophysical parameters to become more asymptotic over the pure vegetation conditions. The extraction of pure vegetation signals had little effect on the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), which had values equivalent to those obtained with the presence of a background signal. NDVI values were fairly uniform across the different canopy types, whereas the SAVI values had pronounced differences among canopy types, particularly between the broadleaf and cereal/needleleaf structural types. These results were useful not only in selecting suitable vegetation indices to characterize specific canopy biophysical parameters, but also in understanding a "true" VI behavior, free of background noise.

AB A remote sensing method utilizing multiband thermal infrared (8-12 mum) imagery that discriminates between sensecent vegetation and bare soil is described. This discrimination is achieved by computing thermal band emissivities from a temperature-emissivity separation algorithm, and then classifying surface features based on spectral emissivity contrast. In a study of rangelands and winter wheat fields in central Oklahoma, the contrast, or range, of these spectral emissivities is diagnostic of the presence or absence of surface vegetative cover. A large range of emissivities, approximately greater than 0.03, is indicative of bare soil, while a low range, less than 0.02, is indicative of vegetative cover. When knowledge of the emissivity range is combined with a vegetation index, such as NDVI, the surface may be classified by a ternary system: bare soil, green vegetation, and senescent vegetation. Discrimination between bare soil and soil covered with senescent vegetation using emissivity contrast should be feasible in other settings. The benefit of this technique is that heat flux predictions can be based on a more accurate surface representation than otherwise provided by visible and near-infrared land classification schemes.

ID SATELLITE
AB Sequential imagery from the AVHRR has been used to conduct ocean feature tracking since the early 1980s. One of the primary limitations of AVHRR data for feature tracking is the lack of temporal continuity, since it is only possible to obtain coverage from the same satellite once every 12 hours. Thus, for the highly variable flows that are often encountered in coastal areas, undersampling can be a serious problem. With the availability of imagery every half hour from the new imager on the GOES-8 and -10 satellites. the possibility of tracking features on shorter time scales should be considered. Also, the higher sampling rate of the GOES imager could be particularly beneficial in obtaining cloud-free coverage of the ocean. However, unlike the AVHRR, which has 1-km resolution, the new imager on GOES has 4-km resolution in the infrared channels. Thus, even for relatively vigorous currents, It will take at least several hours for a feature to be advected over a distance of one pixel, and considerably longer to generate displacements that can be estimated reliably. Also, one of the basic assumptions in conducting ocean feature tracking has been that it is the submesoscale features that serve as the primary tracers of the flow. As pixel size increases, the ability to resolve and track features at these scales clearly comes into question. Additionally, as with AVHRR imagery, the ability to accurately navigate successive images is crucial to making reliable estimates of the feature displacements. These and other related issues are discussed, and three examples of feature tracking using imagery from the imager on GOES-8 are presented, together with qualitative verifications in each case. Finally, a new method for rapidly renavigating satellite imagery is presented. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is widely accepted as a good indicator for providing vegetation properties and associated changes for large scale geographic regions. Using multivariate time series data analysis methods based on principal component transform and wavelet decomposition, a sequence of 11-year monthly Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-derived NDVI data from 1982 to 1992 is examined to study the vegetation and climate variation trends over the United States. We find that one interannual NDVI variation signal over the United Stares, exhibits a strong relationship with the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index, which is a measure of the phase and amplitude of the Southern Oscillations (SOs). The corresponding spatial patterns of NDT anomaly are also extracted for mapping the possible impacts of ENSO activity. The NDVI anomaly patterns approximately agree with the main documented precipitation and temperature anomaly patterns associated with ENSO, but also show additional patterns not related to ENSO. This study shows that ENSO activity effects may have regionally significant effects for vegetation in the United States. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

TI Extension of the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks to

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The microwave emission model of layered snowpacks (MEMLS) is a multilayer and multiple-scattering radiative transfer model developed for dry winter snow using an empirical parametrization of the scattering coefficient (se the copanion article). A limitation is in the applicable range of frequencies and correlation lengths. In order to extend the model, a physical determination of the volume-scattering coefficients, describing the coupling between the six fluxes, is developed here, based on the improved Born approximation. An exponential spatial autocorrelation function was selected. With this addition, MEMLS obtains a complete physical basis. The extended model is void of free parameters. The validation was none with two types of experiments made at the alpine test site, Weissfluhjoch: 1) radiometry at 11 GHz, 21 GHz, 35 GHz, 48 GHz, and 94 GHz of winter snow samples on a blackbody and on a metal plate, respectively, and 2) radiometric monitoring at 4.9 GHz, 10.4 GHz, 21 GHz, 35 GHz, and 94 GHz of coarse-grained crusts growing and decaying during melt-and-refreeze cycles. Digitized snow sections were used to measure snow structure in both experiments. The coarsest grains were found in the refrozen crusts with a correlation length up to 0.71 min; the winter snow samples had smaller values, from 0.035 mm for new snow to about 0.33 mm for depth hoar. Good results have been obtained in all cases studied so far. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB This study describes the methodology developed to detect burned surfaces using a long-time series of low-resolution satellite data. NOAA-AVHRR-GAC 5 Km images were used because they constitute a very complete historical data set of satellite imagery over Africa. The Burned Area Algorithm (BAA) relies on a multitemporal multithreshold approach, based on the spectral changes of the land surface after a fire occurrence. By using different sets of AVHRR channels and derived Indices, spectral signatures have been determined for burned and unburned surfaces. Indices that make use of the information contained in Channel 2 and Channel 3 are the best for detecting burned areas. The results showed excellent agreement at the continental scale with known temporal and spatial patterns of active fires. Validation of the algorithm by comparison with a number of Landsat TM images, which were classified in terms of burned and unburned surfaces, showed an overall accuracy of 71%.

ID SCATTERING MODEL; C-BAND; SOIL; VEGETATION; CAMPAIGN; GROWTH; AREA
AB An agroecological approach is presented to simulate time series of ERS SAR radar backscatter of agricultural crops from integrated crop growth (SUCROS), water balance (SAHEL), and radar backscatter (Cloud) modeling. SUCROS is used to calculate the amount of water in canopies and SAHEL the amount of water in the top soil, which serve both as driving variables for the Cloud model. The methodology was tested on three years of ERS SAR observations, 1992-1994, over an agricultural area in Flevoland, The Netherlands. Area-average model input data and radar backscatter values per crop type were used. Observed temporal radar backscatter curves of sugar beet, potato, and winter wheat were reproduced well with 1-2 dB accuracy in all three years using the same set of SUCROS, SAHEL, and Cloud model parameters per crop type each year. Main reasons for success were the use of "area-average" instead of "field-average" data, the flatness of the area, the relative homogeneity in agroecological conditions and the near-potential growing conditions.

AB Remotely sensed land surface reflectance depends upon changing sun and sensor viewing geometry, and this dependence is governed by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Because the reflectance distribution of vegetation is strongly anisotropic, multi-view angle (MVA) observations of terrestrial ecosystems contain additional and unique information beyond that acquired with nadir or single-angle spectral measurements alone. With the NASA EOS instruments MODIS and MISR and France's POLDER, new capabilities in MVA remote sensing will become widely available or ecological, biogeochemical, and land-surface biophysical research. However, a communication gap exists between the remote sensing and ecological communities in terms of the capabilities of the former and the needs of the latter. In this article, we present a summary of ecological research needs for remotely sensed data. Based on these needs, we present a review of some of the most promising MVA remote sensing methods for fulfilling these requirements. With this article, we hope to facilitate increased communication between the remote sensing, ecological, and biogeochemical research communities. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

TI Subpixel land use classification and retrieval of forest stem volume in

ID AVHRR DATA; BIOMASS; BACKSCATTER; IMAGERY
AB The use of microwave radiometry for the retrieval of land use distribution (subpixel proportions) and forest stem volume for 25 km and 50 km pixels is investigated, with new algorithms introduced for the spaceborne multichannel SSM/I instrument. The test sites are located in the boreal forest zone in Finland. SSM/I data from snow-free periods (from May to September) are used in the study, together with a digital high-resolution land use map as reference data. A stepwise algorithm is developed, in which the surface emissivity is estimated for each of the pixels in the first stage of the algorithm. By using a training data set (50% of all data), empirical coefficients for the subpixel land use and forest stem volume are determined. The results for subpixel land use classification (retrieval of fractions of individual land use categories contained within study pixels) are promising. When there are two or three categories to retrieve, the rms errors range from 3% to 9%, and the respective relative errors from 3% to 32%. When there are six categories to retrieve, the performance is less satisfactory with relative errors exceeding 100% for some categories. For the retrieval of forest stem volume, a similar approach is sued. The validation data set shows rms errors (standard errors) of approximately 20 m(3)/ha when the mean estimated forest stem volume is around 70 m(3)/ha. When compared to reported Landsat TM-based biomass estimates for a study area in Finland, the r(2) (coefficient of determination) values are comparable. The methods are also validated for a wider use by limiting the training data set to either northern or southern Finland, since the surface and forest types in these areas are systematically different (subgroups of boreal forests). The results show that the methods are applicable to remote areas with less training data. This is especially true for the stem volume estimation and limited (two or three classes) subpixel land use classification. These can be considered as promising results for a course resolution, high-frequency microwave instrument such as the SSM/I. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

TI Requirements for satellite land surface temperature validation using a
   silt playa
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID EMISSIVITY
AB We investigate the validation of satellite land surface temperature (LST) products. In particular, the planned EOS/MODUS global LST accuracy of 1 degrees C must be confirmed by independent measurements for a range of cover types. Simple flat surfaces are the most easily instrumented and characterized and so provide a logical starting point. Such surfaces include inland water, sand, snow, ice, and playa. Validation with water is straight-forward, but other land surfaces are more difficult to measure accurately. The analysis we present is based on a sequence of MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) images collected over a playa (silt dry lake bed). Atmospheric effects in the MAS images are corrected by an in-scene method and are then converted to a time sequence of temperature maps. These form the basis for estimating the spatial and temporal sampling requirements to achieve a surface measurement accuracy of better than 0.5 degrees C for 1 km(2) MODIS pixels. We conclude that a grid of thermistors appears to be the most practical instrumentation method for such a large area. Depending on the environmental conditions, between 4 and 16 points are required per km(2), and we recommend that these be sampled at intervals ranging from 1 min to 2.5 min. A MAS underflight validation is possible if it is synchronized to within several minutes of the MODIS overpass. Finally, radiometers should be used at several of the thermistor locations to verify the skin temperature corrections and to characterize the temperature transients and angular effects.

AB When excited at 280 nm, (intact vegetation produced two overlapping broadband fluorescence emissions; the first centered near 335 nm [ultraviolet (UV) band], and the second centered near 440 nm (blue band). Separation of these two fluorescence bands was achieved by an iterative nonlinear curve fit procedure utilizing the asymmetric double sigmoidal spectral function. The subsequent ratio of the deconvoluted curve intensities exhibited a significant relation between protein concentration and fluorescence. UV band fluorescence from vegetation treated with varying levels of nitrogen fertilization decreased relative to the blue fluorescence as a function of protein levels. These studies indicate that in vivo UV band fluorescence can be utilized as a nondestructive tool to remotely sense variations in protein concentration due to nitrogen supply. Strong similarities were noted in the UV band fluorescence characteristics of intact vegetation to both membrane-bound and soluble plant proteins containing aromatic amino acids. Pure ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase in aqueous solution exhibited UV fluorescence characteristics with excitation and emission distributions similar to those of intact vegetation. Because of its high concentration (up to 70% of the soluble leaf proteins), roe believe this protein contributes to the UV band fluorescence emnnating from the intact leaf. In, addition, similar fluorescence characteristics were observed for two other prominent enzymatic plant proteins; namely, adenosine 5'-tri-phosphatase and carboxylase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxcylase. These results indicate that UV band fluorescence emanating from the intact leaf could originate front several plant proteins that contain aromatic amino acids. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Above-ground woody biomass ii nn important parameter for describing the function and productivity of forested ecosystems. Recent studies have demonstrated that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can be used to estimate above-ground standing biomass. To date, these studies have relied on extensive ground-truth measurements to construct relationships between biomass and SAR backscatter. In this article toe discuss the use of models to help develop a relationship between biomass and radar backscatter and compare the predictions ruth measurements. A gap-type forest succession model was used to simulate growth and development of a northern hardwood-boreal transitional Sorest typical of central Maine, USA. Model results of species, and bole diameter at breast height (dbh) of individual trees in a 900 m(2) stand I were used to run discontinuous canopy backscatter models to determine radar backscatter coefficients for a wide range of simulated forest stands. Using model results, relationships of copolarized backscatter to forest biomass were developed and applied to an airborne SAR (AIRSAR) image over a forested area in Maine. A relationship derived totally from model results was found to underestimate biomass. Calibrating the modeled backscatter with limited AIRSAR backscatter measurements improved the biomass estimation when compared to field measurements. The approach of rising a combination of forest succession and remote sensing models to develop algorithms for inferring forest attributes produced comparable results with techniques using only measurements. Applying the model derived algorithm to SAR imagery produced reasonable results when mapped biomass was limited to 15 kg/m(2) or less. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID MAP ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; REMOTELY SENSED DATA
AB This article presents a comparison of the performance of TM and SPOT data for cover type mapping on the Central Sierra of Spain. A novel multi-stage iterative classification, and four single-step classifications are performed for each type of data. The single-stage classifications differ from one another in the band selection process, the use or not of prior probabilities, and/or the supervised or unsupervised nature of the classification. The accuracy of each classification method and data type (TM vs. SPOT) is expressed as an error matrix from which K statistics and their large sample variances are derived. The values of the K statistics are used to compare the performance of the classification methods, two at time, by means of a Z statistic. Results from this research show that the iterative classification approach is superior to any other classification for both types of remotely sensed data. TM data proves superior to SPOT data only when the iterative classification approach is used. Overall comparison of the performance of TM and SPOT data shows that there is not a statistically significant difference between these types of data for large-scale cover type mapping.

AB The commissioning of a NOAA satellite receiving station at Townsville in North Queensland in 1988 greatly expanded the AVHRR coverage of the northeast Australian region to include the entire Great Barrier Reef system and marginal seas. Selected imagery from this and a southern station installed previously at Aspendale, Victoria provide a valuable new perspective on oceanographic phenomena occurring in this ecologically significant region. This perspective could not be attained using conventional ship-board and in situ oceanographic sampling techniques. A rich spectrum of mesoscale oceanographic features is revealed in the analyzed imagery, and various features such as western boundary current meanders, frontal shear waves, eddies, and jets are described. The temporal and spatial variability of these features appears strongly linked to that of the larger-scale Coral Sea current circulation. Several of the features identified are unique to the region, others resemble features observed in other western boundary current systems, but are significantly modified by the complex regional topography, and by the presence of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Evidence has been found for a number of processes which have significant implications for the origin and maintenance of CBR ecosystems, including shelf edge exchange processes, stratified slope water intrusions onto the shelf, and boundary layer mixing around reefs. Such processes provide a mechanism for injection of cool nutrient-rich waters into the reef matrix. The imagery provides a clear picture of a well-organized, but spatially complex, frontal system existing in the southern Coral Sea, which is associated with enhanced commercial and recreational fishing activity in the region. The AVHRR imagery has thus proven to be a valuable tool for spatial mapping of oceanographic features throughout the CBR region, for hypothesis formation in dynamical and modeling studies, and for ship-board reconnaissance operations.

AB The sensitivity of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to soil background and atmospheric effects has generated an increasing interest in the development of new indices, such as the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) transformed soil-adjusted vegetation index (TSAVI), atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI), global environment monitoring index (GEMI) modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), which are less sensitive to these external influences. These indices are theoretically more reliable than NDVI, although they are not yet widely used with satellite data. This article focuses on testing and comparing the sensitivity of NDVI, SAVI, TSAVI, MSAVI and GEMI to soil background effects. Indices are simulated with the SAIL model for a large range of soil reflectances, including sand, clay, and dark peat, with additional variations induced by moisture and roughness. The general formulation of the SAVI family of indices with the form VI = (NIR - R)/(NIR + R + X) is also reexamined. The value of the parameter X is critical in the minimization of soil effects. A value of X = 0.16 is found as the optimized value. Index performances are compared by means of an analysis of variance.

ID VARZEA FORESTS; VEGETATION; SCATTERING; DYNAMICS
AB To understand the potential of using multiwavelength imaging radars to detect flooding in Amazonian floodplain forests, we simulated the radar backscatter from a flood plain forest with a flooded or nonflooded ground condition at C-, L-, and P-bands. Field measurements of forest structure in the Anavilhanas archipelago of the Negro River, Brazil, were used as inputs to the model. Given the same wavelength or incidence angle, the ratio of backscatter from the flooded forest to that from the nonflooded forest was higher at HH polarization than at VV polarization. Given the same wavelength or polarization, the ratio was larger at small incidence angles than at large incidence angles. Given the same polarization or incidence angle, the ratio was larger at a long wavelength than at a short wavelength. As the surface soil moisture underneath the nonflooded forest increased from 10% to 50% of volumetric moisture, the flooded/nonflooded backscatter ratio decreased; the decreases were small at C- and L-band but large at P-band. When the leaf size was comparable to or larger than the wavelength of C-band, the leaf area index (LAI) had a large effect on the simulated C-band (not L-band or P-band) backscatter from the flooded and nonflooded forests.

TI PREDICTING PHYTOPLANKTON COMPOSITION FROM SPACE - USING THE RATIO OF
   EUPHOTIC DEPTH TO MIXED-LAYER DEPTH - AN EVALUATION
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID WATERS
AB A technique to remotely characterize the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton would have application in several fields of environmental study. Satellite imagery available presently and in the near future will likely not be able to accomplish this, except in unique cases, using spectral methods. As an alternative approach, we empirically evaluated a technique that uses the ratio of euphotic depth (Z(eu)) to mixed-layer depth (Z(m)) as a parameter to predict the relative abundance of three major algal groups-diatoms, dinoflagellates, and coccolithophores in the surface layer of the temperate North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. The ratio can be ascertained without in situ measurements; Z(eu) can be estimated from ocean color imagery, and Z(m) can be derived from hydrographic models. Diatoms were found to dominate the phytoplankton community, in terms of cell concentration, at stations possessing significantly greater values of the ratio Z(eu):Z(m) than those stations where dinoflagellates dominated This is contrary to the generally accepted view that diatoms occupy less stratified water columns than dinoflagellates. The result, which may merely reflect the data set employed and as such requires further testing could aid in classifying the phytoplankton on a regional basis. However, we conclude that the use of the ratio Z(eu):Z(m) is not likely to provide a general; nonspectral technique to characterize the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton.

TI AIRBORNE LASER ALTIMETER MEASUREMENTS OF LANDSCAPE TOPOGRAPHY
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Measurements of topography can provide a wealth of information on landscape properties for managing hydrologic and geologic systems and conserving natural and agricultural resources. This article discusses the application of an airborne laser altimeter to measure topography and other landscape surface properties. The airborne laser altimeter makes 4000 measurements per second with a vertical recording resolution of 5 cm. Data are collected digitally with a personal computer. A video camera, borehole sighted with the laser, records an image for locating flight lines. CPS data are used to locate flight line positions on the landscape. Laser data were used to measure vegetation canopy topography, height, cover and distribution and to measure microtopography of the land surface and gullies with depths of 15-20 cm. Macrotopography of landscape profiles for segments up to 4 km were in agreement with available topographic maps but provided more detail. Larger gullies with and without vegetation, and stream channel cross sections and their associated floodplains have also been measured and reported in other publications. Landscape segments for any length could be measured for either micro- or macrotopography. Airborne laser altimeter measurements of landscape profiles can provide detailed information on landscape properties or specific needs that will allow better decisions on the design and location of structures (i.e., roads, pipe, and power lines) and for improving the management and conservation of natural and agricultural landscapes.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID HIGH-RESOLUTION RADIOMETER; SATELLITE; VAPOR; EMISSIVITY; CHANNELS
AB Atmospheric correction to near-infrared reflectances for land surface studies requires information about precipitable water. A relation between the split window temperature difference (Delta T) and atmosphere precipitable water (W) over land surfaces is developed from the radiative transfer equation considering spectral variation of the emissivity. This relation is found to be essentially linear with slope and intercept being dependent on the emissivity. The observed Delta T (from NOAA-9 AVHRR data for 10.1-11.5 mu m and 11.2-12.6 mu m channels) and W (from radiosonde data) for 1 year (1988) at 24 globally distributed locations of various surface types (hot and temperate deserts, savannas, temperature deciduous forest, rainforest, boreal forest, etc.) were analyzed to assess the relation between Delta T and W and compared with the theoretical results. These globally distributed data were segregated into specified ranges of visible reflectance (from the AVHRR corresponding to Delta T data) so as to minimize emissivity variations in determining the slope and the intercept of the Delta T-W relationship and in estimating emissivity. Both the theory and the observations demonstrate the feasibility of estimating W from Delta T over vegetated surfaces, although a priori knowledge of emissivity will be needed for a wider application.

TI A SAR IMAGE STUDY OF A SNOW-COVERED AREA IN THE FRENCH ALPS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID MICROWAVE
AB Two radar experiments were performed in the French Alps in December 1989 and April 1990. The main objective was to study the signature of snow-covered terrain for different snow conditions. The E-SAR (Band X) from DLR was used, and the data were processed by CNES. The study area was situated at Les Arcs, a ski resort, with elevations ranging from 1600 m to 2600 m. Ground data included snow depth, liquid water content, and snow and air temperature. A SPOT image was available for December and aerial photographs for the following July. In December there was almost no snow, while in April the area was completely snow covered. Because of the highly varying topography, a DEM (digital elevation model) was used to correct the image geometrically and radiometrically. A simple scheme was developed for these corrections. The snow was slightly wet in April and many features appearing on the image are due to the snow itself or to the snow-ground interface. In particular, the ski runs are clearly visible due to the different structure of the packed snow. Only a small area could be compared between December and April due to technical problems in December. It appears that the snow-free and snow-covered signatures are very similar for this particular terrain, which is a golf course in summer; that is, smooth wet soil with short grass. These experiments show that are necessary when studying mountainous area. Furthermore calibrated data are required to compare snow-free and snow-covered terrain when the snow is slightly wet and therefore slightly absorbant with respect to the electromagnetic waves.

AB Remote sensing technology to study vegetative canopies by measuring optical, thermal, and microwave signatures provides optimism for frequent characterization of plant performance in the field. Ground truth data are required in the calibration and the validation of satellite data. The objective of this work was to measure canopy temperature (CT), canopy photosynthesis (CER), and evapotranspiration (ET) of spring wheat (Triticum durum Desf. ''Aldente'') irrigated at two levels. A large portable field chamber (volume of 3.25 m(3) and an area of 2.67 m(2)) enclosed the canopy, and CO2 and water vapor concentrations were measured at 2-s intervals for 60 s with an infrared gas analyzer operated in differential mode. Canopy temperature was measured with an infrared thermometer (4 degrees FOV; 0.15 m dia spot size) mounted on the outside front corner of the chamber aimed 3 m directly in front of the chamber and represents the mean of 15 measurements. Other estimates of CT were obtained from a fixed infrared thermometer at the weather station and from low flying aircraft. Diurnal measurements were completed on 10 April 1989 when the wheat was in midflowering (Zadoks scale 65). Diurnal trends in CER showed differences between fully irrigated and deficit-irrigated plots. The small differences in ET and CT between irrigated and deficit-irrigated plots suggested minimum plant stress on deficit-irrigated plots, at least during the early part of the day. The cumulative daytime photosynthesis showed the irrigated plots averaged 28.9 g CO2 m(-2) while the deficit-irrigated plots showed a 52% reduction in CER. The CT ranged from about 7 degrees C near sunrise through a maximum of 27 degrees C and then decreased to 15 degrees C at sundown. The average cumulative daytime chamber ET was 8.41 mm and 7.69 mm for the fully and deficit-irrigated plots, respectively, which compared with reference ET of 8.91 mm and aircraft estimate of 8.93 mm. Diurnal trends in CT and ET showed a stronger association and were similar for both irrigated and deficit-irrigated plots.

The location of the MS bands were done with respect to the suitibility of these spectral regions to analyze vegetation type and status. The calculations of the spectral significance for thematic data evaluation is based on spectroscopic field measurements of crops, balanced with an atmospheric transmission model (Lowtran 7), and the system parameters. The simulation results lead to the conclusion that the spatial, spectral, and radiometric resolution, combined with the on-track stereo capability of the MOMS-02 sensor, will result in substantial improvements in vegetation classification compared to concurrent remote sensing instruments like Landsat TM and Spot HRV.

AB Reflectance factor spectra in the visible, near, and mid-infrared ranges from canopies of rice plantings that were flooded throughout the crop season (controls) were compared with the treatment drained on a predetermined date, and sheltered from rainfall, to induce water stress. Spectra sampled at 5 nm intervals in the 400-900 nm range and 10 nm intervals in the 900-1900 nm range and their first derivatives were statistically analyzed by ANOVA for two sources of variation, cultivars and water stress, each measurement date. Near infrared (1190-1320 nm) and mid-infrared (1600 nm) band reflectances, and the first derivative at 1230 nm responded promptly to the removal of paddy surface water even for complete ground cover (LAI = 5) during vegetative development. The first derivative at 960 nm, corresponding to a small water absorption band, detected the water status Of canopies about 10 days after drainage. Response in the first derivative preceded by a few days the leaf water content deficit, the visual symptoms of wilting and leaf roll, and the decrease in visible red (RED) and near infrared (NIR) reflectances expressed as the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED). Findings indicate that high spectral resolution reflectance measurements and their first derivatives in near and mid-infrared ranges offer a promising method for early detection Of water stress in rice canopies.

TI SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF A BARLEY CANOPY IN RELATION TO THE SPECTRAL
   PROPERTIES OF SINGLE LEAVES AND THE SOIL
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID LEAF-AREA; REFLECTANCE; RED
AB Spectral reflectance of a barley crop was studied in relation to the spectral properties of soil and leaves in order to evaluate the stability and dynamics of leaf optical properties in seasonal canopy-soil background reflectance. On nine dates during the growing season reflectance in the 400-1100 nm spectrum of a barley canopy was measured with a Licor 1800 spectroradiometer. Canopy reflectance was studied in relation to phenological development stages, dry and wet soil spectral reflectance, and green peak and red minimum reflectance characteristics of single barley leaves. Different leaves in the canopy were spectrally similar and the parameters of the green peak and the red minimum were stable. Based on reflectance characteristics, the growing season could be divided into four distinct Feekes scale phenological periods: 1) F = 1-3, emergence sprouting to initial tillering. The spectral characteristics of leaves could not be identified in canopy reflectance and multitemporal measurements of reflectance at constant soil moisture content are needed to extract optimal information on crop development. The best early season spectral information on plants was obtained in the visible region with a dry soil background; wet soil as a background gave high contrast between canopy and soil reflectance in the near infrared region of the spectrum. 2) F = 4-10.4, tiller elongation to ear emergence. Spectral characteristics of leaves could be identified in total canopy reflectance, except the red edge parameters which were influenced by canopy structure. Measuring spectral reflectance of the canopy during this period gave information on plant parameters independent of background reflectance. 3) F = 10.5-11.2, grain filling. During this period only small changes in reflectance were registered. A shift in the green peak towards longer wave-lengths indicated that ear reflectance and senescent tissue became relatively more important in total canopy reflectance than leaf reflectance. 4) F = 11.2-11.4, canopy senescence period corresponding to grain dry down. The spectral characteristic of green tissue disappeared in the reflectance spectrum of the canopy.

AB A modified AVHRR multispectral imaging instrument is to be flown on the NOAA polar-orbiting satellites beginning with NOAA-K, and is designated AVHRR-K / L / M.  The instrument will include a narrowed near-visible Channel 2 centered at 0.85-mu-m, and a new near-infrared Channel 3A centered at 1.6-mu-m.  In this study, we describe a retrieval method for marine stratus cloud droplets size which utilizes the radiance measurements in these channels.  Factors which influence the sensitivity and accuracy of the estimation method are discussed, and results of model simulations designed to test the method are presented.  Potential retrieval errors due to haze within the boundary layer are identified.  It is concluded that the effective radius of the cloud droplet size distribution can be retrieved for clouds of optical depth seven or greater which fill the AVHRR radiometer field of view.

TI THERMAL INFRARED RADIANCE MODEL FOR INTERPRETING THE DIRECTIONAL

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID ROW
AB In this work we have proposed a two-dimensional radiance model that serves for interpreting the directional remotely-sensed thermal infrared data obtained over a vegetative surface when the effects of the shadows are minimal.  The model was validated for different view angles from the measurements made with a radiometer placed on board a helicopter in two different citrus regions.  And the root-mean-square deviation between the model predictions and the sensor measurements was 0.3-degrees-C.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Accurate building heights are essential to understand the mechanisms of urban systems and provide new insights into research on infrastructure equality, urban environment, population modeling, etc. However, relatively few studies have been conducted to estimate high-resolution building heights using Chinese GaoFen-7 imagery across multiple cities. In this study, we developed an effective Building Height Estimation method by synergizing Photogrammetry and Deep learning methods (BHEPD) to leverage Chinese multi-view GaoFen-7 (GF-7) images for high-resolution building height estimation. In particular, BHEPD incorporates the StereoNet model and is capable of generating an edge-preserving digital surface model (DSM) from GF-7 images. This improvement enhances the accuracy of heights estimation, particularly for high-rise, high-density, and multi-scale buildings. BHEPD extracted over 700,000 building heights in local areas of Tianjin, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Ningbo, Guangzhou, Foshan, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. The estimated building heights in the different cities are highly consistent with the reference building height data obtained from field-measured building height data, building floor data, and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The R-2 varies from 0.75 to 0.90, while the root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 4.06 m to 8.06 m. The validation of the estimated building heights over 106,366 buildings using airborne LiDAR height data yielded R-2 and RMSE of 0.90 and 6.72 m for Shenzhen and 0.89 and 4.06 m for Hong Kong, respectively. Furthermore, a comparison with the building height estimation based on the traditional DSM generation method (i.e., semi-global matching (SGM) algorithm) confirmed the superiority of BHEPD in alleviating the underestimation of high-rise buildings (>60 m). Overall, BHEPD shows great potential for high-resolution building height estimation and can be expected to reduce the manual workload involved in collecting building height information on large scale.

AB Remotely sensed spectral diversity has emerged as a promising proxy for plant diversity. However, spectral diversity approaches relate image spectra to plant community diversity by only incorporating variation among adjacent pixels, considering each pixel as a homogeneous entity composed of one class, and disregarding the within-pixel variability. Although such approaches might work for remotely-sensed data with fine spatial resolution, they might not be viable solutions to estimate plant diversity using coarse-resolution data from forthcoming spaceborne imagers. To address the limitations associated with spectral diversity approaches, we proposed a novel approach, known as endmember diversity, for remote estimation of plant diversity through quantifying spectral diversity at the sub-pixel level and taking into account the within-pixel variability. The approach consisted of deriving the number and abundance of distinct spectral entities within each pixel via spectral unmixing. In doing so, we considered the spectral signature of each pixel as a mixture of distinct spectral entities, commonly known as endmembers. We then used the per-pixel endmembers and their abundance to calculate different spectral diversity metrics for every pixel. We assessed the performance of the endmember diversity approach at estimating plant taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity based on two experiments using a simulated spectral dataset and a real-world spaceborne DESIS (DLR Earth Sensing Imaging Spectrometer) dataset. In both experiments, we found significant associations between endmember diversity and in situ plant diversity. Additionally, our method applied to DESIS data outperformed a conventional spectral diversity metric based on the coefficient of variation when applied to 1-m airborne imaging spectroscopy data. Collectively, our results demonstrate the capability of forthcoming spaceborne imagers to monitor local plant diversity.

AB The interplay between soil moisture and evapotranspiration modulates the water available to sustain soil evaporation and influences canopy stomatal conductance controls on vegetation transpiration. Modeling this behavior remains challenging. Indeed, satellite remote sensing based Penman-Monteith (PM) ET models tend not to directly consider soil moisture constraints on evaporation and transpiration due to a lack of consistent soil moisture data. To address this issue, we modified a PM model to include satellite enhanced surface and root zone soil moisture from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The resulting model was used to produce global 9-km daily ET estimates, including contributing fluxes from soil evaporation, transpiration and evaporation of canopy-intercepted precipitation. The global PM ET estimates were assessed using in situ sap flow and AmeriFlux measurements, upscaled FLUXCOM latent heat flux, as well as against other independent global ET data products (GLEAM, GLDAS, SSEBop, and LandFlux-EVAL). The modelled transpiration showed similar seasonal variation and positive correlation to in situ sap flow measurements available from several forest sites (R-2 = 0.85; p < 0.01). When compared against AmeriFlux data, the PM ET estimates showed favorable agreement with annual ET measurements extracted from 34 diverse sites (R-2 = 0.58; p < 0.01; RMSE = 227 mm yr(-1)). The PM 8-day ET results also reflected a similar hemispheric seasonality as the global FLUXCOM record (R-2 = 0.94-0.98; p < 0.01), while comparisons against other global ET products showed moderate mean differences of between 49 and 107 mm yr(-1 )(11-25%) over the global domain. Our PM ET estimates varied up to 52% in response to SMAP surface soil moisture dynamics, displaying stronger surface (0-5 cm depth) than root zone (0-100 cm) soil moisture sensitivity. While PM ET sensitivity to soil moisture was greater in arid climate regions, it was also significant in humid climate zones, with analysis indicating that the inclusion of soil moisture predominantly acts as a sustaining influence on ET, especially in moisture limited drylands. PM ET sensitivity to temperature was stronger in humid forest regions relative to other climate and land cover regimes. Overall, the model results clarify the influence of soil moisture heterogeneity on the global ET pattern as informed by satellite-based estimates of surface and root zone soil moisture. Potential enhancements to the spatial and vertical resolution of soil moisture inputs are expected to enable further ET improvements through more realistic model representation of soil and plant available water.

AB Infection by the fungus Verticillium dahliae (Vd) and the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) threatens the production of olives (Olea europaea L.) and almonds (Prunus dulcis Mill.) worldwide. Producing symptoms that resemble water stress or nutrient deficiency, infection by these vascular pathogens restricts water and nutrient flow through the xylem. Hyperspectral, narrow-band multispectral, and thermal imagery acquired at a high spatial resolution can detect disease symptoms, even before they are visible, potentially allowing growers to distinguish infected plants from those affected by confounding environmental stresses. Nevertheless, operational detection of vascular disease using high-resolution commercial satellite multispectral images remains to be evaluated. Here, we assessed the capacity of high-resolution Worldview-2 and -3 multispectral imagery to detect Xf and Vd infections in olive and almond orchards in Spain, Italy, and Australia between 2011 and 2021. We compared the accuracy of detecting both pathogens using the satellite imagery with results obtained using aerial highresolution hyperspectral and thermal imaging, with model-inverted plant traits, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and thermal data as a reference. Our results using spectral plant traits to examine disease progression at all stages showed that traits and their importance varied as a function of disease severity. Worldview-2 and -3 detected the disease incidence with overall accuracies ranging from 0.63 to 0.83 and kappa coefficients (& kappa;) ranging from 0.29 to 0.68. Nevertheless, detecting the early stages of disease with multispectral satellite data yielded poorer results, with & kappa; values of 0.22-0.45, compared with & kappa; values of 0.3-0.69 obtained from hyperspectral data. Typical multispectral bandsets available from satellite sensors cannot measure important plant traits such as the blue index NPQI, xanthophyll proxy PRIn, SIF, and anthocyanin levels, thus explaining the poorer results obtained from multispectral satellite data for the early detection of vascular diseases. Adding a thermal-based crop water stress indicator to the satellite data improved the overall accuracies by 10-15% and increased & kappa; by >0.2 units. This work shows that commercial multispectral high-spatial resolution imagery can be used to detect intermediate and advanced Xf and Vd infection, but that the early detection of disease symptoms requires hyperspectral and thermal data.

AB Canopy biophysical variables such as the fraction of canopy cover (fCOVER), fraction of absorbed photosyn-thetically active radiation (fAPAR), and leaf area index (LAI) are widely used for ecosystem modelling and monitoring. The Sentinel-2 mission was designed for systematic global mapping of these variables at 20 m resolution using imagery from the MultiSpectral Instrument. The Simplified Level 2 Prototype Processor (SL2P) is available as a baseline mapping solution. Previous validation over limited sites indicates that SL2P generally satisfies user requirements for all three variables over crops, but underestimates LAI over forests. In this study, Sentinel-2 fAPAR, fCOVER, and LAI products, from SL2P, were validated over 281 sites representative of most North American forest ecozones and also compared to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) products. In addition to meeting the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites Stage 3 validation requirements for these areas, our study also explores the relationship between bias in SL2P products and canopy clumping and provides empirical bias correction functions for each variable.
   SL2P was implemented within the Landscape Evolution and Forecasting Toolbox in Google Earth Engine both for efficiency and due to bugs in the Sentinel Application Platform implementation. SL2P was found to under-estimate LAI by 20% to 50% over forests with LAI > 2; in agreement with other studies and with comparisons to MODIS and CGLS products. SL2P bias for fCOVER and fAPAR transitions from similar to 0.1 at low values to similar to -0.1 at high values. Precision error, at one standard deviation, was similar to 0.5 for LAI and slightly less than similar to 0.1 for fCOVER and fAPAR. Total uncertainty was dominated by bias for LAI and was slightly greater than precision error for fCOVER and fAPAR. Target user requirements were satisfied for 51% of LAI, 37% of fCOVER and 31% of fAPAR comparisons to in-situ measurements. For all variables, accuracy exhibited weak to moderate linear relationships to clumping (r2 <= 0.52), but scatter plots indicated larger negative LAI biases over northern latitude sites where canopies exhibited greater clumping. With the exception of evergreen broadleaf forests, empirical bias correction using in-situ data reduced accuracy error by 40% for fCOVER, 57% for fAPAR and, 92% for LAI and increased the agreement rate with uncertainty requirements by up to 8%. Users of SL2P LAI over forests are recommended to apply bias correction or consider recalibrating SL2P with spatially heterogenous radiative transfer model simulations.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data displays strong directional anisotropy. This characteristic makes the LST at different angles incomparable and limits its application. Multi-angle data are usually required to model or retrieve the angular anisotropy, but most of the TIR images are observed from one single angle. This study investigates the relationship between fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) and thermal radiance, and proposes a practical method for angular normalization of LST using an FVC-radiance space LST angular normalization (called the FRAN method) to perform LST angular normalization for two-component (leaf and soil) vegetated canopy using only single-angle, single-temporal TIR data. In this method, the single-angle data are used to construct the space and build a linear relationship between FVC and radiance. Nadir radiance and LST are obtained by using FVC data at nadir. The validity and accuracy of the FRAN method are tested by using simulated dataset. Results show that 60%-70% of the angular effect of LST can be corrected, and the maximum LST correction reaches 2.0 K. The LST biased error distribution changes to unbiased distribution after angular normalization. The method sensitivity to the vertex of FVC-radiance space and the parameter in FVC calculation is analyzed. The FRAN method is applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and obtains the maximum correction of LST as 1.2 K. Viewing zenith angle and land cover affect the corrected LST. The FRAN method has the potential for practical angular normalization of LST with single-angle data.

AB Thorough characterization of probabilities of detection (POD) and quantification uncertainties is fundamentally important to understand the place of aerial measurement technologies in alternative means of emission limi-tation (AMEL) or alternate fugitive emissions management programs (Alt-FEMP); monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) efforts; and surveys designed to support measurement-based emissions inventories and mitigation tracking. This paper presents a robust framework for deriving continuous probability of detection functions and quantification uncertainty models for example aerial measurement techniques based on controlled release data. Using extensive fully-and semi-blinded controlled release experiments to test Bridger Photonics Inc.'s Gas Mapping LiDAR (GML)TM, as well as available semi-and non-blinded controlled release data for Kairos LeakSurveyorTM and NASA/JPL AVIRIS-NG technologies, robust POD functions are derived that enable calcu-lation of detection probability for any given source rate, wind speed, and flight altitude. Uncertainty models are separately developed that independently address measurement bias, bias variability, and measurement precision, allowing for a distribution of the true source rate to be directly calculated from the source rate estimated by the technology. Derived results demonstrate the potential of all three technologies in methane detection and miti-gation, and the developed methodology can be readily applied to characterize other techniques or update POD and uncertainty models following future controlled release experiments. Finally, the analyzed results also demonstrate the importance of using controlled release data from a range of sites and times to avoid under-estimating measurement uncertainties.

AB Coherent filaments at the ocean surface often appear to be transient watermass boundaries, where currents converge, surfactants accumulate, and frontal structure at depth can possibly delineate enhanced biological activity in the upper water column. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) permits filaments to be observed at O[1-km] resolution, but extensive coherent structures are more apparent in weaker winds. A wind speed adjustment is proposed for filaments (i.e., contiguous SAR contrasts) of at least 10 km in length. Measures of dependence (distance correlation and the linear and nonlinear components of Pearson correlation) are examined to identify a broad peak in the relationship between filament contrast and weak or moderate values of surface wind speed, where a variable wind speed exponent is employed to maximize these measures. Three locations of recent North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) sightings in the Gulf of St. Lawrence are sampled between 2008 and 2020 by 324 Radarsat-2 SAR scenes and 10-m wind speed from the ERA5 reanalysis. The inverse relationship between SAR contrast magnitude and wind speed is quantified, and a reduced correlation is obtained for all three domains when SAR contrast is weighted by wind speed to the power of 0.8. A more uniform emphasis on ocean surface structure within a SAR scene, or across multiple scenes, can thus be considered in the search for prey aggregations of the North Atlantic right whale.

AB Due to the physiological connection with photosynthesis, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides a promising indicator of vegetation physiological changes caused by environmental stress (e.g. water deficiency). SIF response to crop physiological alterations under water stress is complicated by concurrent non-physiological changes. The non-physiological variation stems from crop structure, leaf optical traits (i.e. pigments, leaf water content, and dry matter), and sun-target geometry. This study aims to disentangle the physiological effect from the non-physiological effect on SIF variations caused by water stress, providing more direct insights into the mechanism of SIF response to stress. We parameterized the radiative transfer model (RTM) SCOPE with top-ofcanopy (TOC) reflectance and SIF measurements to decouple the joint effects on TOC SIF in sugar beet. SIF and reflectance data were acquired over irrigated and water-stressed plots using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) on two consecutive days. The non-physiological response was quantified with SCOPE by fitting the model parameters to the TOC reflectance measurements. Subsequently, fluorescence emission yield (phi F) was estimated using SIF measurements to represent the actual physiological status. The results demonstrate that SIF variation caused by water stress both at 687 nm and 760 nm was affected by both the physiological alterations in phi F and the non-physiological changes. At both 687 nm and 760 nm, the non-physiological contribution to SIF variations was lower than the contribution of phi F variation induced by water stress. The lower non-physiological contribution was mainly due to the weak combined effect of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by leaf chlorophyll (fAPARchl) and the fluorescence escape fraction (fesc) on SIF responses. This study provided direct insights into the plant physiological status under water stress and further indicated the ability of the approach of combining RTMs, canopy reflectance, and SIF measurements to support the scalable quantitative use of SIF from the leaf to the ecosystem level.

AB In tropical forests, leaf phenology signals leaf-on/off status and exhibits considerable variability across scales from a single tree-crown to the entire forest ecosystem. Such phenology signals importantly regulate large-scale biogeochemical cycles and regional climate. PlanetScope CubeSats data with a 3-m resolution and near-daily global coverage provide an unprecedented opportunity to monitor both fine-and ecosystem-scale phenology variability along large environmental gradients. However, a scalable method that accurately characterizes leaf phenology from PlanetScope with biophysically meaningful metrics remains lacking. We developed an index -guided, ecologically constrained autoencoder (IG-ECAE) method to automatically derive a deciduousness metric (percentage of upper tree canopies with leaf-off status within an image pixel) from PlanetScope. The IG-ECAE first estimated the reflectance spectra of leafy/leafless canopies based on their spectral indices charac-teristics, then used the derived reflectance spectra to guide an autoencoder deep learning method with additional ecological constraints to refine the reflectance spectra, and finally used linear spectral unmixing to estimate the relative abundance of leafless canopies (or deciduousness) per PlanetScope image pixel. We tested the IG-ECAE method at 16 tropical forest sites spanning multiple continents and a large precipitation gradient (1470-2819 mm year -1). Among these sites, we evaluated the PlanetScope-derived deciduousness against corresponding measures derived from WorldView-2 (n = 9 sites) and local phenocams (n = 9 sites). Our results show that PlanetScope-derived deciduousness agrees: 1) with that derived from WorldView-2 at the patch level (90 m x 90 m) with r2 = 0.89 across all sites; and 2) with that derived from phenocams to quantify ecosystem-scale sea-sonality with r2 ranging from 0.62 to 0.96. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of IG-ECAE in characterizing the wide variability in deciduousness across scales from pixels to forest ecosystems, and from a single date to the full annual cycle, indicating the potential for using high-resolution satellites to track the large-scale phenological patterns and response of tropical forests to climate change.

AB The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is the highest plateau in the world, which imposes the intense thermal and dynamical forcings on the atmosphere and then impacts the climate in its surroundings. The TP has been undergoing a rapid warming, which accelerates glacial melting, and causes more natural hazards. Although the warming on the TP has been widely investigated, there is no complete picture of its thermal status during the past decades for lack of high-quality, long-term, spatiotemporal-continuous observations. The number of weather stations are rather limited and are mainly located in the east of the TP. The analysis based on these stations is confronted with the spatial representativeness problem. On the other hand, Satellites can monitor the earth seamlessly in space and time, but reliable land surface temperatures (LSTs) have only been available in recent 20 years, and moreover their physical meaning also differs from that of the most commonly used surface air temperatures (SATs). For climate change research, the period length of these satellite LSTs is too short to obtain a definitive conclusion. In this study, the entire algorithm consists of two primary steps. One is to develop an stacking-based ensemble learning algorithm to convert LSTs to SATs with the random forest model as both base learner and meta learner. The other is to construct a Bayesian-based temporal extension algorithm to merge satellite SATs and station SATs to obtain long-term, spatiotemporal-continuous SATs. After validating the reliability of these SATs and the warming trends based on them, 60 years (1961-2020) of SATs on the TP are implemented to examine the warming status of the TP. The spatial pattern of temperature trends illustrates that the warming occurs almost everywhere on the TP, and lots of areas with intensive warming, cannot be detected only based on station ob-servations, especially in the western part of the TP. Similarly, ERA5-Land and CRU datasets underestimate the warming in these areas. The newly-derived warming rate arrives at 0.03 degrees C/year and is 50% greater than those computed based on ERA5-Land and CRU dataset, implying an unexpected severe threat to the cryosphere.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in the processes of energy exchange and water cycle between the land surface and the atmosphere. The impact of cloud cover leads to spatially incomplete of thermal infrared (TIR)-based LST products, which seriously hinders the applications of LST products in various fields. Several methods have been developed to reconstruct LST under cloudy conditions in previous studies, but there is a lack of an effective method for the reconstruction of cloudy LST at the spatial resolution of Landsat pixel (30 m). In this study, a novel method was proposed to reconstruct LST under cloudy conditions from Landsat 8 data. The LST reconstruction method includes four main steps: (1) identification of cloud-free, cloud-shadow, cloudobscured, and cloud-covered pixels by integrating the Fmask method with a cloud-shape matching method; (2) calculation of annual temperature cycle (ATC)-based reference LST by fitting an ATC model to all available Landsat 8 LST product during 2013-2020; (3) estimation of LST residual from spatially adjacent similar pixels; and (4) estimation of reconstructed LST in terms of the sum of ATC-based reference LST and LST residual. The performance of the LST reconstruction method was evaluated using Landsat 8 LST images under clear-sky conditions as reference data. The root mean squared error (RMSE) between reconstructed LST and Landsat 8 reference LST ranges from 0.9 K to 2.5 K. The LST reconstruction method was further applied to reconstruct actual Landsat 8 LST images under cloudy conditions. Compared with original Landsat 8 LST images, the spatial distribution of reconstructed LST images is more complete. The pattern of reconstructed LST images reflects the spatial variability of LST well. The accuracy of the LST reconstruction method was validated against in situ LST measurements at six SURFRAD (Surface Radiation Budget Network) sites. The overall bias and RMSE between reconstructed LST and in situ LST at all sites are approximately -0.3 K and 3.5 K, respectively. The LST reconstruction method has great potentials to improve the applications of Landsat LST product in urban thermal environment monitoring and crop water stress monitoring.

AB Monitoring nighttime light (NTL) change enables us to quantitatively analyze the dynamic patterns of human activity and socioeconomic features. NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) atmospheric-and Lunar-BRDF-corrected Black Marble product (VNP46A2) provides daily global night-time radiances with high temporal consistency. However, timely and continuous monitoring of NTL changes based on the dense daily DNB time series is still lacking. In this study, we proposed a novel Viewing Zenith Angle (VZA) stratified COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD) algorithm (VZA-COLD) to detect NTL change at 15 arc-second spatial resolution with daily updating capability based on NASA's Black Marble prod-ucts. Specifically, we divided the clear observations into four VZA intervals (0-20 degrees, 20 degrees-40 degrees, 40 degrees-60 degrees, and 0-60 degrees) to mitigate the temporal variation of the NTL data caused by the combined angular effects of viewing geometry and the complex surface conditions (e.g., building heights, vegetation canopy covers, etc.). Single-term harmonic models were continuously estimated for new observations from each VZA interval, and by comparing the model predictions with the actual DNB observations, a unified set of NTL changes can be captured continuously among the different VZA intervals. The final NTL change maps were generated after excluding the consistent dark pixels. Results showed that the VZA-COLD algorithm reduced the DNB data temporal variations caused by disparities among different viewing angles and surface conditions, and successfully detected NTL changes for six globally distributed test sites with an overall accuracy of 99.71%, a user's accuracy of 87.18%, and a producer's accuracy of 68.88% for the NTL change category.

AB Satellite microwave observations from 1.4 to 36 GHz already showed sensitivity to several geophysical parameters of sea ice such as Sea Ice Concentration (SIC), Sea Ice Thickness (SIT) or snow depth. The main goal of this article is to provide a realistic and comprehensive characterization of the sea ice and its snow cover that explains the microwave observations during a whole year using a radiative transfer model. For this purpose, we construct a unique dataset of passive microwave observations, to mimic the future Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR), along with the active microwave scatterometer data (ASCAT). CIMR database is used to classify sea ice microwave signatures in their spectral dimension with a machine learning technique while ASCAT data are used to help interpret the results of the classification. Classification results are then interpreted with a state-of-art sea ice and Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer model (SMRT) for all highlighted signatures and all seasons. Results make it possible to identify the specific behaviors from the observation co-variabilities for SIC, SIT, and snow structure. Our analysis underlined the role of the depth hoar over multi-year ice, for the interpretation of scattering signals in winter. Scattering signals that appear in late summer are explained by the presence of superimposed ice. This characterization will benefit from future advances in SMRT development, as well as the improved observations of future satellite missions.

AB The accurate spatial information of snow cover is useful for understanding the impact of global warming, and it is of high significance for hydrological disaster prediction, water resources management, and climate change research. The Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) based approach has been used extensively around the world for mapping snow, and they displayed high accuracy in open areas. However, capturing snow cover in forests remains problematic due to the obstruction effects of the forest canopy, which causes the snow cover area to be seriously underestimated. In this paper, we present a new algorithm based on machine learning (ML) technology to improve the accuracy of binary snow cover (BSC) mapping in forests, using the remotely sensed surface reflectance and ground truth data. A time-lapse photography network with a two-hour resolution was established in the eastern Qilian Mountains in northwestern China to obtain the ground truth data both in forests and open areas. We trained Random Forests (RF) with the 500-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data from bands 1-7 to generate BSC results (RF-BSC). Then we evaluated RF-BSC and the NDSI-derived BSC maps with three different NDSI thresholds (i.e., 0.10, 0.29, and 0.40) against ground truth data. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a high performance in forest BSC mapping in this area, compared to the NDSI-threshold approach. The RF-BSC can retrieve 67% of all real forest snow pixels, while the NDSI-based BSC can only detect 8-14%. We also find that the performance of the algorithm seems to be sensitive to changes in solar illumination conditions and forest coverage. This study suggests that machine learning with the fusion of optical remote sensing and ground-based observations is an effective approach for improving the accuracy of forest snow cover mapping at regional scales.

AB Haze contamination is a very common issue in remote sensing images, which inevitably limits data usability and further applications. Several methods have been developed for haze removal, which is an ill-posed problem. However, most of these methods involve various strong assumptions coupled with manually-determined parameters, which limit their generalization to different scenarios. Moreover, temporal information amongst time series images has rarely been considered in haze removal. In this paper, the temporal information is proposed to be incorporated for more reliable haze removal, and guided by this general idea, a temporal information injection network (TIIN) is developed. The proposed TIIN solution for haze removal extracts the useful information in the temporally neighboring images provided by the regular revisit of satellite sensors. The TIIN method is suitable for images with various haze levels. Moreover, TIIN is also applicable for temporal neighbors with inherent haze or land cover changes due to a long-time interval between images. The proposed method was validated through experiments on both simulated and real haze images as well as comparison with five state-ofthe-art benchmark methods. This research provides a new paradigm for enhancing haze removal by incorporating temporally neighboring images.

AB The tasseled cap transformation (TCT) has been widely used to decompose satellite multi-spectral information into "brightness", "greenness", and "wetness" components. Published TCT coefficients for the Landsat sensor series have mainly been derived using top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and sparse data sets. Studies to derive TCT coefficients for Landsat surface reflectance (SR) are lacking. In this study, the TCT coefficients were derived independently for Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) SR and TOA reflectance using the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization (GSO) method. To ensure that the derived TCT coefficients are robust and broadly applicable, representative samples of soil, vegetation, and water were selected from summer and autumn Landsat-8 OLI Analysis Ready Data (ARD) sampled from 40.4 million 30 m pixel locations across the conterminous United States (CONUS). Given that the blue band is susceptible to atmospheric contamination due to its shorter wavelength, two groups of TCT coefficients were derived: one from 6 bands (Blue, Green, Red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2) and one from 5 bands without the blue band. As TCT results cannot be validated in a formal way, the TCT components for CONUS summer TOA and SR composites were generated and compared with National Land Cover Database (NLCD) land cover classes to provide a synoptic assessment and provide confidence in the results. In addition, three ARD tiles selected to encompass a mix of land cover types, predominantly, desert in Nevada, wetland and urban in Florida, and agriculture in North Dakota, were used to analyze the seasonal variation of the TCT components. The results demonstrate that the derived Landsat-8 TCT coefficients can effectively characterize brightness, greenness, and wetness components across the CONUS, and show good consistency for discrimination of land cover types and track seasonal surface variations. There was no significant difference between each TCT component derived using the 6-band and 5-band TCT coefficients considering a large sample of CONUS pixels. Therefore, the 5-band TCT coefficients provided in this study are recommended for use, as the blue band is atmospherically sensitive and difficult to atmospherically correct reliably.

AB Remote-sensing methods based on optical and thermal satellite imagery have been proposed to estimate fine-resolution (30 m) rootzone soil moisture (theta) over bar. In these methods (theta) over bar. is most commonly estimated using a single empirical relationship with evaporative fraction Lambda(SEB) or evaporative index Lambda(PET). Methods have been proposed recently to estimate these relationships based on regional climate, soil, and vegetation characteristics, but those methods have not yet been applied to estimate (theta) over bar from remote sensing data. The objective of this study is to evaluate the. estimates from remote sensing when the Lambda(SEB) vs. (theta) over bar and Lambda(PET) vs. (theta) over bar relationships are inferred from regional characteristics using the previously proposed methods. Four study regions are considered including the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Arizona, the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site and Lower Arkansas River Valley in Colorado, the Little Washita and Fort Cobb Experimental Watersheds in Oklahoma, and the Mississippi Delta region in Mississippi. The (theta) over bar estimates from the regionally adapted relationships are compared to (theta) over bar estimates from the single empirical relationship and to in situ (theta) over bar measurements. The estimates from the regionally adapted relationships consistently outperform the estimates form the single empirical relationship. The performance typically improves as more regional information is used in the relationships and reduces the root mean squared error of (theta) over bar by an average of 45% among the four regions. The regional method typically performs better for the arid and semiarid regions with root mean squared errors of 0.05 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively. The regionally adapted relationships better capture both spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture than the single empirical relationship.

AB Species composition is a key determinant of grassland ecosystem function and resilience. Climate change is predicted to alter the distribution of cool season (C-3) and warm season (C-4) grasses, however, the lack of spatial distributions and temporal variations of grass functional type information severely limits our understanding of climate impacts on grasslands. This study classified C-3 and C-4 grasses per pixel according to the peak of growing season generated from Enhanced Vegetation Index time series. From 2003 to 2017, the C-3-C-4 composition of Australian rain-fed grasslands and pastures was mapped at 500 m resolution on an annual basis across a wide geographical range (10 degrees S - 45 degrees S), and revealed extreme inter-annual fluctuations. Over the 15-year period, the satellite-derived ratio of C-4 to C-3 grasses significantly increased (p < 0.05), indicating a long-term shift in community composition that was confirmed with 182,911 Atlas of Living Australia ground observations. The most pronounced changes occurred in mid-latitude transitional areas where C-3 and C-4 grasses co-dominate. Our climate analysis indicated the inter-annual fluctuations of C-4/C-3 grass ratios were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with warm/cool season rainfall ratios, and not with temperature or annual rainfall. This suggests that an increase in the warm/cool season rainfall ratio favors C-4 grasses and a decrease in the warm/cool season rainfall ratio favors C-3 grasses. Our findings reveal spatially-detailed dynamics of grasslands and demonstrate large-scale grassland compositional changes over 15 years. The grass composition maps should help improve ecological forecasting of grass distributions and enable researches on grassland ecosystem responses to climate change that are relevant to both adaptation of rangeland agricultural and fire management practices. Our study should also help predict grass distribution under future climate conditions, and assist in the accurate modelling of global water, carbon, and energy exchanges between the land surface and atmosphere.

AB Rapid shrub expansion has been observed across the Arctic, driving a need for regional-scale estimates of shrub biomass and shrub-mediated ecosystem processes such as rainfall interception. Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data have been shown sensitive to vegetation canopy characteristics across many ecosystems, thereby potentially providing an accurate and cost-effective tool to quantify shrub canopy cover. This study evaluated the sensitivity of L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) data to the aboveground biomass and Leaf Area Index (LAI) of dwarf birch and alder in the Trail Valley Creek watershed, Northwest Territories, Canada. The sigma degrees VH /sigma degrees VV ratio showed strong sensitivity to both LAI (R2 = 0.72 with respect to in-situ measurements) and wet aboveground biomass (R2 = 0.63) of dwarf birch. Our ALOS-2-derived maps revealed high variability of birch shrub LAI and biomass across spatial scales. The LAI map was fed into the sparse Gash model to estimate shrub rainfall interception, an important but under-studied component of the Arctic water balance. Results suggest that on average across the watershed, 17 +/- 3% of incoming rainfall was intercepted by dwarf birch (during summer 2018), highlighting the importance of shrub rainfall interception for the regional water balance. These findings demonstrate the unexploited potential of L-band SAR observations from satellites for quantifying the impact of shrub expansion on Arctic ecosystem processes.

AB The intensity of land use and management in permanent grasslands affects both biodiversity and important ecosystem services. Comprehensive knowledge about these intensities is a crucial factor for sustainable decisionmaking in landscape policy. For meadows, the management intensity can be described by proxies such as the mowing frequency, usually, a higher number of cuts indicate higher intensities. Dense time series of medium resolution (10-30 m) remote sensing data are suitable for the detection of mowing events. However, existing studies revealed a general lack of consensus about the most appropriate input data set for a consistent and reliable mowing detection. We systematically evaluated the synergistic use of acquisitions from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 to detect the occurrence, frequency, and date of mowing events as an indicator of grassland management intensity. Dense time series of NDVI (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8), gamma 0 backscatter, backscatter cross-ratio, backscatter secondorder texture metrics as well as 6-day interferometric coherence (Sentinel-1) were used as input features. All possible combinations of input features were tested to train a one-dimensional convolutional neural network, which enables enhanced exploitation of the temporal domain of the data. The evaluation was conducted on 64 meadows for an overall of 257 mowing events from 2017 to 2019 in Germany. Our results revealed that the combination of input features improves the detection performance. The highest overall accuracy was reached by a combination of NDVI, backscatter cross-ratio, and interferometric coherence with an F1-Score of 0.84. The mowing frequency was predicted with a mean absolute error of 0.38 events per year, while the date of the events was missed by 3.79 days on average. NDVI time series alone mostly underperformed in comparison to optical/SAR combinations but clearly outperformed input-sets that were solely based on SAR features. The proposed model performed well for meadows with low to medium management intensities but further testing is recommended for highly intensive managed parcels. The results clearly demonstrate the additional value of fusing time series of the three present Earth observation systems that deliver a freely available global coverage of the land surface at medium resolution.

AB Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been linked to a substantial disease burden globally, yet little has been done to estimate the population health risks of PM2.5 in South Africa due to the lack of high-resolution PM2.5 exposure estimates. We developed a random forest model to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations at 1 km(2) resolution in and around industrialized Gauteng Province, South Africa, by combining satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorology, land use, and socioeconomic data. We then compared PM2.5 concentrations in the study domain before and after the implementation of the new national air quality standards. We aimed to test whether machine learning models are suitable for regions with sparse ground observations such as South Africa and which predictors played important roles in PM2.5 modeling. The cross-validation R-2 and Root Mean Square Error of our model was 0.80 and 9.40 mu g/m(3), respectively. Satellite AOD, seasonal indicator, total precipitation, and population were among the most important predictors. Model-estimated PM2.5 levels successfully captured the temporal pattern recorded by ground observations. Spatially, the highest annual PM2.5 concentration appeared in central and northern Gauteng, including northern Johannesburg and the city of Tshwane. Since the 2016 changes in national PM2.5 standards, PM2.5 concentrations have decreased in most of our study region, although levels in Johannesburg and its surrounding areas have remained relatively constant. This is anadvanced PM2.5 model for South Africa with high prediction accuracy at the daily level and at a relatively high spatial resolution. Our study provided a reference for predictor selection, and our results can be used for a variety of purposes, including epidemiological research, burden of disease assessments, and policy evaluation.

TI Impact of vegetation water content information on soil moisture

   SMAPVEX16-MicroWEX dataset

AB Soil moisture (SM) retrieval in agricultural regions during the growing seasons is particularly challenging due to high spatial variability and dynamic vegetation conditions. The retrievals have been problematic even when the passive signatures at different spatial scales match well since they depend upon the accuracy of vegetation information such as the vegetation water content (VWC). The VWC used in the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) single channel retrieval algorithm (SCA) is derived from remotely sensed, climatologically-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which does not respond to real-time vegetation dynamics and is prone to saturation. This study explored the differences and seasonal trend in passive signatures and SM at satellite- and field-scales and investigated uncertainties in retrievals arising from different approaches used to estimate VWC from optical and radar indices. It used high temporal resolution, ground-based data collected during the SMAP Validation-Microwave Water, Energy Balance Experiment in 2016 (SMAPVEX16-MicroWEX) during a growing season of corn and soybean. Overall, the brightness temperatures (TB) from SMAP matched well with the upscaled, ground-based TB, with a root mean square differences (RMSDs) of about 5 K. In contrast, the SMAP SM retrievals were worse during rapid vegetation growth in the mid-season, with higher RMSDs compared to the upscaled in situ SM, than those in the late-season. In addition, the ground-based TB from corn and soybean were similar in the early and the late seasons, while their emission differences were > 40 K in the mid season. This indicates the importance of accurate VWC information, particularly during the early and late growing seasons, to account for sub-pixel heterogeneities in agricultural regions. VWC obtained from five optical and radar indices were used in the SMAP SCA for soil moisture retrieval for the entire growing season of corn. The NDVI-based VWC provided SM retrievals that were consistently lower compared to those using in situ VWC, with a higher RMSD of 0.030 m3/m3 and a negative bias of 0.020 m3/m3 for VWC > 4 kg/m2. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)-derived VWC resulted in lower SM retrieval RMSD of 0.022 m3/m3 when compared with in situ SM. Among the three radar indices, vertically polarized cross-pol ratio (CRvv)-derived VWC provided similar RMSDs in retrieved SM as the NDWI-derived VWC during the growing season. The radar vegetation index (RVI)derived VWC improved in the late season compared to the in situ VWC and resulted in SM retrievals with RMSDs similar to the CRvv-derived retrievals. Results presented here suggest that SMAP SCA SM retrievals could be improved through the use of near-real time NDWI and CRvv-derived vegetation information. Microwave data are available regardless of cloud cover, so the guaranteed availability of CRvv to capture seasonal and interannual variability is advantageous.

AB In this study, an automatic change detection method for near real-time (NRT) forest monitoring in tropical re-gions is described. L-band ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 ScanSAR HH, HV, and HH/HV ratio were used to detect various deforestation stages based on their different radar scattering characteristics. The three main stages considered in this approach were as follows: (1) forest was cut, and felled trees were left on the ground, (2) felled trees were burned, and (3) felled (and burned) trees were removed. Two types of forest fires occurred in tropical rain forests and dry and open forests were considered. Multi-temporal data and image normalization techniques are used to suppress commission errors induced by the effects of seasonality and rainfall. Detection accuracies were eval-uated at 11 validation sites distributed over various forest types in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. The user's and producer's accuracies of the proposed forest monitoring algorithm were estimated to be 85.0% and 63.8%, respectively. An additional broader performance assessment using data from 191 sites showed an esti-mated total user's accuracy of 71.1%. The results indicate that detection accuracies depend on temporal se-quences, with slower, gradual transitions from forest to other land cover hampering detection performance. The developed algorithm is used in the JICA-JAXA Forest Early Warning System in the tropics (JJ-FAST), which provides forest change information for 77 countries every 42 days under all weather conditions. The NRT alert products are freely available from the JJ-FAST website 3-4 days after PALSAR-2 observation.

AB Can satellite data be used to address challenges currently faced by the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) sector? What benefit can satellite observations bring to resource assessment and maintenance of ORE farms? Can satellite observations be used to assess the environmental impact of offshore renewables leading towards a more sustainable ORE sector? This review paper faces these questions presenting a holistic view of the current interactions between satellite and ORE sectors, and future needs to make this partnership grow. The aim of the work is to start the conversation between these sectors by establishing a common ground. We present offshore needs and satellite technology limitations, as well as potential opportunities and areas of growth. To better understand this, the reader is guided through the history, current developments, challenges and future of offshore wind, tidal and wave energy technologies. Then, an overview on satellite observations for ocean applications is given, covering types of instruments and how they are used to provide different metocean variables, satellite performance, and data processing and integration. Past, present and future satellite missions are also discussed. Finally, the paper focuses on innovation opportunities and the potential of synergies between the ORE and satellite sectors. Specifically, we pay attention to improvements that satellite observations could bring to standard measurement techniques: assessing uncertainty, wind, tidal and wave conditions forecast, as well as environmental monitoring from space. Satellite-enabled measurement of ocean physical processes and applications for fisheries, mammals and birds, and habitat change, are also discussed in depth.

AB Traditional Neural Networks (NN) have been popular in the satellite remote sensing community for the last 25 years. For coarse resolution infrared or microwave instruments, NN algorithms have been used at the pixel level. New neural architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) use the Deep Learning (DL) approach to solve complex problems at the image scale. For instance, CNNs have been applied to high resolution instruments (SAR or in the visible domain) to detect surface waters or vegetation. High resolution data is better suited for image processing techniques because spatial features are stronger and pixel noise can be an important issue. CNNs applications are generally related to image classification or segmentation, less for regression problems dealing with the estimation of a variable in each pixel of the image. The objective of this paper is to better understand how and on which conditions CNNs work, and how beneficial they can be for coarse resolution instruments such as IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer). The CNN and DL approaches are tested in a regression mode, to estimate the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) at the image scale. The CNN technique is compared to a traditional pixel-based NN: both have a SST retrieval error of 0.3 K. An instrument noise and a missing data sensitivity studies are conducted. It is shown that the use of the CNN approach in this simpleexperiment context is beneficial only under some conditions: when the variable to retrieve has enough spatial coherency (simple smoothness or presence of spatial features in the images), and when the instrument noise at the pixel scale is larger than a threshold. This study is a preliminary illustration of what can be expected from CNNs for coarse resolution instruments such as IASI.

AB Vegetation optical depth (VOD) retrieved from microwave observations has been found to be useful to monitor the dynamics of the vegetation features at global scale. Particularly, many applications could be developed in several fields of research (ecology, water and carbon cycle, etc.) from VOD products retrieved from the SMOS and SMAP observations at L-band, and from the combined AMSR-E (2002-2011)/AMSR2 (2012-present) observations at C-and X-bands. One of the main difficulties in retrieving VOD is that the microwave observations are sensitive to both the soil (mainly soil moisture) and vegetation (mostly VOD) features. The AMSR-E/2 sensors provide only mono-angular observations at two polarizations. These dual-channel observations may be strongly correlated so that retrieving SM and VOD simultaneously can be an ill-posed problem. Here, to overcome this problem, we proposed and evaluated a new retrieval approach from AMSR2 observations at X-band to produce a new X-VOD product. The X-VOD retrievals were based on the inversion of the X-MEB model, an extension of the L-MEB model (L-band microwave emission of the biosphere) to the X-band. The main originality in comparison to previous algorithms is that (i) only VOD was retrieved while SM was estimated from a reanalysis data set (ERA5-Land); (ii) model inversion was based on an innovative approach to initialize the cost function; and (iii) new values for the soil and vegetation X-MEB model parameters were calibrated. To evaluate the methodology, we performed the VOD retrievals over the whole African continent over 2014-2016, including a dry (2015) and a wet (2014) year. In a first step, we calibrated a set of three parameters: effective scattering albedo (omega), soil roughness (H-R) and VOD first guess (VODini). Several datasets of vegetation indices as Above-Ground Biomass (AGB), Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were chosen as reference data to optimize these model parameters. Globally-constant values (omega = 0.06 and H-R = 0.6) were found to achieve high spatial and temporal correlations between retrieved X-VOD and the reference vegetation parameters. Comparison with other X-VOD products suggested IB X-VOD had competitive advantages in terms of both spatial and temporal performances. In particular, spatial correlation with three biomass datasets was found to be higher than for previous X-VOD products (R-2 similar to 0.76-0.83) and temporal correlation with LAI or NDVI showed obvious improvements, especially in dense vegetation.

AB The terrestrial component of the Earth system has witnessed considerable changes in the past decades due to anthropogenic action. Throughout this period, the NASA Terra mission has been constantly monitoring the surface with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. When combined with the MODIS instrument on-board of the Aqua platform, we obtain a hyper-frequent revisit capability providing subdaily observations globally at a moderate resolution of similar to 250 m, but with a strong multi-angular variation of the observation footprint. Here we propose to exploit this particular configuration provided by the combined Terra + Aqua constellation to infer spatial homogeneity from the temporal stability of the observation time series. We thus designed a Temporal Coherence Index (TCI) based on the concept of information entropy. We test it on both synthetic and real landscapes showing its capacity to isolate which time series correspond to homogeneous targets based only on the MODIS measurements themselves. The index is calculated annually for the entirety of emerged surfaces for the period 2003-2020 by leveraging on the scaling capacity of the cloud computing Google Earth Engine (GEE). We foresee multiple practical applications for this index as a novel information layer that should foster the integration of surface data with satellite records, a practice that is increasingly necessary in Earth System Science.

AB Satellite remote sensing can detect and predict subsurface temperature and salinity structure within the ocean over large scales. In the era of big ocean data, making full use of multisource satellite observations to accurately detect and predict global subsurface thermohaline structure and advance our understanding of the ocean interior processes is extremely challenging. This study proposed a new deep learning-based method-bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural networks-for predicting global ocean subsurface temperature and salinity anomalies in combination with surface remote sensing observations (sea-surface temperature anomaly, sea-surface height anomaly, sea-surface salinity anomaly, and the northward and eastward components of seasurface wind anomaly), longitude and latitude information (LON and LAT), and subsurface Argo gridded data. Because of the temporal dependency and periodicity of ocean dynamic parameters, the Bi-LSTM is good at time-series feature learning by considering the significant temporal feature of the ocean variability and can well improve the robustness and generalization ability of the prediction model. For December 2015 as an example, our average prediction results in an overall determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.691/0.392 and a normalized root mean square error of 0.039 degrees C/0.051 PSU for subsurface temperature anomaly (STA)/subsurface salinity anomaly (SSA) prediction. This study sets up different cases based on different sea-surface feature combinations to predict the subsurface thermohaline structure and analyze the role of longitude and latitude information on Bi-LSTM prediction. The results show that in the prediction of STA, the contribution of LON + LAT to the model gradually increases with depth, whereas in the prediction of SSA, LON + LAT maintains a relatively significant contribution to the model at different depths. Meanwhile, in the STA and SSA prediction, the LAT plays a more significant role than LON. We also applied the model to bi-directional prediction for different months of 2010 and 2015 to prove the applicability and robustness of the model. This study suggests that Bi-LSTM is more advantageous in time-series modeling for predicting subsurface and deep ocean temperature and salinity structures, fully takes into account the timing dependence of global ocean data, and outperforms the classic random forest approach in predicting subsurface thermohaline structure from remote sensing data.

TI Spatiotemporal assessment of land use/land cover change and associated
   carbon emissions and uptake in the Mekong River Basin
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Carbon emission; Southeast Asia; MODIS; CCDC; Time series; Mekong
AB Land use and land cover (LULC) change caused by human activities is a major source of anthropogenic carbon emissions and a driver of climate change. The Mekong Region is highly dynamic, experiencing extensive LULC change in recent decades. This study provides a spatially and temporally continuous estimate of LULC change for the Mekong River Basin for 2001-2019 using time series analysis of MODIS data coupled with a spatiotemporal carbon bookkeeping model to track carbon losses and recovery. The LULC change product has an overall accuracy of 74.4 +/- 1.9% (82.1 +/- 1.7% after consolidating tree-dominated classes), including an increase of 5.6% after combining with existing MODIS products (referred to as the M-CCDC process). Two of the largest components of LULC change in the region are the establishment of plantations and agricultural expansion, which were estimated to be 33,617 +/- 7342 km(2) and 14,915 +/- 4682 km(2) between 2003 and 2014. We found that 82% of the deforested area was converted to tree plantations. Among all the newly added plantations, 86% replaced natural forests and 12% replaced agricultural land. In addition, existing maps of annual tree canopy cover (TCC) were used to assess forest disturbances that do not result in LULC conversions. The M-CCDC results combined with the forest disturbances derived from TCC maps were coupled to a spatiotemporal carbon bookkeeping model to estimate carbon emissions and uptake. Carbon emissions were 72.9 +/- 6.2 Tg C yr(-1) during 2001-2017; emissions increase to 102.8 +/- 8.6 Tg C yr(-1) if including carbon not yet released to the atmosphere in the form of decomposing slash and wood products. Carbon uptake for the same period was-35.5 +/- 4.9 Tg C yr(-1), with carbon uptake from new plantations offsetting almost half of the emissions from deforestation in this area. Assessment of post-deforestation land use is crucial for quantifying the short-and longer-term carbon consequences of LULC change.

ID RADIATIVE-TRANSFER; REFLECTANCE
AB DART model is one of the most comprehensive and accurate radiative transfer (RT) models to simulate remotely sensed signals in the Earth-atmosphere system. Its standard RT modelling mode, called DART-FT, relies on the discrete ordinates method. Its recently developed Monte Carlo mode using an unbiased bidirectional path tracing method, called DART-Lux, increases hundredfold DART efficiency to simulate images. Since DART-Lux does not simulate yet atmospheric RT, a hybrid method has been designed to accurately and fast simulate remote sensing images at top of atmosphere (TOA). It couples the atmospheric RT modelling of DART-FT with the very efficient Earth surface RT modelling of DART-Lux. For that, a new sky light modelling, an innovative BRF camera modelling and an adapted radiative coupling framework have been designed. The efficiency and accuracy of this hybrid method have been validated using DART-FT as a reference. Here, we present this validation for a realistic forest stand. Simulation time is reduced by a factor of 750 with a relative difference of solar plane reflectance factor smaller than 1%. This hybrid method opens new perspectives for the use of 3D modelling in remote sensing applications. It is already part of the DART version freely available for scientists (https://dart.omp.eu).

TI Inferring sandstone grain size using spectral datasets: An example from

DE Siliciclastic; Sandstone grain size; Hyperspectral; Petrography;
   Paleoproterozoic Bresnahan group
AB Remotely sensed hyperspectral datasets were integrated with petrographic data to map the distribution of sedimentary rocks in order to infer grain size variations within the siliciclastic, Paleoproterozoic Bresnahan Group in Western Australia. Finer sandstones have greater compositional variation compared to coarser sandstones, with higher modal proportions of mudstone intraclasts, K-feldspar, and muscovite laths, and lower modal quartz. Partial Least Squares modelling indicates a link between visible to shortwave infrared spectral data collected on samples and their average grain size. Specific electronic absorptions are important for defining this relationship, particularly in the blue-green visible spectra, wavelengths related to water or hydroxyl bonds, along with certain wavelengths in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectra. The results from field samples were compared to airborne hyperspectral datasets which showed broad scale regional variations in composition could be discerned from processed white mica abundance maps and images that use spectral bands 2350 nm and 2200 nm. The remotely sensed compositional variations are relatable to changes in sandstone grain size. Diagenetic alteration and surface weathering may influence the absorption spectra, although the effect of the latter can be reduced by using processed white mica abundance maps. Overall, the results show that airborne hyperspectral datasets, particularly the SWIR part of the spectra, can be useful to remotely map spatial compositional variations associated with sandstone grain size. This shows the method can be used to remotely map siliciclastic successions in other sedimentary basins by aiding recognition of grain size trends and significant stratal surfaces associated with changes in composition. However, the important wavelengths may differ due to other controls on sandstone composition such as uplift history of the source region, changes in sediment dispersal, and transport mechanisms.

AB Rainfall is a key driver of terrestrial vegetation. Clarifying the response mechanism of vegetation to rainfall can advance the understanding of expected changes in ecosystems under projected rainfall scenarios. Besides the rainfall amount over a period of time, the frequency, duration and intensity are of importance in driving ecosystem processes. The pulsating nature of rainfall forcing and of vegetation response applies particularly to arid and semi - arid regions and led to conceptualize the "pulse-reserve" paradigm, which we used to explain the approach we propose in this study. We introduce the Transfer Function Analysis (TFA) method in the frequency domain to capture the response of vegetation to rainfall at multiple temporal scales. The TFA method determines coherence, gain, and phase to characterize the existence, strength, and time-lag, respectively, of the vegetation response to rainfall at different temporal scales. Specifically, the coherence measures the existence of the response and only with a significant response are the gain and phase values significant and valuable for further analysis. The gain measures the strength of the relationship between fluctuations in vegetation growth and fluctuations in rainfall, while the phase value (i.e. the time-lag) measures how fluctuations in vegetation growth lag (or lead) fluctuations in rainfall. The TFA method was applied to the 34-years (1982-2015) NDVI3g and CHIRPS precipitation dataset in the Sahel-Sudano-Guinean region (20 degrees W similar to 60 degrees E, 0-25 degrees E). The Sahelian zone was characterized by a significant vegetation response to rainfall across all interand intraannual time-scales, while the Sudano-Guinean zone was dominated by significant response at annual or 6-month scales. The negative phase lag indicated that rainfall variation normally led NDVI change for most areas and across timescales. However, a positive phase observed in part of the tropical rainforest area indicated that NDVI changes led rainfall variations, which may be caused by the strong vegetation-rainfall feedback through recycling of precipitation by evapotranspiration. In summary, these results suggested that the TFA method is a powerful tool to quantify the vegetation-rainfall response regime across a range of timescales, as conceptualized by the "pulse reserve" paradigm. Unraveling the response of fluctuations in vegetation growth to separate components of the forcing by precipitation might improve our understanding of environmental change in the past decades in the Sahel - Sudan - Guinean region.

AB Terrain elevation is essential for land management, navigation, and earth science applications. Remote sensing advancements have led to an increase in the availability of a range of digital elevation models with global to quasi-global land coverage. However, the generation of these models in water bodies requires specialized approaches, such as the delimitation of the shorelines (isobaths) of lakes over time. Therefore, the processing costs are high in complex areas with many lakes. Currently, there is no systematic topographic mapping of lakes and channels in large and complex floodplains using remote sensing data. We present here the first high-resolution topographic mapping (30 m) of the non-forested portion of the middle-lower Amazon floodplain using a new method based on in-situ Amazon river water levels and a flood-frequency map derived from the Landsat Global Surface Water Dataset. Validation using locally derived bathymetry showed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.89 m for floodplain elevation and a good representation of spatial patterns with Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.77. Our approach for improving topographic representation in open water areas is an alternative to SRTM3 DEM or MERIT DEM, which represents these areas as a flat surface. We also generated the Amazon River bathymetry using nautical charts from the Brazilian Navy (average RMSE of 7.5 m and bias of 5 m), and floodplain depths maps corresponding to the highand low-water periods of the river flood wave. The results show that the storage volume in the open-water floodplain varies 104.3 km3 on average each year (from 11.9 km3 in low-water to 116.2 km3 in high-water). The method can be applied to any temporarily flooded area to provide the often missing underwater digital topographic data required for hydrological, ecological, and geomorphological studies.

AB Characterizing preand post-fire fuels remains a key challenge for estimating biomass consumption and carbon emissions from wildfires. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data have demonstrated effectiveness for estimating canopy, and to a lesser degree, surface fuel components at fine-scale (i.e., 30 m) across landscapes. Using pre -and post-fire ALS data and corresponding field data, this study estimated consumption of canopy fuel (Delta CF), understory fuel (Delta UF), total fuel (Delta TF), and canopy bulk density (Delta CBD) for the 2012 Pole Creek fire in Oregon, USA (10,760 ha), and portions of the 2011 Las Conchas fire in New Mexico, USA (4,934 ha). Additionally, the feasibility of predicting fuel consumption was tested using separate preand post-fire models (PrePost), models combining all preand post-fire data (Pooled), and models using all data from both fires (Global). Estimates of Delta TF were then compared to fire radiative energy (FRE, units: MJ) derived from Fire Radiative Power (FRP, units: MW) observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard NASA Terra and Aqua satellites to mechanistically derive a biomass combustion coefficient (BCC, units: kg MJ(-1)). The PrePost and Pooled approaches yielded similar results at Las Conchas, but at Pole Creek insufficient pre-fire field data resulted in erroneous fuel consumption estimates outside the fire perimeter using the PrePost models. These results demonstrated that pre-fire field data were less important for these models than having field data which represent the full range of fuel conditions likely to exist across the landscape. Estimated total biomass consumed for the PrePost, Pooled, and Global models were 226 Gg, 224 Gg, and 224 Gg at Las Conchas, and 581 Gg, 713 Gg, and 552 Gg at Pole Creek. Comparisons between estimated Delta TF and FRE yielded an average BCC for both fires of 0.367 (s.d. +/- 0.049) kg MJ(-1) based on pixels with at least five MODIS observations. Both higher MODIS observations per pixel and accounting for canopy occlusion of FRE improved the relationship between Delta TF and MODIS-FRE. This study suggested a practical modelling approach for future efforts using only post-fire field observations and quantified a landscape-scale relationship between MODIS-derived FRE and fine-scale fuel consumption consistent with prior experiments.

AB Passive microwave datasets have been used to quantify the extent and duration of surface melt in Greenland and Antarctica from 1978 on with daily and near-daily intervals. These results have important implications for climate analysis and may help evaluate ice shelf stability. However, the accuracy of passive microwave methods used to detect melt is difficult to quantify, especially on the Antarctic Peninsula. Here four different melt de-tection methods are employed, including a new formulation of a statistical analysis of brightness temperature time series using a K-means clustering algorithm. Strikingly, two of the most widely used passive microwave melt detection methods are found to vary by 48% mean days of melt per year across six different locations on the Larsen C, Wilkins, and George VI Ice Shelves. In the absence of ground truth observations, time series of Sentinel 1 SAR observations from 2016 on provide a comparison dataset. In topographically flat regions where surface melt is spatially uniform, the passive microwave melt detection method based on a K-means analysis and the cross-polarization gradient ratio method demonstrate the highest agreement and correlation with active radar melt detection methods. One issue which has plagued passive microwave analysis is its coarse spatial resolution. High resolution SAR images are able to demonstrate and quantify the spatial variability of melt within individual passive microwave pixels. Melt is shown to be suitably uniform in space for passive microwave applications at the study sites on Antarctic Peninsula ice shelves, but not so in other regions of the Antarctic Peninsula. Spatial heterogeneity of surface melt on the sub-pixel scale is often related to varying surface topography.

AB The Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) was constructed on a platform mainly reclaimed from the sea. The platform has experienced some significant settlement since its operation in 1998 due mainly to consolidation of the materials used in the land reclamation. Although some studies have been carried out to measure the settlement with techniques such as Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), the past studies have each only covered some limited time periods. Therefore, a complete history of settlement since the operation of the Airport has never been available to aid the understanding of the spatiotemporal behavior of the land settlement. We attempt for the first time to make full use of most of the available SAR data from multiple SAR sensors (ERS-2, ENVISAT ASAR, COSMO-SkyMed (CSK), and Sentinel-1A) to generate a settlement time series of the HKIA over 1998-2018 with an improved multi-temporal InSAR technique. In order to fill the time gaps between the different SAR datasets, a settlement model is developed based on the InSAR measurements. The results reveal both the spatial and temporal variations of the land settlement. They also show for the first time that the accumulative settlement reaches up to 40 cm over the past two decades. The settlement is largely associated with the material types used in the landfill works and the underlying alluvial sediments as some earlier research has indicated, and the stages of the reclamation works. The results are validated through cross-validation between the datasets and with leveling and GPS measurements on the Airport platform.

AB The characteristics of urban land surfaces contribute to the urban heat island, and, in turn, can exacerbate the severity of heat wave impacts. However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in urban areas underlying land surface temperature are still being understood. Understanding these mechanisms is necessary to design strategies that mitigate land temperatures in our cities. Using the recently available night-time moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery and employing advanced nonlinear statistical models, we seek to answer the question "What is the influence and relative importance of urban characteristics on land surface temperature, during both the day and night?" To answer this question, we analyze urban land surface temperature in four cities across the United States. We devise techniques for training and validating nonlinear statistical models on geostatistical data and use these models to assess the interdependent effects of urban characteristics on urban surface temperature. Our results suggest that vegetation and impervious surfaces are the most important urban characteristics associated with land surface temperature. While this may be expected, this is the first study to quantify this relationship for Landsat-resolution nighttime temperature estimates. Our results also demonstrate the potential for using nonlinear statistical analysis to investigate land surface temperature and its relationships with urban characteristics. Improved understanding of these relationships influencing both night and day land surface temperature will assist planners undertaking climate change adaptation and heat wave mitigation.

AB Water clarity is a well-established first-order indicator of water quality and has been used globally by water regulators in their monitoring and management programs. Assessments of water clarity in lakes over large temporal and spatial scales, however, are rare, limiting our understanding of its variability and the driven forces. In this study, we developed and validated a robust Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) algorithm for lakes across China based on two water color parameters, namely Forel-Ule Index (FUI) and hue angle alpha, retrieved from MODIS data. The MODIS Z(SD) model shows good results when compared with in-situ measurements from 17 lakes, with a 27.4% mean relative difference (MRD) in the validation dataset. Compared with other empirical Z(SD) models, our FUI and alpha-based model demonstrates improved performance and adaptability over a wide range of water clarity and trophic states. This algorithm was subsequently applied to MODIS measurements to provide a comprehensive assessment of water clarity in large lakes (N = 153) across China for the first time. The mean summer Z(SD) of the studied lakes between 2000 and 2017 demonstrated marked spatial and temporal variations. Spatially, the Z(SD) of large lakes presented a distinct spatial pattern of "high west and low east" over China. This spatial pattern was found to be associated with the significant differences in lake depth and altitude between west and east China while China's population, GDP, temperature, and precipitation distribution have also contributed to a certain extent. Temporally, the Z(SD) of most lakes increased during this period, with an overall mean rate of 3.3 cm/yr for all lakes. Here, 38.6% (N = 59) of the lakes experienced a significant increase in their Z(SD) value during the past 18 years while only 8.5% (N = 13) showed a significant decreasing trend. Significant increases in lake Z(SD) were observed in west China, which were found to correlate with the increase of air temperature and lake surface area. This is possibly a response of the lakes in west China to climate change. In the lake systems of east China, which are predominately used as a drinking water source, the increase in lake Z(SD) was found to be strongly correlated with changes in local GDP (gross domestic production), NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and lake surface area, suggesting a combined effect of the implemented management practices and climatic variability. The results of this study provide important information for water quality conservation and management in China, and also highlight the value of satellite remote sensing in monitoring water quality over lakes at a large scale and long-term.

AB Cropland abandonment is a widespread land-use change, but it is difficult to monitor with remote sensing because it is often spatially dispersed, easily confused with spectrally similar land-use classes such as grasslands and fallow fields, and because post-agricultural succession can take different forms in different biomes. Due to these difficulties, prior assessments of cropland abandonment have largely been limited in resolution, extent, or both. However, cropland abandonment has wide-reaching consequences for the environment, food production, and rural livelihoods, which is why new approaches to monitor long-term cropland abandonment in different biomes accurately are needed. Our goals were to 1) develop a new approach to map the extent and the timing of abandoned cropland using the entire Landsat time series, and 2) test this approach in 14 study regions across the globe that capture a wide range of environmental conditions as well as the three major causes of abandonment, i.e., social, economic, and environmental factors. Our approach was based on annual maps of active cropland and non-cropland areas using Landsat summary metrics for each year from 1987 to 2017. We streamlined per-pixel classifications by generating multi-year training data that can be used for annual classification. Based on the annual classifications, we analyzed land-use trajectories of each pixel in order to distinguish abandoned cropland, stable cropland, non-cropland, and fallow fields. In most study regions, our new approach separated abandoned cropland accurately from stable cropland and other classes. The classification accuracy for abandonment was highest in regions with industrialized agriculture (area-adjusted F1 score for Mato Grosso in Brazil: 0.8; Volgograd in Russia: 0.6), and drylands (e.g., Shaanxi in China, Nebraska in the U.S.: 0.5) where fields were large or spectrally distinct from non-cropland. Abandonment of subsistence agriculture with small field sizes (e.g., Nepal: 0.1) or highly variable climate (e.g., Sardinia in Italy: 0.2) was not accurately mapped. Cropland abandonment occurred in all study regions but was especially prominent in developing countries and formerly socialist states. In summary, we present here an approach for monitoring cropland abandonment with Landsat imagery, which can be applied across diverse biomes and may thereby improve the understanding of the drivers and consequences of this important land-use change process.

AB Landslides and resultant barrier lakes are significant threats to human lives and infrastructures. Three-dimensional (3D) surface displacements can give vital clues to the exploration of internal structure of landslides, but they are difficult to be retrieved from spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations due to the intrinsic limitation of SAR imaging geometry. Meanwhile, studies on predicting slope failure based on SAR-measured displacements are rarely seen. Here, we used SAR pixel offset tracking to investigate the Baige landslide before the collapse on 10 October 2018. 3D surface displacements retrieved by combining satellite SAR and optical observations revealed heterogeneous spatial patterns within the landslide complex. We observed linear secondary creep and accelerating tertiary creep prior to the failure from multi-sensor SAR data. The possibility of forecasting the failure was demonstrated by applying an inverse velocity method to the time-series displacements measured by Sentinel-1 during the tertiary creep, which is valuable for risk evaluation and disaster early warning.

AB Satellite remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) products are widely used in land-surface monitoring and modeling, especially for estimating global terrestrial photosynthetic activity through light use efficiency (LUE) models. PAR absorbed by active chlorophyll (APAR(chl)) is directly linked to vegetation photosynthesis and can be used to estimate ecosystem gross primary production (GPP). Previous studies have demonstrated that solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence has very tight relationship with APAR(chl) at various ecosystems. Therefore, the solar angle normalized SIF (nSIF) is directly related to the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll (FPAR(chl)). This paper intercompared six space FPAR products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). Their potential relationships with FPAR(chl) were indirectly evaluated with both spaceborne (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, OCO-2 and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, TROPOMI) and airborne (Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer, CFIS) nSIF data as well as in situ GPP measurements. Our results show that these FPAR products are different in terms of amplitudes and seasonal variations across biomes. Among six FPAR products, OLCI FPAR shows the best relationships with TROPOMI nSIF740, OCO-2 nSIF757, and CFIS nSIF755. The coefficient of determination (R-2) for the relationship between OLCI FPAR and TROPOMI nSIF740 is 0.79 +/- 0.17 on a global average. APAR calculated from OLCI also exhibits the best relationship (R-2 = 0.79) with in situ GPP over 25 flux towers.

AB Temperate grasslands are globally widespread, play an important role as carbon storage, and harbor unique biodiversity. Livestock grazing is the most widespread land use in temperate grasslands, and understanding the impact of grazing on grassland ecosystems is therefore important. However, monitoring grazing pressure and how it changes is hampered by a lack of adequate tools. The Eurasian steppe belt, extending from Eastern Europe to China has experienced marked changes in grazing pressure. Most notably, livestock numbers in the steppes of Kazakhstan and Russia declined by up to 80% after the breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991, yet how this impacted spatial patterns of grazing pressure is unclear. To address this research gap, we used all available Landsat data from 1985 to 2017 together with extensive ground reference data on grazing pressure to evaluate a broad range of spectral-temporal metrics regarding their ability to capture grazing pressure. While Tasseled Cap-based disturbance indices performed best, combining all spectral -temporal metrics in a binary random forest classification yielded a grazing class membership probability that strongly outperformed all individual metrics. This new index of grazing pressure correlated well with a range of field-based grazing indicators (e.g., number of dung piles, herbaceous biomass) and yielded highly plausible spatial patterns of grazing pressure. We used this index to reconstruct annual changes in grazing pressure across our 360,000 km(2) study region, and used LandTrendr time series segmentation to identify trends in grazing pressure. Aggregated grazing pressure followed closely known trends in total livestock numbers over the time period we studied. The spatial footprint of heavy grazing was very large before 1991, but decreased by 73 (+/- 2) % until 2017. This now leaves large areas virtually ungrazed, even in close vicinity to settlements and agricultural areas, and despite a recent recovery of livestock numbers. Our analyses uncovered previously unknown hot-spots of heavy grazing during Soviet times (e.g., around watering points). Our findings suggest potential for a further revival of the livestock sector as well as for the restoration of steppe ecosystems. More broadly, our study highlights how the Landsat archive, in combination with field data on grazing, can be used to map grazing pressure reliably across large areas and over long time spans.

AB Choosing appropriate scales for remotely sensed image classification is extremely important yet still an open question in relation to deep convolutional neural networks (CNN), due to the impact of spatial scale (i.e., input patch size) on the recognition of ground objects. Currently, the optimal scale selection processes are extremely cumbersome and time-consuming requiring repetitive experiments involving trial-and-error procedures, which significantly reduce the practical utility of the corresponding classification methods. This issue is crucial when trying to classify large-scale land use (LU) and land cover (LC) jointly (Zhang et al., 2019). In this paper, a simple and parsimonious Scale Sequence Joint Deep Learning (SS-JDL) method is proposed for joint LU and LC classification, in which a sequence of scales is embedded in the iterative process of fitting the joint distribution implicit in the joint deep learning (JDL) method, thus, replacing the previous paradigm of scale selection. The sequence of scales, derived autonomously and used to define the CNN input patch sizes, provides consecutive information transmission from small-scale features to large-scale representations, and from simple LC states to complex LU characterisations. The effectiveness of the novel SS-JDL method was tested on aerial digital photography of three complex and heterogeneous landscapes, two in Southern England (Bournemouth and Southampton) and one in North West England (Manchester). Benchmark comparisons were provided in the form of a range of LU and LC methods, including the state-of-the-art joint deep learning (JDL) method. The experimental results demonstrated that the SS-JDL consistently outperformed all of the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both LU and LC classification accuracies, as well as computational efficiency. The proposed SS-JDL method, therefore, represents a fast and effective implementation of the state-of-the-art JDL method. By creating a single, unifying joint distribution framework for classifying higher order feature representations, including LU, the SS-JDL method has the potential to transform the classification paradigm in remote sensing, and in machine learning more generally.

AB Southern Tunisia is one of the most significant areas of historical and archaeological interest as, since the Roman period, it has played a key role as a land bridge controlling the passage from the Saharan plain to plateaus and to the north of the mountain range between Chebika and Metlaoui. Because of the difficult geography, the investigation of ancient sites in this region is not easy and, therefore, satellite-based investigation can play an important role in the detection and documentation of archaeological sites. In this study, we combined high-resolution remote sensing (RS) imagery with in situ investigations to assess the suspected archaeological sites detected using satellite data and historical documentation. The suspected sites were confirmed according to the geometric features of the sites as they appeared in the remotely sensed imagery these sites had not been detected during earlier field investigations. In particular, we aimed to use 1-m spatial resolution WorldView-2 (WV2) imagery of the Wadi El-MelahValley (WMV) in Gafsa (also named Capsa). The satellite data were processed using statistical analysis and unsupervised classification.WV2 satellite imagery of WMV, Southwestern Tunisia, was processed within ArcGIS 10.2 to identify spatial features linked to the sites. The study outlines three different feature-extraction methods (GIS-based, unsupervised classification-based and statistical analysis-based). The satellite-based analysis and archaeological records were evaluated by RS and GIS prospecting in the area of the field survey to confirm the new discoveries. The results of remotely sensed data combined with field survey enabled us to reconstruct the military defense system consisting of is a linear defensive structure (limes) and forts related to the Imperial Roman period. Taken together, the results of our investigations provide new insights into some important sections of the Roman limes in the southern part of the empire. Other concealed remains are still to be found and explored.

AB This paper presents a Stage 3 validation of the recently released Collection 6 NASA MCD64A1 500 m global burned area product. The product is validated by comparison with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image pairs acquired 16 days apart that were visually interpreted. These independent reference data were selected using a stratified random sampling approach that allows for probability sampling of Landsat data in both time and in space. A total of 558 Landsat 8 OLI image pairs (1116 images), acquired between March 1st, 2014 and March 19th , 2015, were selected and used to validate the MCD64A1 product. The areal accuracy of the MCD64A1 product was characterized at the 30 m resolution of the Landsat independent reference data using standard accuracy metrics derived from global and from biome specific confusion matrices. Because a probability based Stage 3 sampling protocol was followed, unbiased estimators of the accuracy metrics and associated standard errors could be used. Globally, the MCD64A1 product had an estimated 40.2% commission error and 72.6% omission error; the prevalence of omission errors is reflected by a negative estimated bias of the mapped global area burned relative to the Landsat independent reference data ( - 54.1%). Globally, the standard errors of the accuracy metrics were less than 6%. The lowest errors were observed in the boreal forest biome (27.0% omission and 23.9% estimated commission errors) where burned areas tend to be large and distinct, and remain on the landscape for long periods, and the highest errors were in the Tropical Forest, Temperate Forest, and Mediterranean biomes (estimated > 90% omission error and > 50% commission error). The product accuracy was also characterized at coarser scale using metrics derived from the regression between the proportion of coarse resolution grid cells detected as burned by MCD64A1 and the proportion mapped in the Landsat 8 interpreted maps. The errors of omission and commission observed at 30 m resolution compensate to a considerable extent at coarser resolution, as indicated by the coefficient of determination (r(2) > 0.70), slope ( > 0.79) and intercept ( - 0.0030) of the regression between the MCD64A1 product and the Landsat independent reference data in 3 km, 4 km, 5 km, and 6 km coarse resolution cells. The Boreal Forest, Desert and Xeric Shrublands, Temperate Savannah and Tropical Savannah biomes had higher r(2) and slopes closer to unity than the Temperate Forest, Mediterranean, and Tropical Forest biomes. The analysis of the deviations between the proportion of area burned mapped by the MCD64A1 product and by the independent reference data, performed using 3 km x 3 km and 6 km x 6 km coarse resolution cells, indicates that the large negative bias in global area burned is primarily due to the systematic underestimation of smaller burned areas in the MCD64A1 product.

AB This study analyzes a multi-year dataset of equivalent black carbon (EBC) concentration collected in 2012-2015 by a 7-wavelengths Aethalometer at Centro Olio Val d'Agri (COVA) in southern Italy, which is the largest European oil pre-treatment plant. These data, together with the local air circulation analysis, were used to identify the black carbon (BC) sources in Agri valley, specifically the COVA plant and vehicular traffic. During a limited period of 2012-2013, simultaneous measurements of PM10 concentration were available for comparison with the EBC data, which revealed correlation values of 0.31-0.43 between PM10 and EBC indicating a relevant contribution of BC to particulate matter at the site. On average, EBC/PM10 ratio is 7%, a value equal to that found at an urban-background site in Rome measured during non-rush hours.
   Moreover, an ad hoc procedure combining EBC data, Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory back-trajectories (HYSPLIT), and satellite fire data enabled detection of days affected by the transport of carbonaceous particles. Both Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data were used as input for the algorithm, and the corresponding results were compared and discussed. VIIRS showed a better performance in detecting smaller/cooler hotspots especially in cases of flaring, as observed during flaring events at the COVA plant itself.
   Application of the procedure suggests that both regional and non-regional biomass burning episodes, which occur mainly during summer, could contribute to the BC load at the site.
   The approach applied to the case study of the present work can be useful for estimating the relative contributions of local and remote sources of BC.

AB A new approach of integration of remote sensing data with in situ pollen measurements is developed to explore the effect of changing land use on the local pollen records variability. It was conducted in a predominantly agricultural region of Serbia, with the focus on Ambrosia, an invasive weed that is the source of highly allergenic pollen. The land use characteristics were extracted from the Corine Land Cover and more precise crop classification maps for years 2013-2017 created using machine learning from the available satellite (RapidEye, Landsat, Sentinel) and ground truth data. Airborne pollen was collected at five locations for the same period. To integrate in situ and products derived from satellite data we defined catchment areas surrounding pollen measurements stations. Different shapes of assumed catchment areas equivalent to 5 km, 10 km and 30 km radius were tested: circular, wind rose and footprint from SILAM (System for Integrated modeLling of Atmospheric coMposition). The simple fixed circle, used as the rule of thumb in the literature, is a reasonable approximation of the representativeness of the aerobiological data. A gridded Ambrosia distribution and abundance map over Vojvodina was produced by using top-down approach that combines distribution of suitable habitats and airborne pollen concentrations. The results confirmed that variation in the agriculture-associated land use area explains notable amount of variability in the amount of Ambrosia airborne pollen. Detailed crop classification inferred from satellite data revealed the strongest relationship between pollen and variation in areas under soya bean and sugar beet. Maps of Ambrosia infection levels, based on distribution of sugar beet and soya bean fields, instead of total arable land, reveal its additional spatial variability in Vojvodina region.

AB Remotely sensed Earth observations (EO) have their history firmly rooted in agricultural monitoring, and more recently with applications in food production, food security, and sustainable agriculture. Still, after more than 45 years of observing the Earth's land surface, usage of EO data by operational monitoring entities concerned with global agriculture is uneven. One reason for this is a gap in continuous communication and collaboration between those who undertake research and development of methods for cropland assessment and monitoring, and those who have the mandate to report on agricultural indicators at a national, regional, and global scales. The recent international policy focus on the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development via its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is giving increased attention to measurements and indicators for monitoring and measuring progress for meeting these goals. Satellite EO provide a source of measurements beyond traditional census data collection and statistical reporting. In this vein, this overview paper describes the current and potential uses of EO data and tools that can support the SDGs, particularly highlighting the activities of the Group on Earth Observations Global Agricultural Monitoring (GEOGLAM) Initiative. GEOGLAM is composed of agricultural ministries, intergovernmental organizations, research entities, universities, space agencies, and members of industry concerned with agricultural monitoring. This GEOGLAM community has a broad portfolio of activities which provide information on the state and changes in agricultural production and land use that can be considered as contributions to both supporting the attainment of several of the 17 SDGs and many of their 169 Targets, as well as monitoring their achievement via the Global Indicator Framework. GEOGLAM contributes in particular to Goal 2: Zero Hunger, but also has less immediately apparent contributions in the realms of water (Goal 6), responsible consumption and production (Goal 12), climate action (Goal 13), life on land (Goal 15), and global partnerships for sustainable development (Goal 17). We further characterize the applicability and use of EO data products and tools as they correspond with the United Nations Interagency Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goals (IAEG-SDGs) Global Indicator Framework. This inventory will be complemented by a discussion of the intersection of other policy mandates with the SDGs in the agriculture and food security contexts, and will conclude with a discussion of approaches to improving awareness of EO value and bridging the gap between policy and EO communities, to the societal benefit of all with no one left behind.

AB Remote sensing of soil moisture and vegetation water content from space often requires inversion of a zeroth-order approximation of the forward radiative transfer equation in L-band, known as the t-? model. This paper shows that the least-squares inversion of the model is not strictly convex and the widely used unconstrained damped least-squares (DLS) can lead to biased retrievals, due to preferential descending paths. In particular, the numerical experiments show that for sparse (dense) vegetation with a low (high) opacity, the DLS tends to overestimate (underestimate) the soil moisture and vegetation water content when the soil is dry (wet). A new Constrained Multi-Channel Algorithm (CMCA) is proposed that confines the retrievals with a priori information about the soil type and vegetation density and accounts for slow temporal changes of the vegetation water content through a smoothing-norm regularization. It is demonstrated that depending on the resolution of the constraints, the algorithm can lead to high-resolution soil moisture retrievals beyond the radiometric spatial resolution. Controlled numerical experiments are conducted and the results are validated against ground-based gauge observations using the passive microwave observations by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Satellite.

AB The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite - 2 (ICESat-2) observatory was launched on 15 September 2018 to measure ice sheet and glacier elevation change, sea ice freeboard, and enable the determination of the heights of Earth's forests. ICESat-2's laser altimeter, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) uses green (532 nm) laser light and single-photon sensitive detection to measure time of flight and subsequently surface height along each of its six beams. In this paper, we describe the major components of ATLAS, including the transmitter, the receiver and the components of the timing system. We present the major components of the ICESat-2 observatory, including the Global Positioning System, star trackers and inertial measurement unit. The ICESat-2 Level 1B data product (ATL02) provides the precise photon round-trip time of flight, among other data. The ICESat-2 Level 2A data product (ATL03) combines the photon times of flight with the observatory position and attitude to determine the geodetic location (i.e. the latitude, longitude and height) of the ground bounce point of photons detected by ATLAS. The ATL03 data product is used by higher-level (Level 3A) surface-specific data products to determine glacier and ice sheet height, sea ice freeboard, vegetation canopy height, ocean surface topography, and inland water body height.

AB NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and ESA's Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) carry satellite L-band radiometers whose primary missions are to measure soil moisture. However, they also allow retrieving of vegetation optical depth (VOD), the degree to which vegetation attenuates microwave radiation. Because attenuation is primarily a function of the total amount of liquid water in a vegetation canopy that is contained within vegetation tissue, VOD could be used to monitor seasonal changes in this quantity, which we call crop water, in major agricultural regions such as the US Corn Belt. There are two main advantages of L-band VOD: it observes the entire canopy volume because soil moisture sensitivity is maintained throughout the growing season; and since it is unaffected by cloud cover there are close to daily measurements. To show its value, we compare SMAP and SMOS VOD to satellite-scale estimates of crop productivity created using the Agricultural Integrated BIosphere Simulator (Agro-IBIS) and observed weather at the South Fork SMAP Core Validation Site in the Corn Belt state of Iowa. We find that SMAP and SMOS VOD are directly proportional to crop water. New empirical models that relate crop water to crop dry mass were required to make this finding. We created these models with in situ data spanning multiple years and stages of crop development. The value of the proportionality constant (or "b-parameter") relating VOD to crop water at the satellite scale is about half as large as previous estimates. Because L-band VOD is directly proportional to crop water at the satellite scale, and because we understand the relationship between crop water and crop dry mass, SMAP and SMOS have the potential to evaluate the large-scale performance of crop models in the Corn Belt on a near daily basis.

AB Wind observations in the marine environment are both costly and sparse. This makes wind retrievals from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) an attractive option in connection with planning of offshore wind farms. Because the wind power density is proportional to the wind speed cubed, it is important to achieve the highest possible absolute accuracy on SAR wind speed retrievals for wind energy applications. A method is presented for inter-calibration of SAR observations from Envisat and Sentinel-1A/B. Sensor-specific effects on the SAR-retrieved wind speeds are first quantified through comparisons against collocated ocean buoy observations. Based on global circulation model simulations of wind speed and direction, we retrieve the Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) for different radar incidence angles. Residuals between the retrieved and the observed NRCS are used to inter-calibrate the observed NRCS before reprocessing to SAR wind fields. The inter-calibration leads to an improved agreement between SAR and buoy wind speeds with biases below 0.2 m s(-1) for all investigated SAR sensors. Estimates of the wind resource improve with respect to the buoy observations for ten of the twelve sites investigated. The average deviation between wind power densities is reduced from 20% to 8% as the SAR inter calibration leads to more conservative estimates of the wind resource.

AB Wind streaks are common aeolian features observed on terrestrial planets. They were first identified on Mars; thus, the associated terminology is based on Mars-related observations usually describing surface patterns with distinct albedos. However, terms related to reflected tones are only relevant to past knowledge for Mars, and not necessarily suitable for description of radar-visible streaks located on Venus, Titan, or Earth. Furthermore, the sensor type used to observe wind streaks can influence the subsequent data analysis. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of sensor type on wind streak identification and interpretation. Six case studies featuring wind streaks on Earth were performed, using imaging by both radar and optical sensors. The results indicate that wind streak identification is constrained to a specific combination of sensor settings appropriate for the local surface properties. Only half the optically visible wind streaks considered in this study were also radar visible, but all the wind streaks observable in the radar images also appeared in the optical images. Furthermore, "bright" and "dark" (reflectance and backscatter) are relative terms and should be used with caution. These results suggest that the Venusian wind streak database is most likely far from complete and that many more streaks exist.

AB Fire is used worldwide to clear natural vegetation areas for economic activities and to manage the regeneration of already opened sites. In Brazil, fire has been traditionally used to convert natural vegetation areas to agricultural lands (slash and burn) and to manage pastures for livestock. We developed the Burned Area Spectral Mixture Analysis (BASMA) algorithm in Google Earth Engine, which is designed to process Landsat data to produce a multi-temporal fire scar database representing annual burned area for an extent of 362,000 km(2) in the transition zone between the Amazon forest and the Cerrado biome. This region is considered a conservation hotspot, given its high deforestation rates over the last four decades. We digitally processed a 32-year time-series (1985 to 2017) of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+, and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data to map fire scars based on sub-pixel char fraction, aiming to generate a consistent burned area product at a finer scale and covering a longer period than those currently available for the region. Manually interpreted reference burned area polygons for each annual mosaic was used to guide the definition of the best fire scar endmember and its fraction threshold. To assess our BASMA-delineated fire scar, they were compared to independent datasets of manually delineated burned area produced by visual analysis of finer spatial resolution imagery, returning an average Dice Coefficient value of 0.86. Accuracy was also measured against the 30-meter Burned Area product available at the 'Queimadas' data portal. A total of 11,106,258 ha was mapped as having been affected by fire during the annual dry season over the 32 years, which represents 30.7% of the study region. Results showed a decreasing trend in the annual amount of burned area over the time-series. It reflects a similar pattern shown in the deforestation rate for the Legal Amazon, measured by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research - INPE. Moreover, the Cerrado biome subset of the study region consistently showed higher burned area when compared to the Amazon forest subset. Our findings provide robust evidence that our approach is a consistent method to identify and delineate fire scars for large areas over a long time-series in a very efficient fashion, given the digital processing power of Google Earth Engine, which reduces the time necessary to analyze such big amount of data.

AB Biodiversity science and conservation alike require environmental indicators to understand species richness and predict species distribution patterns. The Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) are a set of three indices that summarize annual productivity measures from satellite data for biodiversity applications, and include: a) cumulative annual productivity; b) minimum annual productivity; and c) variation in annual productivity. At global scales and in temperate regions the DHIs predict species diversity patterns well, but the DHIs have not been tested in the tropics, where higher levels of productivity lead to the saturation of many remotely sensed vegetation indices. Our goal was to explain bird species richness patterns based on the DHIs in tropical areas. We related the DHIs to species richness of resident landbirds for five guilds (forest, scrub, grassland, generalist, and all resident birds) based on a) species distribution model (SDM) maps for 217 species, and b) range map for 564 species across Thailand. We also quantified the relative importance of the DHIs in multiple regression models that included two measures of topography, and two climate metrics using multiple regression, best-subsets, and hierarchical partitioning analyses. We found that the three DHIs alone explained forest bird richness best (R-adj(2) 0.61 for both SDM- and rangemap based richness; 0.15-0.54 for the other guilds). When combining the DHIs with topography and climate, the richness of both forest birds and all resident bird species was equally well explained (R-adj(2) 0.85 and 0.67 versus 0.81 and 0.68). Among the three DHIs, cumulative annual productivity had the greatest explanatory power for all guilds based on SDM richness maps (R-adj(2) 0.54-0.61). The strong relationship between the DHIs and bird species richness in Thailand suggests that the DHIs capture energy availability well and are useful in biodiversity assessments and potentially bird conservation in tropical areas.

AB Improved monitoring of inundation area variations in lakes and reservoirs is crucial for assessing surface water resources in a growing population and a changing climate. Although long-record optical satellites, such as Landsat missions, provide sub-monthly observations at fairly fine spatial resolution, cloud contamination often poses a major challenge for producing temporally continuous time series. We here proposed a novel method to improve the temporal frequency of usable Landsat observations for mapping lakes and reservoirs, by effectively recovering inundation areas from contaminated images. This method automated three primary steps on the cloud-based platform Google Earth Engine. It first leveraged multiple spectral indices to optimize water mapping from archival Landsat images acquired since 1992. Errors induced by minor contaminations were next corrected by the topology of isobaths extracted from nearly cloud-free images. The isobaths were then used to recover water areas under major contaminations through an efficient vector-based interpolation. We validated this method on 428 lakes/reservoirs worldwide that range from similar to 2 km(2) to similar to 82,000 km(2) with time-variable levels measured by satellite altimeters. The recovered water areas show a relative root-mean-squared error of 2.2%, and the errors for over 95% of the lakes/reservoirs below 6.0%. The produced area time series, combining those from cloud-free images and recovered from contaminated images, exhibit strong correlations with altimetry levels (Spearman's rho mostly similar to 0.8 or larger) and extended the hypsometric (area-level) ranges revealed by cloud-free images alone. The combined time series also improved the monthly coverage by an average of 43%, resulting in a bi-monthly water area record during the satellite altimetry era thus far (1992-2018). The robustness of this method was further verified under five challenging mapping scenarios, including fluvial lakes in humid basins, reservoirs with complex shape geometries, saline lakes with high mineral concentrations, lakes/reservoirs in mountainous regions, and pan-Arctic lakes with frequent snow/ice covers. Given such performance and a generic nature of this method, we foresee its potential applications to assisting water area recovery for other optical and SAR sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2 and SWOT), and to estimating lake/reservoir storage variations in conjunction with altimetry sensors.

AB The Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI) is an agricultural drought index derived from multiple remote sensing datasets including precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and temperature and vegetation index from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The SDCI can be used for large-scale drought monitoring at a high spatial resolution in dry and humid regions. However, it is not applicable to certain areas for numerous reasons, including the discontinued service and limited coverage of the TRMM, uncertainties associated with the coarse resolution of precipitation input, the fixed lag time between precipitation deficit and vegetation responses, experimental weights and an arbitrary classification scheme. Therefore, this study aims to propose an optimal SDCI (OSDCI) using an alternative Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) as precipitation input, adding a varied lag time between precipitation and vegetation response, determining the optimal weights of variables and revising the severity classification. In Central Asia, OSDCI is calibrated using the 3-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) during the 2001-2008 growing seasons as drought reference. The SPEI from 2009 to 2016, soil moisture anomalies (SMAs) derived from both the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), and the annual crop production of wheat and barley are used for cross-validation. For comparison, three original SDCIs are also included. The results show that the OSDCI displays better performance than the three experimental SDCIs with higher correlation coefficients relative to SPEI and SMA from the CPC for different cover types, and performance is comparable to that of SMA from the GLDAS and annual crop production. Additionally, the OSDCI based on the revised classification scheme (OSDCI_rev) shows significant superiority over the OSDCI based on the original classification system (OSDCI org) with lower drought frequency and area error. Furthermore, the OSDCI_rev can capture both the temporal evolution and the spatial patterns of droughts exemplified by the SPEI and SMAs. Overall, the results of this study show the potential use of the OSDCI with a revised classification scheme as a remote sensing drought index for agricultural drought monitoring.

AB Comprehensive assessments on the reliability of remotely sensed soil moisture products are undeniably essential for their advancement and application. With the establishment of extensive dense networks across the globe, mismatches between satellite footprints and ground single-point observations can be feasibly relieved. In this study, five remotely sensed soil moisture products, namely, the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), two Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) products, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), were systematically investigated by utilizing in-situ soil moisture observations from global dense and sparse networks. Distinguished from previous studies, several perturbing factors comprising the surface temperature, vegetation optical depth (VOD), surface roughness and spatial heterogeneity were taken into account in this investigation. Furthermore, products' skills under various climate regions were also evaluated.
   Through the results, the SMAP product captures temporal trends of ground soil moisture, exhibiting an averaged R of 0.729, whereas for overall accuracy, ESA CCI outperformed other products with a slightly smaller ubRMSE of 0.041 m(3) m(-3) and a bias of -0.005 m(3) m(-3). This complementarity between SMAP and ESA CCI was further demonstrated under different climate conditions and can afford the reference of their integration for a more reliable global soil moisture product. Though some underestimations still exist, the newly developed SMOS- INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) was illustrated to gain considerable upgrades with regard to R and ubRMSE compared to SMOS-L3 product, especially in dense VOD conditions achieving the highest R compared to other products.
   Generally, the underestimations of the European Centre for Medium-Range-Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) surface temperature used for SMOS under moderate or high VOD, heterogeneity, and most surface roughness conditions were consistent with the underestimations of the soil moisture product and provide the directions of product promotions. As for LPRM surface temperature, the worse skills can partially explain the unsatisfactory performances for LPRM soil moisture products. In spite of relatively acceptable skills of SMAP and SMOS-IC soil moisture products concerning R under moderate or dense VOD, small surface roughness, low heterogeneity conditions and temperate and cold climate types, advances in soil moisture products under high or even slightly low VOD, high roughness or topography complexity and heterogeneity, as well as in tropical or desert regions, remain challenging. It is expected that these findings can contribute to algorithm refinements, product enhancements (e.g., fusion and disaggregation) and hydrometeorological usages.

AB In June 2018, the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) mission was launched to measure plant temperatures and better understand how they respond to stress. While the ECOSTRESS mission delivers imagery with similar to 60 m spatial resolution, it is often useful to have spectra at the leaf level in order to explain variability seen at the pixel level. As it was originally titled, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) spectral library version 2.0 has been expanded to support ECOSTRESS studies by including major additions of laboratory measured vegetation and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) spectra. The library now contains 541 leaf visible shortwave infrared (VIS/SWIR) spectra, 472 leaf thermal infrared (TIR) spectra, and 51 NPV VIS/SWIR and TIR spectra. Previously, the library primarily contained VSWIR and TIR laboratory spectra of minerals, rocks, and man-made materials. This new library, containing over 3000 spectra, was renamed the ECOSTRESS spectral library version 1.0 and is publicly available (http://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov). It should be noted that as with the prior versions of the library, the VSWIR and TIR measurements were made with separate instruments with different calibration sources. Care should be taken when combining the data into a seamless spectrum to cover the entire spectral range. The ECOSTRESS spectral library provides a comprehensive collection of natural and man-made laboratory collected spectra covering the wavelength range of 0.35-15.4 mu m.

AB The fundamental issue of mean eddy shape at the sea surface has been simplified as axially symmetric for a long time. This assumption is worth of a reexamination following significant advances in precise tracking of individual eddies, thanks to the recent availability of merged altimeter data with a grid resolution of 1/4 degrees x 1/4 degrees and a time interval of one day. Based on an orientationally aligned average of the effective boundaries of nearly 2.6 million individual eddies available to date, a characteristic shape of a "standard" eddy has been derived, which is found to be a very good approximation to a mathematical ellipsoid with a semimajor axis of a = 87.0 km, and a semiminor axis of b = 54.0 km. The oval nature of oceanic eddies appears to be universal in a climatological sense, but the best-fit ellipse varies with space and time. Statistically, the eddy ellipse has two preferred angles for its major axis: a primary angle of 104 degrees/284 degrees (nearly north-south) and a secondary angle of 1717351 (nearly east-west). The intrinsic geometric asymmetry in eddy shape and orientation is believed to be one of the fundamental reasons behind the previously observed geophysical anisotropy in eddy properties. Future integrated analysis in an eddy-centric coordinate system with an ellipse geometry may open a new window into nonlinear mesoscale oceanography in terms of eddy kinetics and eddy dynamics.

AB Vegetation phenology contributes to, and is diagnostic of, seasonal variation in ecosystem processes and exerts important controls on land-atmosphere exchanges of carbon, water, and energy. Satellite remote sensing provides a valuable source of data for monitoring the phenology of terrestrial ecosystems and has been widely used to map geographic and interannual variation in land surface phenology (LSP) over large areas. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) land surface phenology product provides global data sets characterizing the annual LSP of terrestrial ecosystems, and is designed to support long-term continuity of LSP measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We used data from VIIRS and MODIS to evaluate the agreement and characterize the similarities and differences between LSP data from each instrument. Specifically, we compare data from the Collection 6 MODIS Land Cover Dynamics (LCD) product with data from the newly developed VIIRS LSP product over the most common land cover types in North America. To do this, we assessed the overall agreement between time series of vegetation indices from VIIRS and MODIS, evaluated the correspondence between retrieved phenometrics from each instrument, and analyzed sources of differences between phenometrics from the each product. As part of this analysis, we also compared phenometrics from MODIS and VIIRS with phenometrics derived from Landsat Analysis Ready Data and PhenoCam time series. Results show that two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) values from VIIRS and MODIS are similar (R-2 > 0.81; root mean square deviation < 0.062), but that VIIRS EVI2 time series show more high frequency variation than time series from MODIS. Further, even though the VIIRS and MODIS products are generated using different instruments and algorithms, phenometrics from each product are similar and show only minor differences within and across land cover types. Systematic differences between phenometrics from the two products were generally less than one week (absolute bias 4.8 +/- 3.0 days), and RMSDs were less than two weeks for most phenometrics across different land cover classes (10.7 +/- 4.3 days). Comparison of VIIRS and MODIS LSP data with corresponding metrics estimated from Landsat and PhenoCam data consistently showed high agreement among the data sets. Overall, results from this analysis indicate that the VIIRS LSP product provides excellent continuity with the MODIS record. However, studies attempting to create high-fidelity long-term LSP time series by merging these products should exploit the overlap period of MODIS and VIIRS to estimate land cover-specific corrections for modest systematic bias in the MODIS LCD product relative to the VIIRS LSP product.

AB Measurements of QuikScat for 2000-2009 and ASCAT scatterometers for 2009-2016 are used to describe the variability of the Black Sea wind velocity and wind curl. High-resolution (12.5 km) scatterometry data provide a possibility to investigate several small-scale features ("hot points") of the wind field in the basin related to the topographic effects. They include: the gap winds near the Bosphorus, the Kerch Strait, and Tuapse; tip jets at the south and west of the Crimean peninsula, several capes of the Anatolian coast; the Kolkheti valley winds; wind shadow zones at the eastern Turkey coast and the western Crimean coast. Driving factors and directional variability of wind in these "hot points" is discussed.
   QuikScat and ASCAT data are used to describe seasonal and interannual variability of wind characteristics in 2000-2016. Comparison with in-situ data shows that QuikScat noticeably overestimates wind magnitude during low winds conditions ( < 2 m/s). ASCAT winds are generally lower than QuikScat, but the ASCAT wind curl is higher. The amount of low winds values ( < 2 m/s) in the ASCAT data is 6% of the total data, and it is 1% in the QuikScat data. Overestimation of low winds decreases wind gradients near the wind shadows, which is the most possible reason of the underestimation of the wind curl in the QuikScat dataset.
   Wind curl has a different sign and a completely different interannual variability in the western and eastern parts of the sea. Near the eastern coast of the basin, high-resolution satellite measurements reveal three powerful small-scales maximums of cyclonic vorticity. These maximums are related to the wind jets flowing around topographic obstacles in the vicinity of the Kerch Strait, in the mountain gap near Tuapse, and from the Kolkheti valley. They are observed throughout the whole year, but are largest in winter. The contribution of these maximums to the overall cyclonic vorticity is essential (30% in the QuikScat data and 50% in the ASCAT data). In the western part of the basin, the wind curl is negative (anticyclonic) on average, with the highest anticyclonic curl observed in summer. Winds are decreasing in 2000-2016 in agreement with the data on the 20 century. At the same time the basin-average wind curl rises due to its increase in the eastern Black Sea. We speculate that these trends are associated with the displacement of the Siberian Anticyclone to the west. The related rise of pressure over the eastern Europe correlates significantly with the wind curl variability on interannual time scales.

AB Wetlands are valuable ecosystems providing a variety of important ecosystem services such as food supply and flood control. Due to increasing anthropogenic influences and the impact of climate change, wetlands are increasingly threatened and degraded. An effective monitoring of wetlands is therefore necessary to preserve and restore these endangered ecosystems. Earth Observation (EO) data offer a great potential to support cost-effective and large-scale monitoring of wetlands. Current state-of-the-art methods for wetland mapping, however, require large training data and manual effort and can therefore only be locally applied. The focus of this study is to evaluate a methodology for large-scale and highly automated wetland mapping based on current EO data streams. For this purpose, an algorithm for water and wetness detection based on multi-temporal optical imagery and topographic data is presented. Suitable spectral indices sensitive to water and wetness were identified using feature selection methods based on mutual information between optical indices and occurrence of water and wetness. In combination with the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), these were used to derive monthly water and wetness masks using a dynamic thresholding approach. Aggregating all observations corrected for seasonal bias yielded flooding and wetness frequencies and the Water Wetness Presence (or Probability) Index (WWPI) as an indicator for wetland occurrence or a pre-inventory. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, the algorithm is demonstrated at three study sites with different wetland types in Kenya/Uganda, Algeria, and Austria using Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) imagery. For all sites, the overall accuracy was above 92%. User's and producer's accuracies were higher for water (> 96%) than for wetness (> 75%). Due to the high degree of automation and low processing time, the proposed method is applicable on a large scale and has already been applied during the production of the Copernicus High Resolution Water-Wetness Layer and within the European Space Agency (ESA) project GlobWetland Africa.

AB In an Area Based Approach (ABA) to forest inventories using Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data, the sample plot size may vary or the cell size may differ from the plot size. Although this resolution mismatch may cause bias and increase in prediction error, it has not been thoroughly studied. The aim of this study was to clarify the meaning of resolution dependence in ABA, and to further identify its causal factors and quantify their effects. In general, a number of factors contribute to resolution dependence in ABA forest inventories, including the varying point density of the ALS data, the type of response variable, how the predictor variables are computed, and the properties of the prediction model. For quantification, we used field plots with mapped tree locations, which enabled the generation of different sized sample plots inside a larger plot. Plot level above ground biomass (AGB) was the response variable employed in all the models. The error rate seemed to increase when the prediction plots were larger than the fitting plots, and vice versa. The maximum BIAS was 1.50% and the maximum change of RMSE compared to its value in native resolution was 0.97% when there was a 4-fold difference in resolution. This indicates that the resolution effect is small in most real-world use cases, however, resolution effect should be carefully considered in ALS-assisted large area inventories that target unbiased estimates of forest parameters.

AB Near real-time monitoring systems of forest disturbance are essential to reduce illegal logging and global deforestation, but the assessment of their performance varies greatly and rarely adheres to recommended assessment practices. Current assessment protocols recommended in the published literature focus on sample-based estimation of area and accuracy of features in remote sensing-based maps, which is less relevant for assessing the performance of near real-time monitoring systems. Rather than area bias and accuracy of mapped features, the objective of near real-time monitoring is fast detection of forest disturbance events. Here we present a new assessment framework as well as two new algorithms for near real-time monitoring of tropical forest disturbance. The first algorithm (NRT-CCDC) fits time series models based on MODIS data to predict future observations. Detections of forest disturbance are labeled as "low-probability", "high-probability", and "confirmed" based on the number of consecutive observations that deviate substantially from the prediction. The second algorithm (Fusion2) predicts MODIS observations at a high temporal frequency by building a model based on a time series of Landsat observations. Fusion2 utilizes daily MODIS observations from both Terra and Aqua to achieve rapid detection of disturbance events. A framework for assessing the performance of near real-time monitoring is presented that focuses on the timing and minimum detectable size of forest disturbance events while still being based on probability sampling and design-based inference. Central to the framework is a new metric we refer to as the "alert-lag relationship", which characterizes the frequency of omitted disturbance events as a function of the time lag between the dates of disturbance and detection. When applied to three different near-real monitoring systems representing three levels of operational readiness (Fusion2, NRT-CCDC and Terra-i), we found that Fusion2 achieved an alert accuracy (event-based agreement) of 50% after 82 days and NRT-CCDC achieved 50% after 126 days. Terra-i never achieved an alert accuracy of 50% but achieved 30% after 109 days. In terms of event size, all three systems showed better performance in detecting large events compared to small events. The smallest event detected by the three systems was 6.5 ha. Conventional accuracy assessment (pixel-based agreement) showed that the user's accuracy, which characterizes commission errors, of the disturbance class for Fusion2, NRT-CCDC, and Terra-i were 87%, 79%, and 30% respectively. The two more complex systems, Fusion2 and NRT-CCDC were consistently more accurate than the operational Terra-i system. In general, the higher the cost of implementing the system corresponded to a higher accuracy of the detection system. A primary objective moving forward is to make the NRT-CCDC and Fusion2 more operational over larger areas.

AB As the largest Asian river and fourth world's largest river by water flow, the Changjiang River transports a considerable amount of terrigenous particulate organic carbon (POC) into ocean, which has experienced significant pressure from human activities. We conducted monthly sampling (from May 2015 to May 2016) at Datong, the most downstream non-tidal hydrological station along the Changjiang River. To monitor long-term POC variations, we developed a two-step POC algorithm for Landsat satellite data and calculated monthly POC flux during 2000-2016. Monthly POC flux ranged from a minimum of 1.4 x 10(4) t C in February 2016 to a maximum of 52.04 x 10(4) t C in May 2002, with a mean of 13.04 x 10(4) t C/month. At Datong, monthly POC flux was positively exponentially related to water flow (N = 118, R = 0.69, p < 0.01). In the wet season (May to October) with high water flow, a large amount of terrigenous POC was flushed into the Changjiang River. After the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), both POC concentration (R = 0.46, p < 0.01) and POC flux (R = 0.33, p < 0.01) significantly exponentially decreased during 2000-2016. After 2011 with regular operation of the TGD, POC transport at Datong showed relative stability and its seasonal difference became smaller. POC concentration from the TGD to Datong in the Changjiang mainstream (similar to 1000 km) was also derived from Landsat data, which was spatially varied with water flow, slope gradient, and watercourse width. This study improved our understanding of the spatiotemporal variations of POC transport in the Changjiang mainstream, especially the influences of the TGD construction.

AB Monitoring grassland plant communities is crucial for understanding and managing biodiversity. Previous studies indicate that mapping these natural habitats from single-date remotely sensed imagery remains challenging because some communities have similar physiognomy. The recently launched Sentinel-2 satellites are a promising opportunity for monitoring vegetation. This article assesses the advantages of Sentinel-2 time-series for discriminating plant communities in wet grasslands. An annual Sentinel-2 time-series was compared respectively to single-date and single-band datasets derived from this time-series for mapping grassland plant communities in a temperate floodplain located near Mont-Saint-Michel Bay, which is included in the long-term ecological research network "ZA Armorique" (France). At this 475 ha site, 123 vegetation releves were collected and assigned to seven plant communities to calibrate and validate the Sentinel-2 data. Satellite images were classified using support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers. Results show that the SVM classifier performs slightly better than the RF classifier (overall accuracy 0.78 and 0.71, respectively). They highlight that accuracy is lower when using single-date (0.67) or single-band images (0.70). The results also reveal that discrimination of plant communities is more sensitive to temporal resolution (Delta = 0.34 in overall accuracy) than spectral resolution (Delta = 0.12 in overall accuracy).

AB Drylands account for approximately 40% of the global land surface and play a dominant role in the trend and variability of terrestrial carbon uptake and storage. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis termed gross primary productivity (GPP) is a critical driver of terrestrial carbon uptake and remains challenging to be observed directly. Currently, vegetation indices that largely capture changes in greenness are the most commonly used datasets in satellite-based GPP modeling. However, there remains significant uncertainty in the spatiotemporal relationship between greenness indices and GPP, especially for relatively heterogeneous dryland ecosystems. In this paper, we compared vegetation greenness indices from PhenoCam and satellite (Landsat and MODIS) observations against GPP estimates from the eddy covariance technique, across three representative ecosystem types of the southwestern United States. We systematically evaluated the changes in the relationship between vegetation greenness indices and GPP: i) across spatial scales of canopy-level, 30-meter, and 500-meter resolution; and ii) across temporal scale of daily, 8-day, 16-day, and monthly resolution. We found that greenness-GPP relationships were independent of spatial scales as long as land cover type and composition remained relatively constant. We also found that the greenness-GPP relationships became stronger as the time interval increased, with the strongest relationships observed at the monthly resolution. We posit that the greenness-GPP relationship breaks down at short timescales because greenness changes more slowly than plant physiological function, which responds rapidly to changes in key biophysical drivers. These findings provide insights into the potential for and limitations of modeling GPP using remotely sensed greenness indices across dryland ecosystem types.

AB In this article, there is an overview of the potential of different (mostly altimetry-derived) products for manifesting features of basin- and mesoscale circulation of the Western Mediterranean Basin. In terms of detection of mesoscale eddies and larger gyres, the comparison was performed between eddy statistics extracted directly from fields of sea surface temperature (SST), on the one hand, and reconstructed from different scalar and vector altimetry-derived fields, on the other hand. Among the products being analysed, there are fields of (i) sea level anomaly (SLA), (ii) geostrophic currents, and (iii) finite size Lyapunov exponents (FSLE). Comparison of the eddy statistics provided by such different data sources revealed that altimetry-based techniques tended to overestimate the number of big cyclones and thus failed to reproduce cyclonic/anticyclonic eddy asymmetry which was shown by fields of SST. Defining the spatial scale of eddies via altimetry-based techniques seemed particularly problematic. FSLE product analysed in the study showed significant disagreements with vortical structures observed in fields of SST both in terms of the spatial scale and the sign of rotation. In order to scrutinize basin-scale features of surface circulation in the region of interest, fields of (i) geostrophic currents, (ii) total currents reconstructed by the GlobCurrent project, and (iii) surface currents provided by the reanalysis technique were analysed. As a result of the comparison performed, a conclusion was made on the complementarily of the datasets analysed.

AB This study assessed the application of airborne imaging spectroscopy to monitor alpha-diversity in restored grassland plots. The study site was located within the Central Platte River ecosystem, south of Wood River in Central Nebraska, USA, and consisted of two sets of plots (young and old). Exotic species had recently invaded the old plots, confounding the original study design, while the young plots did not have significant invasion by weeds, reflecting the original study design. We used spectral variation (i.e. spectral diversity, expressed as the coefficient of variation) as a proxy for alpha-diversity (expressed as species richness and Shannon index). Airborne data collected at two flight altitudes and two flight directions tested the validity of "spectral diversity-alpha-diversity" relationship at different sampling scales and flight directions. Our results showed a strong relationship between spectral diversity and alpha-diversity in young, non-invaded plots exhibiting strong differences in alpha-diversity. However, in the old, invaded plots, the spectral diversity-alpha-diversity relationship was non-significant. Factors likely contributing to this failure in the old plots included the spatial mismatch between airborne and field-based sampling, the convergence in diversity levels over time, and the unique reflectance signatures of the invasive species related to their different structural and phenological properties. Unlike previous airborne studies in manipulated experimental prairie plots, but similar to results in more natural settings, the strong spectral diversity-alpha-diversity relationship in the young plots remained even at the spatial resolution of 1 m, demonstrating the potential of airborne remote sensing to assess diversity patterns in prairie grasslands. These findings demonstrate the importance of experimental remote sensing in evaluating spectral diversity, and provide insight for the development of operational airborne methods to assess biodiversity.

AB Hundreds of millions of hectares of tropical forest have been selectively logged, either legally or illegally. Methods for detecting and monitoring tropical selective logging using satellite data are at an early stage, with current methods only able to detect more intensive timber harvest (> 20 m(3) ha(-1)). The spatial resolution of widely available datasets, like Landsat, have previously been considered too coarse to measure the subtle changes in forests associated with less intensive selective logging, yet most present-day logging is at low intensity. We utilized a detailed selective logging dataset from over 11,000 ha of forest in Rondonia, southern Brazilian Amazon, to develop a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm for detecting low-intensity selective logging (< 15 m(3) ha(-1)) We show that Landsat imagery acquired before the cessation of logging activities (i.e. the final cloud-free image of the dry season during logging) was better at detecting selective logging than imagery acquired at the start of the following dry season (i.e. the first cloud-free image of the next dry season). Within our study area the detection rate of logged pixels was approximately 90% (with roughly 20% commission and 8% omission error rates) and approximately 40% of the area inside low-intensity selective logging tracts were labelled as logged. Application of the algorithm to 6152 ha of selectively logged forest at a second site in Park northeast Brazilian Amazon, resulted in the detection of 2316 ha (38%) of selective logging (with 20% commission and 7% omission error rates). This suggests that our method can detect low-intensity selective logging across large areas of the Amazon. It is thus an important step forward in developing systems for detecting selective logging pan-tropically with freely available data sets, and has key implications for monitoring logging and implementing carbon-based payments for ecosystem service schemes.

AB In the event of a flood disaster, first response agencies need inundation maps produced in near real time (NRT). Such maps can be generated using satellite-based information. In this study, we developed mapping techniques that rely on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on-board earth-orbiting platforms. SAR provides valid ground surface measurements through cloud cover with high resolution and sampling frequency that has recently increased through multiple missions. Despite numerous efforts, automatic processing of SAR data to derive accurate inundation maps still poses challenges. To address them, we have developed an NRT system named RAdarProduced Inundation Diary (RAPID). RAPID integrates four processing steps: classification based on statistics, morphological processing, multi-threshold-based compensation, and machine-leaming correction. Besides SAR data, the system integrates multisource remote-sensing data products, including land cover classification, water occurrence, hydrographical, water type, and river width products. In comparison to expert handmade flood maps, the fully-automated RAPID system exhibited "overall," "producer," and "user" accuracies of 93%, 77%, and 75%, respectively. RAPID accommodates commonly encountered over- and under-detections caused by noise-like speckle, water-like radar response areas, strong scatterers, and isolated inundation areas errors that are in common practice to ignore, mask out, or be filtered out by coarsening the effective resolution. RAPID can serve as the kernel algorithm to derive flood inundation products from satellites both existing and to be launched equipped with high-resolution SAR sensors, including Envisat, Radarsat, NISAR, Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS)-1/2, Sentinel-1, and TerraSAR-X.

AB Tracking the occurrence of deforestation events is an essential task in tropical dry forest (TDF) conservation efforts. Ideally, deforestation monitoring systems would identify a TDF clearing with near real time precision and high spatial detail, and alert park managers and environmental practitioners of illegal forest clearings occurring anywhere in a region of interest. Over the past several years there have been significant advances in the design and application of continuous land cover change mapping algorithms with these capabilities, but no studies have implemented such methods over human dominated TDF environments where small scale deforestation (< 5 ha) is widespread and hard to detect with moderate resolution sensors. The general objective for this research was to evaluate the overall accuracy of the BFASTSpatial R Package for detecting and monitoring small-scale deforestation in four sites located in tropical dry forest landscapes of Mexico and Costa Rica using greenness and moisture spectral indices derived from Landsat time series. Results show a high degree of spatial agreement (90%-94%) between the distribution of TDF clearings occurred during the 2013-2016 period (as indicated by VHR imagery interpretation) and BFASTSpatial outputs. NDMI and NBR2 had the best performance than other indices and this is evidenced by the combined overall, user's and producer's accuracies. In particular, NBR2 were the most accurate predictor of deforestation with an overall accuracy of 94.5%. Our results also imply that monitoring sites at an annual basis is feasible using BFASTSpatial and LTS, but that lower confidence should be given to sub-annual products given significant systematic temporal differences between the BFASTSpatial monthly product and reference data. The possibility of including more clear observations at the spatial resolution of Landsat (30-m) or higher will greatly increase the spatial and temporal accuracies of the method. Given its performance, BFASTSpatial can help monitor hotspots of small-scale TDF loss across Central and North America at little or no cost. Users of the method should have a strong knowledge of the local land use and land cover dynamics and the ecophysiology of vegetation types present in the landscape. This local expertise is necessary for interpreting and validating results as well as communicating its output to decision-makers and stakeholders.

AB With the unprecedented availability of satellite data and the rise of global binary maps, the collection of shared reference data sets should be fostered to allow systematic product benchmarking and validation. Authoritative global reference data are generally collected by experts with regional knowledge through photo-interpretation. During the last decade, crowdsourcing has emerged as an attractive alternative for rapid and relatively cheap data collection, beckoning the increasingly relevant question: can these two data sources be combined to validate thematic maps? In this article, we compared expert and crowd data and assessed their relative agreement for cropland identification, a land cover class often reported as difficult to map. Results indicate that observations from experts and volunteers could be partially conflated provided that several consistency checks are performed. We propose that conflation, i.e., replacement and augmentation of expert observations by crowdsourced observations, should be carried out both at the sampling and data analytics levels. The latter allows to evaluate the reliability of crowdsourced observations and to decide whether they should be conflated or discarded. We demonstrate that the standard deviation of crowdsourced contributions is a simple yet robust indicator of reliability which can effectively inform conflation. Following this criterion, we found that 70% of the expert observations could be crowdsourced with little to no effect on accuracy estimates, allowing a strategic reallocation of the spared expert effort to increase the reliability of the remaining 30% at no additional cost. Finally, we provide a collection of evidence-based recommendations for future hybrid reference data collection campaigns.

AB The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, like other heavily engineered deltas throughout the world, has undergone substantial subsidence since the late 1800s when the natural estuary was leveed to form islands. Today, islands within the Delta have subsided to the point where most lie below mean sea level. Long-term sustainability of the Delta requires reversal of subsidence, but spatially comprehensive maps of subsidence have not been available to inform and monitor remediation. Reported here is the first spatially dense map of recent subsidence rates across the Delta, based on synthetic aperture radar interferometry and constrained by GNSS observations. The analysis uses a temporally dense and spatially overlapping set of data acquired by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) sensor in 2009-2015. On average, the Delta is subsiding by 9.2 +/- 4.4 mm/yr with high variability even at the sub-island scale, including peak subsidence of 160 +/- 4.4 mm/yr occurring just inland of the levee of the westernmost island and average subsidence of 11 mm/yr along the planned path of water conveyance tunnels through the Delta. The results are compared to local sea level rise (SLR), measured at a tidal gauge in San Francisco Bay, to show that subsidence is currently the dominant contributor to local relative sea level rise (RSLR) by nearly a factor of five. Based on recently measured and modeled acceleration of SLR, subsidence in the Delta is likely to dominate RSLR until the middle of the 21th century.

AB The Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project is a NASA initiative aiming to produce a Virtual Constellation (VC) of surface reflectance (SR) data acquired by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing satellites, respectively. The HLS products are based on a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from both sensors (OLI and MSI): atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial co-registration and common gridding, bidirectional reflectance distribution function normalization and spectral bandpass adjustment. Three products are derived from the HLS processing chain: (i) S10: full resolution MSI SR at 10 m, 20 m and 60 m spatial resolutions; (ii) S30: a 30 in MSI Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR); (iii) L30: a 30 m OLI NBAR. All three products are processed for every Level-1 input products from Landsat 8/OLI (L1T) and Sentinel-2/MSI (L1C). As of version 1.3, the HLS data set covers 10.35 million km(2) and spans from first Landsat 8 data (2013); Sentinel-2 data spans from October 2015.
   The L30 and S30 show a good consistency with coarse spatial resolution products, in particular MODIS Collection 6 MCDO9CMG products (overall deviations do not exceed 11%) that are used as a reference for quality assurance. The spatial co-registration of the HLS is improved compared to original Landsat 8 MT and Sentinel 2A L1C products, for which misregistration issues between multi-temporal data are known. In particular, the resulting computed circular errors at 90% for the HLS product are 6.2 m and 18.8 m, for S10 and L30 products, respectively. The main known issue of the current data set remains the Sentinel-2 cloud mask with many cloud detection omissions. The cross-comparison with MODIS was used to flag products with most evident non-detected clouds. A time series outlier filtering approach is suggested to detect remaining clouds. Finally, several time series are presented to highlight the high potential of the HLS data set for crop monitoring.

AB This study proposes a two-component (surface and volume) C-band polarimetric decomposition to retrieve soil moisture over agricultural fields covered by different crop types. RADARSAT-2 data analysis shows that vegetation attenuation on the surface scattering component is stronger for the narrow-leaf (wheat) than broad-leaf crops (canola, corn and soybean). Thus, the vegetation attenuation factor is integrated into the proposed C-band polarimetric decomposition to better account for soil contribution over the whole crop phenological season. After removing the volume scattering component from the full coherency matrix, the surface scattering component was simulated by the Oh soil scattering model, instead of conventional Bragg or X-Bragg model, which is not physically valid at C-band due to limited roughness constraint condition. The proposed retrieval algorithm was applied to the RADARSAT-2 time series acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment in 2012 (SMAPVEX12). Results indicate that during the crop growth, the volume scattering power of wheat shows weak temporal variation, while it increases for corn, soybean and canola. The sensitivity of the ground scattering component to soil moisture is enhanced due to the removal of the volume scattering from the full signature. The retrieved soil moisture was validated using the soil moisture ground measurements during the SMAPVEX12. The validations indicate correlation coefficients from 0.63 to 0.76, and RMSEs from 0.058 to 0.074 m(3)/m(3) for the entire phenological period of SMAPVEX12 campaign. The negligible dihedral scattering component (1.6-9.2%) at C-band greatly reduces the complexity of the soil moisture retrieval from the ground component.

AB Understanding seasonal snow cover dynamics is critical for management of hydrological regimes, habitat availability for wildlife species, forest fire risk assessment and recreational demands. Although data products provided at 500 m spatial resolution by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor provide important and readily available information on snow cover, capturing snow dynamics at finer spatial resolutions remains problematic due to the lack of high temporal and spatial resolution data, which limits the number of available observations each year. In this paper we present a new approach to create a daily time-series of 30-m snow observations (called SNOWARP), derived from daily MODIS Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover data to capture the temporal dynamics of snow cover and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to re-order historical Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) observations to account for inter-annual variability. The SNOWARP product was produced for 2000-2018 for an area of Western Alberta (approximately 30,000 km(2)) and was calibrated against a network of time-lapse cameras and snow pillows. Results indicate the RMSE of the SNOWARP fractional product ranges from 31.3%-68.3%, while F score of the SNOWARP binary product ranges from 87.7% - 98.6% when compared to ground truth data. Capturing fractional snow cover at a fine spatial and temporal scale is important due to the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover, particularly in mountainous regions with implications for biodiversity assessment and monitoring. SNOWARP demonstrates a novel method to increasing the temporal resolution of Landsat-derived snow cover data, providing valuable insights on regional snow cover dynamics for use in a range of applications.

AB Much of the world's temperate grasslands have been converted to croplands, yet these trends can reverse in some regions. This is the case for the steppes of northern Kazakhstan, where the breakdown of the Soviet Union led to widespread cropland abandonment, creating restoration opportunities. Understanding when abandonment happened and whether it persists is important for making use of these opportunities. We developed a trajectory-based change detection approach to identify cropland abandonment between 1988 and 2013 and recultivation between 1991 and 2013. Our approach is based on annual time series of cropland probabilities derived from Landsat imagery and resulted in reliable maps (89% overall accuracy), with abandonment being detected more accurately (user's accuracy of 93%) than recultivation (73%). Most of the remaining uncertainty in our maps was due to low image availability during the mid-1990s, leading to abandonment in the 1990s sometimes only being detected in the 2000s. Our results suggest that of the similar to 4.7 million ha of cropland in our study area in 1985, roughly 40% had been abandoned by 2013. Knowing the timing of abandonment allowed for deeper insights into what drives these dynamics: recultivation after 2007 happened preferentially on those lands that had been abandoned most recently, suggesting that the most productive croplands were abandoned last and recultivated first. Likewise, knowing the timing of abandonment allowed for more precise estimates of the environmental impacts of abandonment (e.g., soil organic carbon sequestration estimated at 16.3 Mt. C compared to 24.0 Mt. C when assuming all abandonment happened right after the breakdown of the Soviet Union, with the uncertainty around emission estimates decreasing by 63%). Overall, our study emphasizes the value of the Landsat archive for understanding agricultural land-use dynamics, and the opportunities of trajectory-based approaches for mapping these dynamics.

AB We use the recently released Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) Version 4.1 (V4) lidar data to study the smoke plumes transported from Southern African biomass burning areas. Significant improvements in the CALIPSO V4 Level 1 calibration and V4 Level 2 algorithms lead to a better representation of their optical properties, with the aerosol subtype improvements being particularly relevant to smoke over this area. For the first time, we show evidence of smoke particles increasing in size, as demonstrated by their particulate color ratios, as they are transported over the South Atlantic Ocean from the source regions over Southern Africa. We hypothesize that this is due to hygroscopic swelling of the smoke particles and is reflected in the higher relative humidity in the middle troposphere for profiles with smoke. This finding may have implications for radiative forcing estimates over this area and is also relevant to the ORACLES field mission.

AB Satellite rainfall products have been available for many years (since '90) with an increasing spatial/temporal resolution and accuracy. Their global scale coverage and near real-time products perfectly fit the need of an early warning landslide system. Notwithstanding these characteristics, the number of studies employing satellite rainfall estimates for predicting landslide events is quite limited.
   In this study, we propose a procedure that allows us to evaluate the capability of different rainfall products to forecast the spatial -temporal occurrence of rainfall -induced landslides using rainfall thresholds. Specifically, the assessment is carried out in terms of skill scores, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The procedure is applied to ground observations and four different satellite rainfall estimates: 1) the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Multi -satellite Precipitation Analysis, TMPA, real time product (3642-RT), 2) the SM2RASC product obtained from the application of SM2RAIN algorithm to the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) derived satellite soil moisture (SM) data, 3) the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Network (PERSIANN), and 4) the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Morphing Technique (CMORPH). As case study, we consider the Italian territory for which a catalogue listing 1414 rainfall induced landslides in the period 2008-2014 is available.
   Results show that satellite products underestimate rainfall with respect to ground observations. However, by adjusting the rainfall thresholds, satellite products are able to identify landslide occurrence, even though with less accuracy than ground-based rainfall observations. Among the four satellite rainfall products, CMORPH and SM2RASC are performing the best, even though differences are small. This result is to be attributed to the high spatial/temporal resolution of CMORPH, and the good accuracy of SM2RSC. Overall, we believe that satellite rainfall estimates might be an important additional data source for developing continental or global landslide warning systems.

AB Snow cover is an informative indicator of climate change because it can affect local and regional surface energy and water balance, hydrological processes and climate, and ecosystem function. Passive microwave (PM) remote sensing data have long been used to retrieve snow depth and snow water equivalent with large uncertainties. The objective of this study is to develop snow-depth retrieval algorithm based on support vector regression (SVR) technique using PM remote sensing data and other auxiliary data. Ground-based daily snow depth data from 1223 stations across Eurasian continent were used to construct and validate the snow-depth retrieval algorithm. This SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm partitioned three snow cover stages, and four land cover types then generated twelve snow-depth models for each phases. A non-linear regression method based on support vector regression (SVR) was used to retrieve snow depth with PM brightness temperatures, location (latitude and longitude), and terrain parameters (elevation) as input data and land cover as auxiliary data. In addition, we compared the performance of the SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm with four alternative algorithms: the Chang algorithm, the Spectral Polarization Difference (SPD) algorithm, the Artificial/Neural Networks (ANN) and, an algorithm based on linear regression. Comparing results obtained from these five snow-depth retrieval algorithms against the ground-based daily snow depth data, the SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm performs much superior with reduced uncertainties. We report the results aimed at evaluating the impact of the variation of snow cover stages and land cover types. The preliminary results suggest that the SVR snow-depth algorithm could detect deep snow with high accuracy and decrease the impact of saturation effects. These results suggest that the SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm integrating PM remote sensing data and other auxiliary data (land cover types, location, terrain, snow cover stage with indirectly considering grain size variation) can be a more efficient and effective algorithm for retrieving snow depth and snow water equivalent over various scales.

AB Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has become an essential tool for measuring ice sheet velocity in the Polar Regions. At low radar frequencies, e.g. L-band (1.2 GHz) but also at higher frequency, e.g. C-band (5.6 GHz), the ionosphere has been documented to be an important source of noise in these data. In this paper, we employ a split-spectrum technique and investigate its performance for correcting ionospheric effects in InSAR-based ice velocity measurements in Greenland and Antarctica. Three case studies using ALOS PALSAR data are used to assess the performance of the split spectrum technique for ionosphere correction over a range of environmental parameters. We employ several approaches to evaluate the results, including visual inspection, profile analysis, comparison of experimental and theoretic errors, comparison with reference data from other sources, generation of double difference interferograms, and analysis of time series of multi-temporal data. Our experiments show that ionospheric distortions are observed regularly, and in our analyzed Greenland dataset and Antarctic dataset the ionospheric noise reaches 14 m/yr and 10 m/yr, respectively, which exceeds the signal associated with ice motion. Our analysis using several different approaches demonstrates that the split-spectrum technique provides an effective correction. The split spectrum technique is also found to be superior to currently used approaches such as baseline fitting and multi-temporal averaging. The noise level is reduced by a factor of 70% in Greenland test areas and 90% in Antarctic test areas.

AB Despite post-processing efforts by space agencies and research institutions, contemporary global digital elevation models (DEMs) may contain artefacts, i.e., erroneous features that do not exist in the actual terrain, such as spikes, holes and line errors. The goal of the present paper is to illuminate the artefact issue of current global DEM data sets that might be an obstacle for any geoscience study using terrain information. We introduce the Maximum Slope Approach (MSA) as a technique that uses terrain slopes as indicator to detect and localize spurious artefacts. The MSA relies on the strong sensitivity of terrain slopes for sudden steps in the DEM that is a direct feature of larger artefacts. In a numerical case study, the MSA is applied for globally complete screening of two SRTM-based 3 arc-second DEMs, the SRTM v4.1 and the MERIT-DEM. Based on 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees sub-divisions and a 5 m/m slope threshold, 1341 artefacts were detected in SRTM v4.1 vs. 108 in MERIT. Most artefacts spatially correlate with SRTM voids (and thus with the void-filling) and not with the SRTM-measured elevations. The strong contrast in artefact frequency (factor similar to 12) is attributed to the SRTM v4.1 hole filling. Our study shows that over parts of the Himalaya Mountains the SRTM v4.1 data set is contaminated by step artefacts where the use of this DEM cannot be recommended. Some caution should be exercised, e.g., over parts of the Andes and Rocky Mountains. The same holds true for derived global products that depend on SRTM v4.1, such as gravity maps. Primarily over the major mountain ranges, the MERIT model contains artefacts, too, but in smaller numbers. As a conclusion, globally complete artefact screening is recommended prior to the public release of any DEM data set. However, such a quality check should also be considered by users before using DEM data. MSA-based artefact screening is not only limited to DEMs, but can be applied as quality assurance measure to other gridded data sets such as digital bathymetric models or gridded physical quantities such as gravity or magnetics.

AB The disturbance and recovery cycles of Canadian boreal forests result in highly dynamic landscapes, requiring continued monitoring to observe and characterize environmental change over time. Well-established remote sensing methods capture change over forested ecosystems, however the return of forest vegetation in disturbed locations is infrequently documented and not well understood. Landsat time-series data allows for both the capture of the initial disturbance and the ability to monitor the subsequent vegetation regeneration with spectral vegetation indices. In this research, we used three spectral recovery metrics derived from an annual Landsatbased per-pixel Normalized Burn Ratio time series to determine trends in the short-term rates of spectral recovery for areas disturbed by wildfire (1986-2006), as assessed using a series of 5-year post-disturbance windows to observe forest recovery trends. Our results indicated that rates of spectral forest recovery vary over time and space in the Taiga and Boreal Shield ecozones. We found evidence that post-fire spectral forest recovery rates have accelerated over time in both the East and West Taiga Shield ecozones, with a consistent, positive, and significant trend measured using a Mann-Kendall test for monotonicity and Theil-Sen slope estimation. Over the analysis period (1986-2011), relative rates of spectral forest recovery increased by 18% in the Taiga Shield East and 9% in the Taiga Shield West. In contrast, spectral forest recovery rates in the Boreal Shield varied temporally, and were not consistently positive or negative. These results demonstrate that post-fire spectral recovery rates are not fixed over time and that spectral trends are dependent upon spatial location in the Canadian boreal. This retrospective baseline information on trends in spectral recovery rates highlights the value of, and continued need for detailed monitoring of vegetation regeneration in boreal forest ecosystems, particularly in the context of a changing climate.

AB Intensification of cattle ranching has the potential to reduce deforestation rates in the Brazilian Amazon by decreasing the demand for new agricultural land. Explicit spatial knowledge on where, when and how pastures are managed and intensification takes place is needed to better estimate potentials of more sustainable management. Monitoring the frequency of management practices like burning of pasture land and tillage treatment with adequate spatial resolution therefore offers novel indicators for describing land use intensity. With dense time series of Landsat data, it appears possible to quantify land use intensity also in heterogeneous landscapes where fine-scale processes cannot be monitored with previously available datasets.
   Our overarching goal is to describe the occurrence or absence of extensive or intensive management regimes over time. For this study, we focused on detecting fire and tillage events in the region of Novo Progresso, Para, Brazil, where deforested land is mostly used for cattle ranching by both largeholders and smallholders. We used a dense time series of Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 surface reflectance data to mitigate the problem of varying cloud cover. For each acquisition date, we extracted a temporal sequence of three subsequent clear observations at pixel level. The temporal variation in each clear observation sequence was characterized by a stack of spectral and temporal features. These feature stacks were classified with a random forest to identify the management events. We aggregated the classification results based on the random forest class probabilities and derived normalized annual class scores for land management events. The yielded class score maps show burned and tilled areas on a yearly basis and provide a measure of model confidence.
   We detected burned pastures with area adjusted user accuracies of 80-98%, burned secondary regrowth with 63-80% and tilled pastures with 74-78%. Our approach was able to discriminate management events even when they succeeded very fast. This way, the mapping approach with clear observation sequences allows us to contextualize management events directly from dense time series of high resolution satellite data. This opens new pathways to disentangle how management practices between smallholders and agribusinesses vary in the Brazilian Amazon. With sensor constellations from Sentinel-2 and Landsat data becoming a unified source for much denser time series soon, our method bears great potential to better understand and map pasture dynamics in the Amazon.

AB Effective and accurate monitoring of grassland above-ground biomass (AGB) is important for pastoral agriculture planning and management. In this study, we combined 1433 AGB field measurements and remotely sensed data with the goal of establishing a suitable model for estimating grassland AGB in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) of China, which is one of the most sensitive regions to the warming climate. A back-propagation artificial neural network (BP ANN) was used to select the variables that contribute the most to the model's estimation of AGB, and then we built the model. Out of 13 variables, 5 variables were selected to build the BP ANN model, and we used cross validation for the accuracy assessment. The results show that: (1) the modeled mean AGB (2001-2016) provides a reasonable spatial distribution that is similar to the field measurements but reveals more details and has better spatial coverage than the limited field measurements are able to provide; (2) the overall trend of AGB in the TRHR is increasing more than decreasing (44.4% vs 29.2%, respectively) and has a stable area of 26.4%; and (3) the BP ANN model achieves better results than do the traditional multi-factor regression models (R-2 : 0.75-0.85 vs 0.40-0.64, RMSE: 355-462 vs 537-689 kg DW/ha). This study presents an effective and operational BP ANN model that estimates grassland AGB for the study area with high accuracy at 500 m spatial resolution, providing a scientific basis for the determination of reasonable stocking capacity and possible future development.

AB Interferometric processing of series of data acquired over time by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites makes it possible to measure millimetric deformations (typically due to landslides, subsidence and earthquake or volcanic phenomena) and to monitor the stability of terrain and infrastructures. Despite the unique capability to observe very large areas, this technology has been typically applied to the analysis of relatively small sites or specific geophysical phenomena. In this work, we present the first application of this technology to a national scale project, which required the processing, through advanced persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) techniques, of about 20,000 SAR images acquired from 1992 to 2014 over the whole Italian territory by the ERS, Envisat, and COSMO-SkyMed satellites. The obtained results provide a huge database of surface deformation measurements covering the last 20 years and the whole Italian territory, which represents an extremely useful and pioneering service for geo-hazards mapping and prevention.

AB Remote sensing-based field-scale evapotranspiration (ET) maps are useful for characterizing water use patterns and assessing crop performance. The relative impact of climate variability and water management decisions are better studied and quantified using historical data that are derived using a set of consistent datasets and methodology. Historical (1984-2014) Landsat-based ET maps were generated for major irrigation districts in California, i.e., Palo Verde and eight other sub-basins in parts of the middle and lower Central Valley. A total of 3396 Landsat images were processed using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model that integrates weather and remotely sensed images to estimate monthly and annual ET within the study sites over the 31 years. Model output evaluation and validation using gridded-flux data and water balance ET approaches indicated relatively good correspondence (R-2 up to 0.88, root mean square error as low as 14 mm/month) between SSEBop ET and validation datasets. In a pairwise comparison, annual variability of agro-hydrologic parameters of actual evapotranspiration (ETa), land surface temperature (T-s), and runoff (Q) were found to be more variable than their corresponding climatic counterparts of atmospheric water demand (ETo), air temperature (T-a), and precipitation (P), revealing process differences between regional climatic drivers and localized agro-hydrologic responses. However, only To showed a consistent increase (up to 1.2 K) over study sites during the 31 years, whereas other climate variables such as ET, and P showed a generally neutral trend. This study demonstrates a useful application of "Big Data" science where large volumes of historical Landsat and weather datasets were used to quantify and understand the relative importance of water management and climate variability in crop water use dynamics in regards to the linkages among water management decisions, hydrologic processes and economic transactions. Irrigation district-wide ET estimates were used to compute historical crop water use volumes and monetary equivalents of water savings for the Palo Verde Irrigation District (PVID). During the peak crop fallowing year in PVID, the water saved reached a maximum of similar to 107,200 acre-feet in 2011 with an estimated monetary payout value of $20.5 million. A significant decreasing trend in actual ET despite an increasing atmospheric demand in PVID highlights the role of management decisions in affecting local hydrologic processes. This study has importance for planning water resource allocation, managing water rights, sustaining agricultural production, and quantifying impacts of climate and land use/land cover changes on water resources. With increased computational efficiency, similar studies can be conducted in other parts of the world to help policy and decision makers understand and quantify various aspects of water resources management.

AB Floodplains delay the transport of water, dissolved matter and sediments by storing water during flood peak seasons. Estimation of water storage over the floodplains is essential to understand the water balances in the fluvial systems and the role of floodplains in nutrient and sediment transport. However, spatio-temporal variations of water storages over floodplains are not well known due to their remoteness, vastness, and high temporal variability. In this study, we propose a new method to estimate absolute water storages over the floodplains by establishing relations between water depths (d) and water volumes (V) using 2-D water depth maps from the integration of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and altimetry measurements. We applied this method over the Congo River floodplains and modeled the d V relation using a power function (note that d V indicates relation between d and V, not d minus V), which revealed the cross-section geometry of the floodplains as a convex curve. Then, we combined this d V relation and Envisat altimetry measurements to construct time series of floodplain's absolute water storages from 2002 to 2011. Its mean annual amplitude over the floodplains ( 7,777 km(2)) is 3.86 0.59 km(3) with peaks in December, which lags behind total water storage (TWS) changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and precipitation changes from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) by about one month. The results also exhibit inter-annual variability, with maximum water volume to be 5.9 0.72 km(3) in the wet year of 2002 and minimum volume to be 2.01 0.63 km(3) in the dry year of 2005. The inter-annual variation of water storages can be explained by the changes of precipitation from TRMM.

AB Synergy of satellite observations in the visible infrared and microwave spectral bands presents an attractive and powerful approach to improve monitoring of the Earth's snow and ice cover. This approach is implemented in the Global Multisensor Automated Snow and Ice Mapping System (GMASI) operated by NOAA NESDIS since 2006. Combined observations in the visible and infrared from the AVHRR sensor onboard METOP satellites and in the microwave spectral bands from SSMIS onboard DMSP satellites allows for providing spatially continuous characterization of the snow and ice distribution on a daily basis. The paper presents a basic description of techniques and algorithms implemented in the system and examines the system performance in the course of the last ten years. It is demonstrated that the GMASI product adequately reproduces spatial patterns of the snow and ice distribution and their seasonal variations. Validation of GMASI daily snow retrievals over the Northern Hemisphere has demonstrated their close correspondence to surface observations of the snow cover with the yearly mean rate of over 94%. Automated maps are found to agree even better to the daily snow and ice cover map produced interactively at NOAA. In this latter case the agreement rates on the snow cover and ice cover distribution amounted correspondingly to 96% and 98%. A larger part of mismatches was due to underestimated snow and ice extent in the automated maps as compared to in situ data and interactive analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Multiple-aperture SAR interferometry (MAI) is an advanced technique that is used to retrieve actual surface motions by complementing missing components of InSAR measurements. Despite the wide use of the MAI method in the geosciences, X-band SAR has rarely been applied in MAI-based studies due to the relatively shorter decorrelation periods involved. Thus, we need to evaluate the MAI measurements from X-band SAR for the use in the geosciences. In this paper, an assessment of the MAI performance for TerraSAR-X system was carried out at the test site, Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, focusing on the Kamoamoa fissure eruption episode that occurred on March 6-10, 2011. The root-mean-square (RMS) errors of single MAI interferograms were 3.26 +/- 1.32 cm and 2.95 +/- 0.77 cm for descending and ascending datasets, respectively. Multi-stacked MAI interferograms showed reduced error levels of 1.77 and 2.04 cm for descending and ascending datasets, respectively. In addition, empirical uncertainty models of the MAI measurements were generated with respect to the interferometric coherence of single-and multi-stacked MAI measurements, and these regression models enabled us to confirm the difference between the theoretical and practical accuracies of the MAI measurements. Moreover, the MAI-based 3D model based on high accuracy 3D maps showed some possibilities of new findings and interpretations of the geologic sources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents for the first time a demonstration with satellite data of polarimetric SAR interferometry (PolInSAR) applied to the retrieval of vegetation height in rice fields. Three series of dual-pol interferometric SAR data acquired with large baselines (2-3 km) by the TanDEM-X system during its science phase (April September 2015) are exploited. A novel inversion algorithm especially suited for rice fields cultivated in flooded soil is proposed and evaluated. The validation is carried out over three test sites located in geographically different areas: Sevilla (SW Spain), Valencia (E Spain), and Ipsala (W Turkey), in which different rice types are present. Results are obtained during the whole growth cycle and demonstrate that PolInSAR is useful to produce accurate height estimates (RMSE 10-20 cm) when plants are tall enough (taller than 25-40 cm), without relying on external reference information.

AB Two passive microwave missions are currently operating at L-band to monitor surface soil moisture (SM) over continental surfaces. The SMOS sensor, based on an innovative interferometric technology enabling multi-angular signatures of surfaces to be measured, was launched in November 2009. The SMAP sensor, based on a large mesh reflector 6 m in diameter providing a conically scanning antenna beam with a surface incidence angle of 40, was launched in January of 2015. Over the last decade, an intense scientific activity has focused on the development of the SM retrieval algorithms for the two missions. This activity has relied on many field (mainly tower-based) and airborne experimental campaigns, and since 2010-2011, on the SMOS and Aquarius space-borne L-band observations. It has relied too on the use of numerical, physical and semi-empirical models to simulate the microwave brightness temperature of natural scenes for a variety of scenarios in terms of system configurations (polarization, incidence angle) and soil, vegetation and climate conditions. Key components of the inversion models have been evaluated and new parameterizations of the effects of the surface temperature, soil roughness, soil permittivity, and vegetation extinction and scattering have been developed. Among others, global maps of select radiative transfer parameters have been estimated very recently. Based on this intense activity, improvements of the SMOS and SMAP SM inversion algorithms have been proposed. Some of them have already been implemented, whereas others are currently being investigated. In this paper, we present a review of the significant progress which has been made over the last decade in this field of research with a focus on L-band, and a discussion on possible applications to the SMOS and SMAP soil moisture retrieval approaches.

AB Recent advancements in remote sensing technology, specifically Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, provide the data needed to quantify forest characteristics at a fine spatial resolution over large geographic domains. From an inferential standpoint, there is interest in prediction and interpolation of the often sparsely sampled and spatially misaligned LiDAR signals and forest variables. We propose a fully process-based Bayesian hierarchical model for above ground biomass (AGB) and LiDAR signals. The process based framework offers richness in inferential capabilities, e.g., inference on the entire underlying processes instead of estimates only at pre-specified points. Key challenges we obviate include misalignment between the AGB observations and LiDAR signals and the high-dimensionality in the model emerging from LiDAR signals in conjunction with the large number of spatial locations. We offer simulation experiments to evaluate our proposed models and also apply them to a challenging dataset comprising LiDAR and spatially coinciding forest inventory variables collected on the Penobscot Experimental Forest (PEF), Maine. Our key substantive contributions include AGB data products with associated measures of uncertainty for the PEF and, more broadly, a methodology that should find use in a variety of current and upcoming forest variable mapping efforts using sparsely sampled remotely sensed high-dimensional data.

AB This study evaluates the large-scale seasonal phenology and physiology of vegetation over northern high latitude forests (40 degrees-55 degrees N) during spring and fall by using remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and observation-based estimate of gross primary productivity (GPP) from 2009 to 2011. Based on GPP phenology estimation in GPP, the growing season determined by SIF time-series is shorter in length than the growing season length determined solely using NDVI. This is mainly due to the extended period of high NDVI values, as compared to SIF, by about 46 days (+/- 11 days), indicating a large-scale seasonal decoupling of physiological activity and changes in greenness in the fall. In addition to phenological timing, mean seasonal NDVI and SIF have different responses to temperature changes throughout the growing season. We observed that both NDVI and SIF linearly increased with temperature increases throughout the spring. However, in the fall, although NDVI linearly responded to temperature increases, SIF and GPP did not linearly increase with temperature increases, implying a seasonal hysteresis of SIF and GPP in response to temperature changes across boreal ecosystems throughout their growing season. Seasonal hysteresis of vegetation at large-scales is consistent with the known phenomena that light limits boreal forest ecosystem productivity in the fall. Our results suggest that continuing measurements from satellite remote sensing of both SIF and NDVI can help to understand the differences between, and information carried by, seasonal variations vegetation structure and greenness and physiology at large-scales across the critical boreal regions.

AB As a non-Annex 1 Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Tanzania has committed to submit the results of the measurement, reporting, and verification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions and removals by sinks under the Biennial Update Reports of national GHG inventory and mitigation actions. Thus, implementation of a robust and cost-efficient carbon accounting system is one of the prerequisites for receiving financial benefits under the REDD + mechanism. For estimation targeting large areas (i.e., country, region, and sub-regional), remote sensing techniques like airborne laser scanning (ALS) enable precise and timely estimation of biomass stocks and biomass changes. The main objective of the study was to compare alternative sampling strategies using ALS for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) changes in miombo woodlands that would be suitable components of the National Forestry Resources Monitoring and Assessment (NAFORMA) program of Tanzania and of the Biennial Update Reports under UNFCCC. NAFORMA is the national forest inventory of Tanzania. The study area of 15,867 km(2) was located in the administrative district of Liwale, south-eastern Tanzania and dominated by miombo woodlands. A longitudinal survey was carried out during two temporally consistent field and ALS data acquisition campaigns in 2012 and 2014. The field data were collected on permanent plots of the NAFORMA program. ALS measurements were acquired along 32 parallel strips spaced 5 km apart and covering approximately 25% of the study area. Estimation methods (1) solely based on the ground inventory data provided by NAFORMA and (2) by incorporating field observations and auxiliary variables derived from ALS data were pursued for assessing AGB change as the difference between estimated AGB in 2012 and 2014, together with the uncertainties related to sampling variability. The AGB estimates varied from 58.48 to 59.55 Mg ha(-1) in 2012 and between 58.20 and 59.29 Mg ha(-1) in 2014. The sampling variability (in terms of standard errors) was between 137 and 4.79 Mg ha(-1) in 2012, and 1.77 and 5.03 Mg ha(-1) in 2014. The mean AGB change varied from 0.11 to 0.35 Mg ha(-1) with standard errors of 0.31 to 0.85 Mg ha(-1). Compared to direct estimation based on field data only, the efficiency gain under ALS-assisted (design-based, model-assisted) estimation was 5-22%, and approximately 66% when using ALS data in a model-dependent estimation. The results provide statistically significant evidence of change in AGB over the 2-yr period spanned by the study only under model-dependent estimation at 50% confidence level, illustrating the great challenges of change estimation over such short time periods as requested for UNFCCC reporting.

AB This paper presents an operational chain for high-resolution leaf area index (LAI) retrieval from multiresolution satellite data specifically developed for Mediterranean rice areas. The proposed methodology is based on the inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model through the state-of-the-art nonlinear Gaussian process regression (GPR) method. Landsat and SPOT5 data were used for multitemporal LAI retrievals at high-resolution. LAI estimates were validated using time series of in situ LAI measurements collected during the rice season in Spain and Italy. Ground LAI data were collected with smartphones using PocketLAI, a specific phone application for LAI estimation. Temporal evolution of the LAI estimates using Landsat and SPOT5 data followed consistently the temporal evolution of the in situ LAI measurements acquired on several Mediterranean rice varieties. The estimates had a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.39 and 0.51 m(2)/m(2) in Spain and 0.38 and 0.47 m(2)/m(2) in Italy for Landsat and SPOT5 respectively, with a strong correlation (R-2 > 0.92) for both cases. Spatial-temporal assessment of the estimated LAI from Landsat and SPOT5 data confirmed the robustness and consistency of the retrieval chain. This paper demonstrates the importance of an adequate characterization of the underlying rice background in order to address changes in background condition related to water management. Results highlight the potential of the proposed chain for deriving multitemporal near real-time decametric LAI maps fundamental for operational rice crop monitoring, and demonstrate the readiness of the proposed method for the processing of data such as the recently launched Sentinel-2.

AB Forests play important roles in the Earth's climate system and global carbon cycle. Therefore, a critical need exists to improve our understanding of how the growing seasons of forests are changing, and by extension, how the composition and function of forests will respond to future climate change. Coarse spatial resolution satellite remote sensing has been widely used to monitor and map the phenology of terrestrial ecosystems at regional to global scales, and despite widespread agreement that the growing season of Northern Hemisphere forests is changing, the spatial resolution of these data sources imposes significant limitations on the character and quality of inferences that can be drawn from them. In particular, the spatial resolution afforded by instruments such as MODIS does not resolve ecologically important landscape-scale patterns in phenology. With this issue in mind, here we evaluate the ability of a newly developed Landsat phenology algorithm (LPA) to reconstruct a 32-year time series for the start and end of the growing season in North American temperate and boreal forests. We focus on 13 "sidelap" regions located between overlapping Landsat scenes that span a large geographic range of temperate and boreal forests, and evaluate the quality and character of LPA-derived-start and end of growing season (SOS and EOS) dates using several independent data sources. On average, SOS and EOS dates were detected for about two-thirds of the 32 years included in our analysis, with the remaining one-third missing due to cloud cover. Moreover, there was generally better agreement between ground observations and LPA-derived estimates of SOS dates than for EOS across the 13 sites included in our study. Our results demonstrate that, despite the presence of time series gaps, LPA provides a robust basis for retrospective analysis of long-term changes in spring and autumn deciduous forest phenology over the last three decades. Finally, our results support the potential for monitoring land surface phenology at 30 m spatial resolution in near real-time by combining time series from multiple sensors such as the Landsat Operational Land Imager and the Sentinel 2 MultiSpectral Instrument.

AB Wetlands are highly dynamic ecosystem components that fluctuate dramatically in inundation and persistence of water both within and across years. However, these systems are commonly classified in a deterministic, discrete manner that does not reflect inherent spatial and temporal variation. Developing a methodology to identify gradients in water inundation is critical given the dynamic nature of wetlands. We present a methodology that applies probabilistic estimates, derived from a nonparametric model, to predict wetlands along a gradient in ephemerality, or degree of water inundation. We applied this model across four sampling areas in the Plains and Prairie Pothole Region (PPPR) in the U.S. Northern Great Plains. We developed a model relationship between high-resolution (RapidEye) and moderate resolution (Landsat) satellite sensor data. This allowed us leverage the benefits of high spatial resolution data and a long temporal series of freely available mid-resolution data to characterize water persistence in wetlands. To obtain measures of wetland inundation across a gradient of ephemerality, we estimated wetland probabilities across a temporal series reflecting large variation in moisture conditions. We found that a nonparametric statistical approach was highly effective in predicting wetlands of varying size and ephemerality. Our predictions were strongly supported with low error (RapidEye 3.1-15%, Landsat 0.3-1.5%). Probabilistic predictions of wetland ephemerality contribute valuable information needed for management and policy decisions, especially given potential alterations to wetland ephemerality and ecosystem services under climate change. Using predicted gradients in wetland ephemerality over time will enable researchers and land managers to more effectively capture nuance in ecosystem condition, function, and change.

AB Covering 40% of the terrestrial surface, dryland ecosystems characteristically have distinct vegetation structures that are strongly linked to their function. Existing survey approaches cannot provide sufficiently fine-resolution data at landscape-level extents to quantify this structure appropriately. Using a small, unpiloted aerial system (UAS) to acquire aerial photographs and processing theses using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry, three-dimensional models were produced describing the vegetation structure of semi-arid ecosystems at seven sites across a grass-to shrub transition zone. This approach yielded ultra-fine (<1 cm(2)) spatial resolution canopy height models over landscape-levels (10 ha), which resolved individual grass tussocks just a few cm(3) in volume. Canopy height cumulative distributions for each site illustrated ecologically-significant differences in ecosystem structure. Strong coefficients of determination (r(2) from 0.64 to 0.95) supported prediction of above-ground biomass from canopy volume. Canopy volumes, above-ground biomass and carbon stocks were shown to be sensitive to spatial changes in the structure of vegetation communities. The grain of data produced and sensitivity of this approach is invaluable to capture even subtle differences in the structure (and therefore function) of these heterogeneous ecosystems subject to rapid environmental change. The results demonstrate how products from inexpensive UAS coupled with SfM photogrammetry can produce ultra-fine grain biophysical data products, which have the potential to revolutionise scientific understanding of ecology in ecosystems with either spatially or temporally discontinuous canopy cover.

AB Peatland net ecosystem production is a key variable to assess changes in the functional role of peatlands in the global carbon cycle. Light use efficiency (LUE) models in combination with satellite data have been used to estimate production for most major ecosystems, but peatlands have been largely ignored. The objectives of this study were: 1) to examine how the LUE parameter epsilon, epsilon (the amount of carbon fixed or converted to biomass per unit absorbed photosynthetically active radiation), varies between and within four different peatlands; 2) to examine how the variations in epsilon relate to variations in environmental conditions; and 3) to evaluate a LUE-based model for estimation of epsilon in peatlands. We achieve these objectives using a combination of eddy covariance flux measurements, climate data and satellite data and estimate epsilon using the LUE-based vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM). The results show that: 1) mean site-specific flux-derived epsilon values (+/- standard deviation) were split into three statistically different groups: lowest values at the two colder fens, Kaamanen and Sandhill (0.22 +/- 0.18 and 0.23 +/- 0.20 g C MJ(-1), respectively), highest values at the treed fen La Biche (0.47 +/- 0.27 g C MJ(-1)) and intermediate values at the bog, Mer Bleue (0.34 +/- 0.18 g C MJ(-1)); 2) Variations in monthly epsilon within sites related mainly to air temperature, while variations in annual epsilon within sites related mainly to wetness variables; 3) relative mean absolute errors of estimates of s for the four sites ranged between 19% and 35%, with r(2) values ranging between 72% and 93%. LUE models are appealing as they are relatively simple formulations of variables that are easily obtained from satellite data. Challenges associated with the use of satellite data derived input variables are further discussed in the paper. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Smallholder farms dominate in many parts of the world, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa. These systems are characterized by small, heterogeneous, and often indistinct field patterns, requiring a specialized methodology to map agricultural land cover. Using a variety of sites in South Africa, we present a new approach to mapping agricultural fields, based on efficient extraction of a vast set of simple, highly correlated, and interdependent features, followed by a random forest classifier. We achieved similar high performance across agricultural types, including the spectrally indistinct smallholder fields as well as the more easily distinguishable commercial fields, and demonstrated the ability to generalize performance across large geographic areas. In sensitivity analyses, we determined multi-temporal information provided greater gains in performance than the addition of multi-spectral bands available in DigitalGlobe Worldview-2 imagery.

AB Knowledge of LiDAR measurement uncertainty and its propagation into derived geospatial products is important for conscientious application of LiDAR products to environmental modeling, planning and decision making. This study simulates theoretical error limits of LiDAR elevations based on survey acquisition parameters and terrain conditions and applies a Monte Carlo simulation approach to determine the uncertainty in a DEM, grid based slope and aspect maps, watershed area and a stream network delineation. A cell-by-cell assessment of the DEM for hydrological network extraction is also provided through the Gyasi-Agyei et al. (1995) suitability metric. Results show that DEM uncertainty generally ranged between 0.025 and 0.060 m, slope uncertainty ranged between 0.6 and 1.5 degrees, and aspect uncertainty ranged between 2.7 and 24.1 degrees for the given case study site. DEM uncertainty and slope uncertainty were correlated with the incidence angle between the laser pulse and the terrain, described with a piecewise linear function. Uncertainty in aspect showed a correlation with terrain slope and could be described with a decreasing power function. The variation in watershed area was less than 1% of total watershed area indicating it was not sensitive to LiDAR measurement errors for the selected case study site. Stream network length variability was 1.5% of total length, but increased as the analyzed area decreased. Areas of 1 ha showed relative standard deviations of stream network length of similar to 26%. These results can be used to optimise LiDAR survey data collection configuration and in the design of tools to ensure the objectives and uncertainty requirements of projects requiring terrain derivative products are successfully achieved.

AB An algorithm for cloud removal in visible bands was developed. Thin clouds inside visible Bands 1-4 of Landsat-8 data acquired on 8 January 2014 disappeared after the algorithm. Values of mean and one standard deviation decreased, band-by-band. The reduction was supported by the leftward shift of the histogram curve in each band. To validate the algorithm, we used the cloud-free image acquired on 23 December 2013 of Landsat-8 as the reference image. Among the January image before the algorithm, the January image after the algorithm, and the reference image, values of mean and one standard deviation of the January image after the algorithm were much closer to those of the reference image. Histogram curves of the January image after the algorithm and the reference image were almost overlapped entirely. Spatial correlation coefficients of the January image before the algorithm and reference were 0.496, 0.547, 0.656, and 0.730 for Bands 1-4, respectively. Coefficients of the January image after the algorithm and reference image became 0.782, 0.822, 0.840, and 0.885 for Bands 1-4. In cloud-free areas, the algorithm did not alter spectral characteristics of cloud-free pixels. Thus, the algorithm was not only able to remove thin clouds, but also to preserve spectral characteristics of cloud-free pixels. The algorithm was then applied to other land use and land cover (LULC) types, and images acquired in other locations and seasons by Landsat-8 and WorldView-2 sensors. Results in cloud removal were satisfactory. Finally, this algorithm outperformed three widely-used cloud removal algorithms in comparison. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Drought is a major cause of limited agricultural productivity and of crop yield uncertainty throughout the world. For that reason, agricultural drought research and monitoring are of increasing interest. Although soil moisture is the main variable to define and identify agricultural drought, the actual soil water content is rarely taken into account because this type of drought is commonly studied using methodologies based on either climatological data or hydrological modeling. Currently, it is possible to use remote sensing to obtain global and frequent soil moisture data that could be directly used for agricultural drought monitoring everywhere. For example, the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite was launched in 2009 and provides global soil moisture maps every 1-2 days. In this work, the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) was calculated using the SMOS 12 soil moisture series in the REMEDHUS (Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network) area (Spain) during the period 2010-2014. The satellite index was thus calculated using several approaches to obtain the soil water parameters and was compared with the SWDI obtained from in situ data. One approach was based directly on SMOS soil moisture time series (using the 5th percentile as an estimator for wilting point and the 95th percentile and the minimum of the maximum value during the growing season as estimators for field capacity). In this case, the results of the comparison were good, but the temporal distribution and the range of the index data were unrealistic. Other approaches were based on in situ data parameters and pedotransfer functions estimation. In this case, the results were better, and the satellite index was able to adequately identify the drought dynamics. Therefore, the final choice to apply the index in one particular site will depend on the availability of data. Finally, a comparison analysis was made with the SMOS SWDI and two indices (Crop Moisture Index, CMI, and Atmospheric Water Deficit, AWD) commonly used for agricultural drought monitoring and assessment. In both cases, the agreement was very good, and it was proven that SMOS SWDI reproduces well the soil water balance dynamics and is able to appropriately track agricultural drought.

AB Plant phenology plays a significant role in regulating carbon sequestration period of terrestrial ecosystems. Remote sensing of land surface phenology (LSP), i.e., the start and the end of the growing season (SOS and EOS, respectively) in evergreen needleleaf forests is particularly challenging due to their limited seasonal variability in canopy greenness. Using 107 site-years of CO2 flux data at 14 evergreen needleleaf forest sites in North America, we developed a new model to estimate SOS and EOS based entirely on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We found that the commonly used vegetation indices (VI), including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), were not able to detect SOS and EOS in these forests. The MODIS land surface temperature (LST) showed better performance in the estimation of SOS than did a single VI. Interestingly, the variability of LST (i.e., the coefficient of variation, CV LST) was more useful than LST itself in detecting changes in forest LSP. Therefore, a new model using the product of VI and CV LST was developed and it significantly improved the representation of LSP with mean errors of 11.7 and 5.6 days for SOS and EOS, respectively. Further validation at five sites in the Long Term Ecological Research network (LTER) using camera data also indicated the applicability of the new approach. These results suggest that temperature variability plays a previously overlooked role in phenological modeling, and a combination of canopy greenness and temperature could be a useful way to enhance the estimation of evergreen needleleaf forest phenology of future ecosystem models.

AB Forest inventory and monitoring programs are needed to provide timely, spatially complete (i.e. mapped), and verifiable information to support forest management, policy formulation, and reporting obligations. Satellite images, in particular data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM +) sensors, are often integrated with field plots from forest inventory programs, leveraging the complete spatial coverage of imagery with detailed ecological information from a sample of plots to spatially model forest conditions and resources. However, in remote and unmanaged areas such as Canada's northern forests, financial and logistic constraints can severely limit the availability of inventory plot data. Additionally, Landsat spectral information has known limitations for characterizing vertical vegetation structure and biomass; while clouds, snow, and short growing seasons can limit development of large area image mosaics that are spectrally and phenologically consistent across space and time. In this study we predict and map forest structure and aboveground biomass over 37 million ha of forestland in Saskatchewan, Canada. We utilize lidar plots observations of forest structure collected from airborne discrete-return lidar transects acquired in 2010 as a surrogate for traditional field and photo plots. Mapped explanatory data included Tasseled Cap indices and multi-temporal change metrics derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ pixel-based image composites. Maps of forest structure and total aboveground biomass were created using a Random Forest (RF) implementation of Nearest Neighbor (NN) imputation. The imputation model had moderate to high plot-level accuracy across all forest attributes (R-2 values of 0.42-0.69), as well as reasonable attribute predictions and error estimates (for example, canopy cover above 2 m on validation plots averaged 35.77%, with an RMSE of 13.45%, while unsystematic and systematic agreement coefficients (AC(uns) and AC(sys)) had values of 0.63 and 0.97 respectively). Additionally, forest attributes displayed consistent trends in relation to the time since and magnitude of wildfires, indicating model predictions captured the dominant ecological patterns and processes in these forests. Acknowledging methodological and conceptual challenges based upon the use of lidar plots from transects, this study demonstrates that using lidar plots and pixel compositing in imputation mapping can provide forest inventory and monitoring information for regions lacking ongoing or up-to-date field data collection programs.

AB This study seeks to determine the role of land architecture the composition and configuration of land cover as well as cadastral-demographic-economic factors on land surface temperature (LST) and the surface urban heat island effect of Phoenix, Arizona. It employs 1 m National Agricultural Imagery Program data of land-cover with 120 m Landsat-derived land surface temperature, decomposed to 30 m, a new measure of configuration, the normalized moment of inertia, and U.S. Census data to address the question for two randomly selected samples comprising 523 and 545 residential neighborhoods (census blocks) in the city. The results indicate that, contrary to most other studies, land configuration has a stronger influence on LST than land composition. In addition, both land configuration and architecture combined with cadastral, demographic, and economic variables, capture a significant amount of explained variance in LST. The results indicate that attention to land architecture in the development of or reshaping of neighborhoods may ameliorate the summer extremes in LST. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
