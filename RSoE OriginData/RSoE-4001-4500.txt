AB Accurate and detailed soil moisture information is essential for, among other things, irrigation, drought and flood prediction, water resources management, and field-scale (i.e., tens of m) decision making. Recent satellite missions measuring soil moisture from space continue to improve the availability of soil moisture information. However, the utility of these satellite products is limited by the large footprint of the microwave sensors. This study presents a merging framework that combines a hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM), a radiative transfer model (RTM), and a Bayesian scheme to merge and downscale coarse resolution remotely sensed hydrological variables to a 30-m spatial resolution. The framework is based on HydroBlocks, an LSM that solves the field-scale spatial heterogeneity of land surface processes through interacting hydrologic response units (HRUs). The framework was demonstrated for soil moisture by coupling HydroBlocks with the Tau-Omega RTM used in the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The brightness temperature from the HydroBlocks-RTM and SMAP L3 were merged to obtain updated 30-m soil moisture. We validated the downscaled soil moisture estimates at four experimental watersheds with dense in-situ soil moisture networks in the United States and obtained overall high correlations (> 0.81) and good mean KGE score (0.56). The downscaled product captures the spatial and temporal soil moisture dynamics better than SMAP L3 and L4 product alone at both field and watershed scales. Our results highlight the value of hyper-resolution modeling to bridge the gap between coarse-scale satellite retrievals and field-scale hydrological applications.

AB The surface seasonal freeze/thaw (F/T) signal detected by passive microwave remote sensing is very important for the water cycle, carbon cycle and climate change research. In this study, we evaluated and analyzed the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) L3 F/T product, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) F/T product and Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) F/T product over different regions in China, including the Genhe area in Northeast China, the Saihanba area in North China, and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) area. The overall accuracy of F/T products assessed with the 5 cm depth soil temperature is 90.38% for SMAP, 90.23% for AMSR2 and 84.73% for MEaSUREs in cold and humid temperate forest climates and the plateau continental climate area (Genhe, Tianjun, and Qumalai) where permafrost is distributed, and 76.64% for SMAP, 83.67% for AMSR2 and 77.37% for MEaSUREs in the cold plateau mountain climate and plateau continental climate area (Saihanba and Chengduo) with frozen ground distributed seasonally, respectively. The overall accuracy is 69.05% for SMAP, 76.5% for AMSR2 and 81.4% for MEaSUREs in the Ngari, Naqu, and Dachaidan regions belonging to arid and semi-arid climates. It can be seen that SMAP and AMSR2 achieve the best performance in the distributed permafrost area, the second-best performance in the seasonal distributed permafrost area, but the worst performance in the areas with arid and semi-arid climate types due to inconsistent F/T signals between water with small changes and temperature with apparent changes during the F/T transition. The MEaSUREs product showed almost the same performance in different regions, indicating that it was less affected by climate types and the distribution of frozen soil than SMAP and AMSR2 products. SMAP F/T product detected by L-band with long penetration and AMSR2 F/T product calibrated with 5 cm soil temperature could represent the 5 cm F/T, but the MEaSUREs F/T product was more likely to describe the surface F/T state due to calibrated with air temperature and the short penetration of 36.5 GHz. In mid-low latitude areas (Tianjun and Qumalai) with a short duration of snow cover days and a fast snowmelt, the effect of snow melting on F/T products was negligible. Moreover, the spring snowmelt affects the three F/T products in Chengduo, but the SMAP product is not affected by the winter snowmelt, whereas the AMSR2 product is affected by the winter snowmelt.

AB The Geostationary Trace gas and Aerosol Sensor Optimization (GeoTASO) instrument is an airborne hyper-spectral spectrometer measuring backscattered solar radiation in the ultraviolet (290-400 nm) and visible (415-695 nm) wavelength regions. This paper presents high-resolution sulfur dioxide (SO2) maps over the Korean Peninsula, produced by SO2 retrievals from GeoTASO measurements during the Korea-United States Air Quality Field Study (KORUS-AQ) from May to June 2016. The highly sensitive GeoTASO instrument with a spatial resolution of similar to 250 m x 250 m can detect point emission sources of SO2 within its fields of view, even without merging multiple overlapping observations. To retrieve SO2 vertical columns from the GeoTASO measurements, we apply an algorithm based on principal component analysis (PCA), which is effective in suppressing noise and biases in SO2 retrievals. The retrievals successfully capture SO2 plumes and various point sources such as power plants, a petrochemical complex, and a steel mill, located in South Chungcheong Province, some of which are not detected by a ground-based in situ measurement network. Spatial distributions of SO2 from GeoTASO observations in source areas are consistent with those from the Stack Tele-Monitoring System reports and airborne in situ SO2 measurements. Comparisons of SO2 retrievals from GeoTASO and existing satellite sensors demonstrate the significance of high-resolution SO2 observations, by indicating that GeoTASO detects small SO2 emission sources that are not precisely resolved by single overpasses of satellites. To assess future geostationary SO2 observations having a higher spatial resolution, we upscale the GeoTASO SO2 retrievals to a spatial resolution of the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS). Since the upscaled GeoTASO retrievals also detect SO2 plumes clearly, we expect from GEMS to identify even small SO2 emission sources over Asia.

AB Satellite-derived fire severity metrics are a foundational tool used to estimate fire effects at the landscape scale. Changes in surface characteristics permit reasonably accurate delineation between burned and unburned areas, but variability in severity within burned areas is much more challenging to detect. Previous studies have relied primarily on categorical data to calibrate severity indices in terms of classification accuracy, but this approach does not readily translate into an expected amount of error in terms of actual tree mortality. We addressed this issue by examining a dataset of 40,370 geolocated trees that burned in the 2013 California Rim Fire using 36 Landsat-derived burn severity indices.
   The differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) performed reliably well, but the differenced SWIR:NIR ratio most accurately predicted percent basal area mortality and the differenced normalized vegetation index (dNDVI) most accurately predicted percent mortality of stems >= 10 cm diameter at breast height. Relativized versions of dNBR did not consistently improve accuracy; the relativized burn ratio (RBR) was generally equivalent to dNBR while RdNBR had consistently lower accuracy.
   There was a high degree of variability in observed tree mortality, especially at intermediate spectral index values. This translated into a considerable amount of uncertainty at the landscape scale, with an expected range in estimated percent basal area mortality greater than 37% for half of the area burned (> 50,000 ha). In other words, a 37% range in predicted mortality rate was insufficient to capture the observed mortality rate for half of the area burned. Uncertainty was even greater for percent stem mortality, with half of the area burned exceeding a 46% range in predicted mortality rate. The high degree of uncertainty in tree mortality that we observed challenges the confidence with which Landsat-derived spectral indices have been used to measure fire effects, and this has broad implications for research and management related to post-fire landscape complexity, distribution of seed sources, or persistence of fire refugia. We suggest ways to account for uncertainty that will facilitate a more nuanced and ecologically-accurate interpretation of fire effects.
   This study makes three key contributions to the field of remote sensing of fire effects: 1) we conducted the most comprehensive comparison to date of all previously published severity indices using the largest contiguous set of georeferenced tree mortality field data and revealed that the accuracy of both absolute and relative spectral indices depends on the tree mortality metric of interest;2) we conducted this study in a single, large fire that enabled us to isolate variability due to intrinsic, within-landscape factors without the additional variance due to extrinsic factors associated with different biogeographies or climatic conditions; and 3) we identified the range in tree mortality that may be indistinguishable based on spectral indices derived from Landsat satellites, and we demonstrated how this variability translates into a considerable amount of uncertainty in fire effects at the landscape scale.

AB Amazon forest leaf phenology patterns have often been inferred from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). But reliable MODIS detection of seasonal and interannual leaf phenology patterns has also been questioned and is generally not validated with field observation. Here we compare inter-annual patterns of local-scale upper canopy leaf phenology and demography derived from tower-mounted phenocams at two upland forest sites in the Central Amazon, to corresponding satellite vegetation indices retrieved from MODIS-MAIAC (Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction). We focus on forest response to an unprecedented drought caused by the El Nino of 2015-16. At both sites, multi-year phenocam data showed post-drought shifts in leaf demography. These were consistent with MODIS-MAIAC anomalies in two vegetation indices. Specifically, a precocious leaf flush at both sites during the first two post-drought months, Feb-Mar 2016, caused (1) an anomalous decrease in flushing trees in Jun Jul of 2016 and (2) an increase of trees with early mature stage leaves (2-4 mo age) in Apr-May-Jun of 2016. At both sites, these two phenological anomalies showed up in MODIS-MAIAC as, respectively, (1) a strong negative anomaly in Gcc (Green chromatic coordinate), which prior work has shown to be sensitive to the abundance of leaves 0-1 mo old, and (2) a strong positive anomaly in EVI, which is sensitive to abundance of leaves 2-4 mo age. A shift to sub-optimal seasonal leaf age mix is expected to change the ecosystem-scale intrinsic photosynthetic capacity for similar to 18 month after the drought.

AB This paper presents the validation results of GOES-16 Satellites Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) obtained from a reflectance-based field campaign undertaken at the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia in June 2017. In situ ground measurements are used to characterize the surface reflectance and the atmosphere in order to constrain the radiative transfer code and predict at-sensor reflectance (also referred to as top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance) to compare with concurrent GOES-16 ABI measurements. The five-day field campaign provided repeated TOA reflectance estimates, allowing assessment not only of the calibration accuracy of the ABI reflective channels 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, but also of its stability over the duration of the campaign. The results show that the accuracy of the ABI reflective channels calibration is within specification for channels 1, 3, 5, and 6 - average biases within 2%; for channel 2 the bias is 5%. The estimated uncertainty on the derived biases is 2-2.4%. Some calibration stability issues were present in the ABI calibration at the time of the campaign: (i) a jump on the order of 2% in channels 1 and 6, coincident with an ABI solar calibration event, reflects an instability of the ABI gains in these channels, and (ii) short-term variability in channels 1 and 2 is due to striping (ABI detector-to-detector calibration differences). Continued validation and subsequent reprocessing of ABI reflectance imagery would allow Earth scientists to fully benefit from the high spatial and spectral fidelity of the GOES-16 ABI diurnal measurements at the continental scale.

AB We develop a statistical approach to evaluate the performance of the ocean color data processing system for satellite-derived ocean color data products based on temporal stability of retrievals. We use the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system to obtain the normalized water-leaving reflectance rho(wN)(lambda) spectra from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) measurements. The deviations of rho(wN)(lambda) spectra from temporally and spatially averaged values are investigated, and the statistics with respect to various retrieval parameters are collected, including the solar-sensor geometry (solar-zenith, sensor-zenith, and relative azimuth angles), and various ancillary data (surface wind speed, surface atmospheric pressure, water vapor amount, and ozone concentration). The performance of MSL12 is also evaluated with respect to other intermediate retrieval parameters. The study shows that MSL12 produces statistically consistent VIIRS ocean color retrievals in the global open ocean, with respect to retrieval geometry parameters, as well as the ancillary inputs.

AB The anisotropy of directional radiative surface temperature measurements over urban building surfaces is expected to have strong temporal variation. However, a model with the capability to simulate the temporal variation of urban thermal anisotropy (UTA) and with inversion abilities has not yet been developed. In this paper, the relationship between the temporal variation of UTA and temperature contrasts among surface components is investigated. Based on a system of previously developed geometric models for simulation of thermal anisotropy in simplified urban neighborhoods of different densities, a system of advanced geometric models, GUTA-T, is proposed that incorporates the temporal variability of UTA through the dependence of temperature contrasts on solar zenith angle theta(s) under clear skies. A 3-D microscale urban surface temperature model and a sensor view model are combined to generate a synthetic UTA dataset for a variety of simplified urban geometries and with which to evaluate GUTA-T. The results show that parameter inversions are sensitive to sun-surface-sensor geometries. The seasonal and hourly behavior of anisotropy is simulated by GUTA-T with mean absolute differences of 1.06 degrees C, 1.25 degrees C, 1.69 degrees C and 1.04 degrees C for the view zenith and azimuth angles (theta(v), phi(v)) of (40 degrees, 90 degrees), (60 degrees, 270 degrees), (60 degrees, 180 degrees) and (40 degrees, 130 degrees), respectively. Evaluation using diurnal measurements over an urban scale model shows that the root mean square difference between simulated anisotropy and the reference anisotropy generated from observed directional temperatures and a high-accuracy computer model is 2.02 degrees C for theta(s) <= 60 degrees. If the proposed model is to be calibrated with satellite data, a second directional observation from the opposite side of the surface target area can improve model performance significantly. Calibrations using samples including only small (e.g., theta(s) >= 30 degrees) or large s (e.g., theta(s) >= 50 degrees) tend to decrease the anisotropy time-series simulation accuracy. Due to its inversion abilities, the GUTA-T model has the potential to simulate and correct anisotropy in time-series thermal infrared remote sensing data, thereby improving the analysis either of spatial variation within an image, or of temporal variation of angular urban surface temperature.

AB The aerosol forcing is an essential factor of global climate change, which can be estimated by various models. However, the model results ranging from -2.8 to 2.2 K remain controversial because of unavoidable uncertainty, leaving a great gap for global change prediction. This study aims to evaluate the forcing on the land surface temperature (Ts) using satellite-based observations. Based on the Blackbody radiation and surface radiation budget, first, a semi-physical framework is developed to estimate the Ts. Subsequently, the aerosol forcing is calculated by measuring the Ts difference between the changing aerosol scenario and baseline scenario with a fixed aerosol amount. Results show that the framework simulates Ts with acceptable accuracy (R = 0.62 and RMSE = 1.48 K), which supports the estimation of aerosol forcing. Generally, the change in the aerosol contributes 0.005 +/- 0.237 K to the global Ts, which presents significant temporal and spatial variabilities. Temporally, the forcing shows a decreasing trend of -0.0006 K/year (R-2 = 0.29, p = 0.031). Spatially, the forcing tends to warm the surface in regions with arid climate, low-cloud fraction, and moderate vapor or in sparsely vegetated and cool regions because of the potential interactions with climatic and environmental factors. The result of this study helps to reduce the uncertainty and validate the model results, which further supports the research on global climatic and environmental change.

AB As the world's largest city cluster, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) is vulnerable to significant subsidence. The widely distributed sediments and rapid urbanization in the GBA result in the concurrence of large- and small-scale subsidence. Mono-sensor synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images usually suffer from the limitation of either low resolution or small coverage, and thus, are not applicable to completely monitoring the GBA. In this study, we used Sentinel-1 (S1), COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) and TerraSAR-X (TSX) images jointly to reveal multi-scale subsidence of the GBA. The overall subsidence ranged from 0 to 112.3 mm/yr derived from the 2015-2017 S1 images. Three regional subsidence bowls (Zhuhai-Zhongshan, Jiangmen, and Guangzhou-Zhongshan) formed in the western alluvial plain. The high correlation between regional subsidence and Quaternary sediments confirms that sediment consolidation is the main cause of subsidence. The land use and numerical modeling results suggest that groundwater extraction and artificial loading are the triggering factors. Two representative local subsidence cases were analyzed using high-resolution images: reclamation settlement at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and sinkhole subsidence due to the excavation of the Shenzhen Wenbo skyscraper foundation pit. The validation at the HKIA showed that the measurements from the CSK and S1 data both agreed well with the leveling data. However, CSK outperformed S1 in the sense that it increased the point density by a factor of 5, improved the height precision by a factor of 4, and showed fewer false alarms. CSK is therefore more applicable to monitoring the local subsidence of key infrastructures. The cross-heading tracks of TSX and CSK images detected precursory subsidence before the sinkhole collapse from two sides, indicating that the cross-heading tracks benefit the comprehensive monitoring of local subsidence in high-rise and high-density built environments. In summary, the synergistic use of multi-sensor SAR images demonstrates the practicability of the operational surveillance of multi-scale subsidence from regional surveying to the fine monitoring of local areas in the GBA.

AB Widespread and persistent Ecosystem Disruptive Algal Blooms dominated by marine picocyanobacteria (Synechococcus) commonly occur in the subtropical lagoonal estuary of Florida Bay (U.S.A). These blooms have been linked to a decline in natural sheet flow over the past century from upstream Everglades National Park. Remote sensing algorithms for monitoring cyanobacteria blooms are highly desired but have been mainly developed for freshwater and coastal systems with minimal bottom reflectance contributions in the past. Examination of in situ optical properties revealed that Synechococcus blooms in Florida Bay exhibit unique spectral absorption and reflectance features that form the basis for algorithm development. Using a large, multi-year match-up dataset (2002-2012; n = 682) consisting of in situ pigment concentrations and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc(lambda)), classification criteria for detecting cyanobacteria blooms with chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) similar to 5-40 mg m(-3) were determined based on a new approach to combine the MODIS Cyanobacteria Index, CIMODIS, and spectral shape around 488 nm, SS(488). The inclusion of SS(488) was required to prevent false positive classifications in seagrass-rich, non-bloom waters with high bottom reflectance contributions. 75% of cyanobacteria blooms were classified accurately based on this modified CI approach with < 1% false positives. A strong correlation observed between cyanobacteria bloom in situ Chl-a and CIMODIS r(2) = 0.80, n = 32) then allowed cyanobacterial chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl(cl)) to be estimated. Model simulations and image-based analyses showed that this technique was insensitive to variable aerosol properties and sensor viewing geometry. Application of the approach to the entire MODIS time-series (2000 present) may help identify factors controlling blooms and system responses to ongoing management efforts aimed at restoring flow to pre-drainage conditions. The method may also provide insights for algorithm development for other lagoonal estuaries that experience similar blooms.

AB The light absorption coefficient of vegetation is related to the content and composition of pigments in the plant canopy. It is a useful metric for understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of the absorbed solar radiation, photosynthetic capacity, and productivity of vegetation. Still, its estimation in vivo is challenging due to the large variability induced by numerous features: canopy-related factors, including biochemical and structural characteristics, and factors external to the canopy such as soil background, solar irradiation, and sun-target sensor geometry conditions. Here we revisit a semi-analytical modeling framework for deriving the light absorption coefficient of plant canopies from reflectance data. The proposed approach is based on the partition of the total light absorption coefficient into photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigment components in the canopy, and canopy backscattering. The model-derived absorption coefficient of chlorophyll was compared with field matchups of total canopy chlorophyll content in three crops with contrasting leaf structures, canopy architectures and photosynthetic pathways: maize, soybean, and rice. The model allows for the derivation of absorption coefficient spectra across the photosynthetically active radiation and the red edge spectral regions, as well as accurate estimations of canopy chlorophyll content, both of which are necessary for analyzing the physiological and phenological status, and the canopy-level photosynthetic capacity, of plants.

AB The recent emergence of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has opened a new horizon in vegetation remote sensing, especially for agricultural applications. However, the benefits of UAV centimeter-scale imagery are still unclear compared to coarser resolution data acquired from satellites or aircrafts. This study aims (i) to propose novel methods for retrieving canopy variables from UAV multispectral observations, and (ii) to investigate to what extent the use of such centimeter-scale imagery makes it possible to improve the estimation of leaf and canopy variables in sugar beet crops (Beta vulgaris L.). Five important structural and biochemical plant traits are considered: green fraction (GF), green area index (GAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), as well as canopy chlorophyll (CCC) and nitrogen (CNC) contents.
   Based on a comprehensive data set encompassing a large variability in canopy structure and biochemistry, the results obtained for every targeted trait demonstrate the superiority of centimeter-resolution methods over two standard remote-sensing approaches (i.e., vegetation indices and PROSAIL inversion) applied to average canopy reflectances. Two variables (denoted GF(GREENPIX) and VICAB) extracted from the images are shown to play a major role in these performances. GFGREENPix is the GF estimate obtained by thresholding the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) image, and is shown to be an accurate and robust (e.g., against variable illumination conditions) proxy of the structure of sugar beet canopies, i.e., GF and GAL VICAB is the mND(blue) index value averaged over the darkest green pixels, and provides critical information on C-ab. When exploited within uni-or multivariate empirical models, these two variables improve the GF, GAL C-ab, CCC and CNC estimates obtained with standard approaches, with gains in estimation accuracy of 24, 8, 26, 37 and 8%, respectively. For example, the best CCC estimates (R-2 = 0.90) are obtained by multiplying C-ab and GAI estimates respectively derived from VICAB and a log-transformed version of GF(GREENPIX), log(1-GF(GREENPIX)).
   The GF(GREENIPIX) and VICAB variables, which are only accessible from centimeter-scale imagery, contributes to a better identification of the effects of canopy structure and leaf biochemistry, whose influences may be confounded when considering coarser resolution observations. Such results emphasize the strong benefits of centimeter-scale UAV imagery over satellite or airborne remote sensing, and demonstrate the relevance of low-cost multispectral cameras to retrieve a number of plant traits, e.g., for agricultural applications.

AB Climate change is causing novel forest stress around the world due to changes in environmental conditions. Forest pest insects, such as Ips typographus (L.), are spreading toward the northern latitudes and are now able to produce more generations in their current range; this has increased forest disturbances. Timely information on tree decline is critical in allowing forest managers to plan effective countermeasures and to forecast potential infestation areas. Field-based infestation surveys of bark beetles have traditionally involved visual estimates of entrance holes, resin flow, and maternal-gallery densities; such estimates are prone to error and bias. Thus, objective and automated methods for estimating tree infestation status are required.
   In this study, we investigated the feasibility of dual-wavelength terrestrial lidar in the estimation and detection of I. typographus infestation symptoms. In addition, we examined the relationship between leaf water content (measured as gravimetric water content and equivalent water thickness) and infestation severity. Using two terrestrial lidar systems (operating at 905 nm and 1550 nm), we measured 29 mature Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) trees that exhibited low or moderate infestation symptoms. We calculated single and dual wavelength lidar intensity metrics from stem and crown points to test these metrics' ability to discriminate I. typographus infestation levels using regressions and linear discriminant analyses.
   Across the various I. typographus infestation levels, we found significant differences (p < 0.05) in gravimetric water content, but not in equivalent water thickness due to the latter statistic's high correlation with leaf density. The results show correlations between the lidar intensity metrics and several infestation symptoms: defoliation, discoloration and resin flow. The intensity metrics explain 50% of the variation in the infestation severity (as determined in the field based on canopy and stem symptoms). The overall accuracy with three infestation classes (no, low, or moderate) was 66%, but the overall accuracy with two infestation classes (not infested, or infested) was 90%. The classifiers combine lidar intensity metrics from the stem and the canopy to allow for the detection of bark-beetle infestations in the early, so called green-attack stage. The intensity metrics explain part of the variations in tree-level gravimetric water content and equivalent water thickness, with adjusted R-2 values of 0.48 and 0.68, respectively. Terrestrial dual-wavelength lidar shows potential for providing objective tree-decline measurements at tree level: this method can be further used to enhance forest inventories and automate tree vigor data collection, which has traditionally required expert knowledge.

AB To assess the accuracy of individual tree crown (ITC) delineation techniques the same tree needs to be identified in two different datasets, for example, ground reference (GR) data and crowns delineated from LiDAR. Many studies use arbitrary metrics or simple linear-distance thresholds to match trees in different datasets without quantifying the level of agreement. For example, successful match-pairing is often claimed where two data points, representing the same tree in different datasets, are located within 5 m of one another. Such simple measures are inadequate for representing the multi-variate nature of ITC delineations and generate misleading measures of delineation accuracy. In this study, we develop a new framework for objectively quantifying the agreement between GR and remotely-sensed tree datasets: the Accuracy of Remotely-sensed Biophysical Observation and Retrieval (ARBOR) framework. Using common biophysical properties of ITC delineated trees (location, height and crown area), trees represented in different data sets were modelled as overlapping Gaussian curves to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the level of agreement. Extensive testing quantified the limitations of some frequently used match-pairing methods, in particular, the Hausdorff distance algorithm. We demonstrate that within the ARBOR framework, the Hungarian combinatorial optimisation algorithm improves the match between datasets, while the Jaccard similarity coefficient is effective for measuring the correspondence between the matched data populations. The ARBOR framework was applied to GR and remotely-sensed tree data from a woodland study site to demonstrate how ARBOR can identify the optimum ITC delineation technique, out of four different methods tested, based on two measures of statistical accuracy. Using ARBOR will limit further reliance on arbitrary thresholds as it provides an objective approach for quantifying accuracy in the development and application of ITC delineation algorithms.

AB Multi-sensor remote sensing is a critical part of the surveillance of coastal ocean for hazard management. The world's largest green macroalgae blooms (green tide) in the Yellow Sea since 2007 are caused by the macroalgae of Ulva, which are disposed as biofoulings into sea water when workers recycle seaweed (Porphyra) farming facilities. We traced the development processes of seaweed cultivation in which area since 2000 and the variation in macroalgal blooms since 2007 through multi-sensors (satellite, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, and ground spectroradiometer) remote sensing in this study. We found that the sudden occurrence of large-scale green tide in 2007 and the increasing trend since that year were caused by the seaweed aquaculture in a specific mode at specific locations. A numerical simulation and satellite observations on the relationship between the timing of recycling seaweed facilities and the volume of green tide suggest that the green tide is manageable. Adoption of multi-sensor, multi-scale, and multi-temporal observations, translocating seaweed farming sites, and changing the cultivation mode are deemed as key tools for controlling the green tide and sustaining the seaweed aqua culture.

AB This work is based on the retrospective analysis of several geophysical observations to search for possible lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling effects in the preparatory phase of the Central Italy seismic sequence 2016-2017. The major seismic events occurred on 24 August 2016 (Mw 6.0 Amatrice earthquake), 30 October 2016 (Norcia mainshock, Mw 6.5) and on 18 January 2017 (four M5+ events close to Campotosto-Montereale).
   The work consists of a multi parametric approach over different observables from ground and space: the geomagnetic field (from satellites and observatories), atmospheric chemical/physical composition, with the comparison with other already published results from chemistry of groundwater and seismicity.
   In particular, we investigated the vector magnetic data from INGV ground L'Aquila and Duronia magnetic Observatories and ESA Swarm three-satellite constellation. In addition, we searched for anomalies in physical/chemical composition of the atmosphere using MERRA-2 climatological dataset over Central Italy before the start of the seismic sequence.
   Two anomalous conditions anticipating the seismic sequence by about 275 and 85 days from geomagnetic Observatories and by about 240 days from satellite have been found. Furthermore, two highly perturbed periods in atmosphere chemical/physical composition that precede by 200 and 150 days the start of seismic sequence have been discovered.
   A comparison with also other published papers' results to validate and integrate our findings is finally presented. We find a chain of some quasi synchronous anomalies and propose a global point of view demonstrating that the earthquake preparation phase affects the equilibrium of the Earth system producing anomalies from around a year in lithosphere, atmosphere and ionosphere.

AB Spatially explicit information on crop yields is essential for farmers and agricultural agencies to make well-informed decisions. One approach to estimate crop yield with remote sensing is data assimilation, which integrates sequential observations of canopy development from remote sensing into model simulations of crop growth processes. However, it remains challenging to efficiently scale this approach to large areas while maintaining reliable prediction at field scales. In this paper, we explored the factors limiting the generalization of the data assimilation approach and found that the accuracy of crop model prediction and the systematic model errors can significantly affect the performance of data assimilation and the yield estimation. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical data assimilation framework, which enables maize yield estimation at field levels across large areas for the Midwestern US with no a priori knowledge about the management of individual fields. This approach applies data assimilation algorithms at two spatial scales. At the county scale, we adopted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to recalibrate uncertain and sensitive model parameters based on aggregated Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series derived from Landsat images and county-level yield statistics. Using the county-specific models, we assimilated LAI time series into crop model simulations using Ensemble Kalman Filter for individual fields or pixels. This method was validated by multiple field-level maize yield datasets across major production states in the US Midwest. The Root Mean Squared Error ranges from 1.4 to 2.3 ton/ha, and the percentage error is between 9% and 21%. The hierarchical data assimilation framework provides a novel solution that downscales county-level yield statistics to 30-meter resolution yield maps, which can inform between and within field maize yield variability. This study contributes valuable insights towards practical large-scale crop yield mapping at high resolutions.

AB Uncertainties in estimation of albedo-related radiative forcing cause ambiguity in evaluation of net climate effects of forests and forest management. Numerous studies have reported local relations between forest structure and albedo in the boreal zone. However, more research is needed to establish these relations for geographically extensive areas, and to examine seasonal courses of albedo to understand the effects of forest structure on mean annual shortwave energy balance. Remote sensing is a viable option for accomplishing these goals, but there are many challenges related to e.g. long periods of cloud cover and low solar elevations in high latitudes. We used the new MODIS Collection 6 (MCD43A3) daily albedo product, and analyzed MODIS albedo dependence on airborne LiDAR-based forest structure in 22 study sites in Estonia, Finland, Sweden, and Russia (57 degrees-69 degrees N, 12 degrees-57 degrees E). Wall-to-wall LiDAR data allowed us to take into account the effective spatial resolution of MODIS, which notably improved correlations between albedo and forest structure. Use of the best quality backup algorithm (magnitude inversion) together with main algorithm results in the MODIS albedo product did not reduce the correlations compared to using main algorithm only. We quantified the effects of landscape-level forest structure (forest height, canopy cover, fraction of young forest) and fraction of broadleaved deciduous forest on mean annual albedo. We showed that because the forest structure-albedo relations are the strongest in snow-covered periods, and because the snow-covered period is longest in the north, the effect of forest structure on mean annual albedo increases towards the north. On the other hand, the effect of broadleaved fraction did not show such latitudinal trend. Our results indicate that even within a single climatic zone the optimal forest management solution to mitigate climate change depends on geographic location.

AB Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) is a widely applied tool to retrieve spatially explicit information on urban land cover from both hyperspectral and multispectral data, but is still prone to misclassification errors when faced with high inter-class similarity, typical of the complex urban environment. In this study we assessed multiple ways to minimize spectral confusion using airborne lidar data as an additional data source and spectral feature selection. Several approaches were tested using simulated hyperspectral data and two case studies in the city of Brussels, Belgium, one based on hyperspectral (APEX) data and one on multispectral (Sentinel-2) data. We found that the implementation of height distribution information (1) as an endmember model selection tool and (2) as a basis for additional fraction constraints at the individual pixel scale, significantly reduced spectral confusion between spectrally similar, but structurally different land cover classes (on average by 80% for the APEX case). This had a net positive effect on subpixel fraction estimations (average R2 increased from 0.34 to 0.80 and from 0.23 to 0.63 for APEX and Sentinel-2, respectively) and pixel classification accuracies (kappa increased from 0.38 to 0.6 for the APEX case). When applied to fine spatial resolution data containing many single-class pixels, endmember model selection based on height information resulted in the additional benefit of lowering computation times by 85%. Spectral feature selection successfully discarded redundant spectral information (on average retaining only 19 out of 218 bands), thereby further lowering processing times by 50%, without affecting accuracies. Despite these significant improvements, spectral confusion remained an issue between classes showing no distinction in height information, particularly pavement and soil. Future research should therefore focus on integrating the proposed approach with advanced endmember detection and selection algorithms, along with exploring innovative ways of highlighting small spectral differences using spectral transformations. The algorithm we propose constitutes a viable approach for mapping of structurally diverse ecosystems, such as urban environments, at multiple spatial scales and with varying level of thematic detail.

AB Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and lidar are increasingly used active remote sensing techniques for forest structure observation. The TanDEM-X (TDX) InSAR mission of German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the upcoming Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) together may provide more accurate estimates of global forest structure and biomass via their synergic use. In this paper, we explored the efficacy of simulated GEDI data in improving height estimates from TDX InSAR data. Our study sites span three major forest types: a temperate forest, a mountainous conifer forest, and a tropical rainforest. The GEDI lidar coverage was simulated for the full nominal two-year mission duration, under both cloud-free and 50%-cloud conditions. We then used these GEDI data to parameterize the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) model driven by TDX imagery. In particular, we explored the following three strategies for forest structure estimation: 1) TDX data alone; 2) TDX + GEDI-derived digital terrain model (DTM); and 3) TDX + GEDI DTM + GEDI canopy height. We then validated the retrieved forest heights against wall-to-wall airborne lidar measurements. We found relatively large biases at 90 [m] spatial resolution, from 4.2-11.9 [m], and root mean square errors (RMSEs), from 7.9-12.7 [m] when using TDX data alone under constrained RVoG assumptions of a fixed extinction coefficient (sigma) and a zero ground-to-volume amplitude ratio (mu = 0). Results improved significantly with the aid of a DTM derived from GEDI data which enabled estimation of spatially-varying a values (vs. fixed extinction) under a mu = 0 assumption, with biases reduced to 1.7-4.2 [m] and RMSEs to 4.9-8.6 [m] across cloudy and cloud-free cases. The best agreement was achieved in the third strategy by also incorporating information of GEDI-derived canopy height to further enhance the RVoG parameters. The improved model, when still assuming mu = 0, reduced biases to less than or close to 1 m and further reduced RMSEs to 4.0-6.7 [m]. Finally, we used GEDI data to estimate spatially-varying mu in the RVoG model. We found biases of between -0.7-0.9 [m] and RMSEs in the range from 2.6-7.1 [m] over the three sites. Our results suggest that use of GEDI data improves height inversion from TDX, providing heights at more accuracy than can be achieved by TDX alone, and enabling wall-to-wall height estimation at much finer spatial resolution than can be achieved by GEDI alone.

AB Photosynthesis is a critical component to understanding how CO2 uptake and vegetation productivity drives the terrestrial carbon cycle. Light use efficiency (LUE) is a key indicator of photosynthesis, which is determined by the most limiting/co-limiting environmental stresses such as nutrition, water, and temperature, restraining the photochemical reaction process across both space and time due to remote sensing offers a capability to relate changes in LUE with changes in the spectral characteristics of leaves through the photochemical reflectance index (PRI). The PRI is a narrow waveband index that responds with changes in xanthophyll-induced absorption feature at 531 nm. It remains challenging, however, to upscale PRI from leaf to canopy and ultimately to the landscape level due to physiological and structural factors such as leaf angle distribution, leaf area, canopy structure and pigment pool size as well as observational considerations such as sun-view geometry and background reflectance. As a result, understanding patterns of PRI and LUE across different climate-induced stress conditions and within age-induced vertical stand structures is helpful for improving our understanding how these relationships change over forested landscapes in anticipation of future airborne and ultimately satellite based observations. In this study, we report on the use of the automated multi-angular spectro-radiometer (AMSPEC) and eddy-covariance techniques to examine how PRI and LUE varies at young (HDF88) and older (DF49) Douglas-fir sites. Results indicate that a strong relationship between bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) corrected PRI and LUE exists (DF49: R-2 = 0.73; HDF88: R-2 = 0.79). The overall LUE at the older, more structurally complex site was higher than at the younger, structurally simpler stand under a range of air temperature and light conditions. We used the standard deviation (SD) of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) return pulses to characterize canopy vertical structure of the site, and found that complex vertical structures (i.e., high SD) may contribute to a higher long-term averaged LUE (R-2 = 0.87). While interesting we conclude the mechanism of the relationship between LUE and vertical forest structures needs to be further explored because of the key role internal and external shadowing has on light regimes with stands and thus vertical patterns of LUE varying across forest stands of different age.

AB Strong ocean currents can modify the height and shape of ocean waves, possibly causing extreme sea states in particular conditions. The risk of extreme waves is a known hazard in the shipping routes crossing some of the main current systems. Modeling surface current interactions in standard wave numerical models is an active area of research that benefits from the increased availability and accuracy of satellite observations. We report a typical case of a swell system propagating in the Agulhas current, using wind and sea state measurements from several satellites, jointly with state of the art analytical and numerical modeling of wave-current interactions. In particular, Synthetic Aperture Radar and altimeter measurements are used to show the evolution of the swell train and resulting local extreme waves. A ray tracing analysis shows that the significant wave height variability at scales < similar to 100 km is well associated with the current vorticity patterns. Predictions of the WAVEWATCH III numerical model in a version that accounts for wave-current interactions are consistent with observations, although their effects are still under-predicted in the present configuration. From altimeter measurements, very large significant wave height gradients are shown to be well captured, and also associated with the current vorticity patterns at global scale.

AB The occurrence of water shortages ascribed to projected climate change, especially in the Mediterranean region, fosters the interest in remote sensing (RS) applications to optimize water use in agriculture. Remote sensing evapotranspiration and water demand estimation over large cultivated areas were used to manage irrigation to minimize losses during the crop growing cycle. The research aimed to explore the potential of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) sensor on board Sentinel-2A to estimate crop parameters, mainly surface albedo (alpha) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) that influence the dynamics of potential evapotranspiration (ETp) and Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) of processing tomato crop (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Maximum tomato ETp was calculated according to the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-56 PM) using appropriate values of canopy parameters derived by processing Sentinel-2A data in combination with daily weather information. For comparison, we used the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) derived from the soil water balance (SWB) module in the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model and calibrated with in-situ Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM). The experiment was set up in a privately-owned farm located in the Tarquinia irrigation district (Central Italy) during two growing seasons, within the framework of the EU Project FATIMA (FArming Tools for external nutrient Inputs and water Management). The results showed that canopy growth, maximum evapotranspiration (ETp) and IWR were accurately inferred from satellite observations following seasonal rainfall and air temperature patterns. The net estimated IWR from satellite observations for the two-growing seasons was about 272 and 338 mm in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Such estimated requirement was lower compared with the actual amount supplied by the farmer with sprinkler and drip micro-irrigation system in both growing seasons resulting in 364 (276 mm drip micro-irrigation, and 88 mm sprinkler) and 662 (574 mm drip micro-irrigation, and 88 mm sprinkler) mm, respectively. Our findings indicated the suitability of Sentinel-2A to predict tomato water demand at field level, providing useful information for optimizing the irrigation over extended farmland.

AB The availability of remote sensing images of various resolutions has enabled the incorporation of landscape structures in land-cover mapping. Despite the effectiveness of landscape metrics in quantifying landscape structures, they are inadequate in characterizing three elements: spatial neighborhoods, spatial dependencies, and semantic dependencies. Moreover, methods for mining the regularity of landscape-structure heterogeneity (i.e., spatial variations in landscape structures) are still limited, particularly for applications in urban land-cover mapping. This study hence proposes a novel approach with the aims to (1) characterize landscape structures considering the above three elements; (2) mine the regularity of landscape-structure heterogeneity; and (3) apply landscape-structure information as contexts to improve urban land-cover mapping. To achieve the first aim, landscape-structure features including pair-wise spatial relationships and neighborhood-based landscape metrics are defined. To accomplish the second aim, a clustering technique and a landscape infographic are used to cluster landscape structures and visualize landscape-structure types, respectively. Finally, a hierarchical classifier based on the feedforward multi-layer perceptron is developed for the third aim. Experiments are conducted in a heterogeneous urban environment in Beijing, China. The results show that the proposed approach, which considers 34 landscape-structure features and 19 landscape-structure types, achieves a classification accuracy improvement of 6.43% compared with the approaches without considering landscape-structure information. This study therefore demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating landscape-structure features and landscape-structure types in improving urban land-cover mapping.

AB The proximity of seagrass meadows to centers of human activity makes them vulnerable to a variety of habitat degrading insults. Physical scarring has long been recognized as an important but difficult-to-quantify source of habitat fragmentation and seagrass loss. We present a pixel-based algorithm to detect seafloor propeller seagrass scars in shallow water that promises to automate the detection and measurement of scars across the submarine landscape. (1)We applied the algorithm to multispectral and panchromatic images captured at the Deckle Beach, Florida using the WorldView-2 commercial satellite. The algorithm involves four steps using spectral and spatial information from radiometrically calibrated multispectral and panchromatic images. First, we fused multispectral and panchromatic images using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based pan-sharpening method to obtain multispectral pan-sharpened bands. In the second step, we enhanced the image contrast of the pan-sharpened bands for better scar detection. In the third step, we classified the contrast enhanced image pixels into scar and non-scar categories based on a sparse coding algorithm that produced an initial scar map in which false positive scar pixels were also present. In the fourth step, we applied post-processing techniques including a morphological filter and local orientation to reduce false positives. Our results show that the proposed method may be implemented on a regular basis to monitor changes in habitat characteristics of coastal waters.

AB Imaging spectroscopy is a powerful tool for mapping chemical leaf traits at the canopy level. However, covariance with structural canopy properties is hampering the ability to predict leaf biochemical traits in structurally heterogeneous forests. Here, we used imaging spectroscopy data to map canopy level leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus concentrations (P-mass) of a temperate mixed forest. By integrating predictor variables derived from airborne laser scanning (LiDAR), capturing the biophysical complexity of the canopy, we aimed at improving predictions of N-mass and P-mass. We used partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to link community weighted means of both leaf constituents with 245 hyperspectral bands (426-2425 nm) and 38 LiDAR-derived variables. LiDAR-derived variables improved the model's explained variances for N-mass (R-cv(2) 0.31 vs. 0.41, % RSMEcv 3.3 vs. 3.0) and P-mass (R-cv(2) 0.45 vs. 0.63, % RSMEcv 15.3 vs. 12.5). The predictive performances of N-mass models using hyperspectral bands only, decreased with increasing structural heterogeneity included in the calibration dataset. To test the independent contribution of canopy structure we additionally fit the models using only LiDAR-derived variables as predictors. Resulting values ranged from 0.26 for N-mass to 0.54 for 13,P-mass indicating considerable covariation between biochemical traits and forest structural properties. N-mass was negatively related to the spatial heterogeneity of canopy density, whereas Pm, was negatively related to stand height and to the total cover of tree canopies. In the specific setting of this study, the importance of structural variables can be attributed to the presence of two tree species, featuring structural and biochemical properties different from co-occurring species. Still, existing functional linkages between structure and biochemistry at the leaf and canopy level suggest that canopy structure, used as proxy, can in general support the mapping of leaf biochemistry over broad spatial extents.

AB The Visible and Infra-Red Radiometer (VIRR) is an improved third-generation sensor used for Earth observation with channels ranging from visible to thermal bands and carried on board the Chinese FengYun-3C satellite. An active fire detection algorithm based on VIRR data has already been designed and tested in different study areas worldwide. Most of the previously related algorithms were developed merely focusing on the spatial and spectral features of pixels while the temporal attributes of these observed active fires were ignored. In this research, multi-temporal VIRR data were used to construct time series of pixels. The core content of the algorithm consists of the changes in the time-series profiles together with the observed data. By calculating the predicted mid infrared (MIR) value and the stable MIR value of the target area, fire pixels can be easily distinguished. To assess the performance of this algorithm, a total of eight target areas distributed across the world were used for testing. Two stages of validation were carried out with data of different spatial resolutions. A rough comparison was carried out first. During this step, results from Collection 6 of MODIS Fire and Thermal Anomalies products (MOD14A1) and results generated from the previously used algorithm were used for comparison. The detailed validation work was conducted with the support of Landsat series (including ETM + and OLI sensors) data even though the different imaging time may affect the actual validation results.

AB Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) offers a potentially inexpensive source of reference data for estimating area and assessing map accuracy in the context of remote-sensing based land-cover monitoring. The quality of observations from VGI and the typical lack of an underlying probability sampling design raise concerns regarding use of VGI in widely-applied design-based statistical inference. This article focuses on the fundamental issue of sampling design used to acquire VGI. Design-based inference requires the sample data to be obtained via a probability sampling design. Options for incorporating VGI within design-based inference include: 1) directing volunteers to obtain data for locations selected by a probability sampling design; 2) treating VGI data as a "certainty stratum" and augmenting the VGI with data obtained from a probability sample; and 3) using VGI to create an auxiliary variable that is then used in a model-assisted estimator to reduce the standard error of an estimate produced from a probability sample. The latter two options can be implemented using VGI data that were obtained from a non-probability sampling design, but require additional sample data to be acquired via a probability sampling design. If the only data available are VGI obtained from a non-probability sample, properties of design-based inference that are ensured by probability sampling must be replaced by assumptions that may be difficult to verify. For example, pseudo-estimation weights can be constructed that mimic weights used in stratified sampling estimators. However, accuracy and area estimates produced using these pseudo-weights still require the VGI data to be representative of the full population, a property known as "external validity". Because design-based inference requires a probability sampling design, directing volunteers to locations specified by a probability sampling design is the most straightforward option for use of VGI in design-based inference. Combining VGI from a non-probability sample with data from a probability sample using the certainty stratum approach or the model-assisted approach are viable alternatives that meet the conditions required for design based inference and use the VGI data to advantage to reduce standard errors.

AB The Cryosat-2 Synthetic Aperture Interferometric Radar Altimeter (SIRAL) altimeter is the first altimeter that can operate in three different modes over the ocean: the classical pulse limited LRM, the Delay Doppler or SAR and the SAR Interferometric modes. It offers a unique opportunity to test, validate and compare the capabilities of the three modes for the detection and analysis of small icebergs (< 3 km in length) already demonstrated for classical altimeters. Over most of the sea-ice free ocean, SIRAL operates in LRM mode and the classical iceberg detection algorithm can be applied without modification. It can also be applied to the Reduced SAR or pseudo-LRM data computed from SAR and SARin data. In SAR mode, iceberg signatures are bright spots in the waveform thermal noise part. They can be easily detected using classical image processing tools. The area of the iceberg is estimated using the size of the signature. In SARin mode, the coherence of the signals can insure the presence of scatterers above the sea surface and is used with the SAR detection algorithm to reduce the probability of false alarm and to better delineate icebergs. Interferometry allows for the first time to map the iceberg and the iceberg free-board at an unprecedented resolution opening a new way of investigation of the distributions of size, freeboard and volume of the small icebergs that are responsible of large fraction of the freshwater flux into the ocean.

AB Soil information with high spatial and temporal resolution is crucial to assess potential soil degradation and to achieve sustainable productivity and ultimately food security. The spatial resolution of existing soil maps can commonly be too coarse to account for local soil variations and owing to the cost and resource needs required to update information these maps lack temporal information. With improved computational processing capabilities, increased data storage and most recently, the increasing amount of freely available data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel-2A/B), remote sensing imagery can be integrated into existing soil mapping approaches to increase temporal and spatial resolution of soil information. Satellite multi-temporal data allows for generating cloud free, radiometrically and phenologically consistent pixel based image composites of regional scale. Such data sets are of particular use for extracting soil information in areas of intermediate climate where soils are rarely exposed. The Soil Composite Mapping Processor (SCMaP) is a new approach designed to make use of per-pixel compositing to overcome the issue of limited soil exposure. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the automated processors ability to handle large image databases to build multispectral reflectance composite base data layers that can support large scale top soil analyses. The functionality of the SCMaP is demonstrated using Landsat imagery over Germany from 1984 to 2014 applied over 5 year periods. Three primary product levels are generated that will allow for a long term assessment and distribution of soils that include the distribution of exposed soils, a statistical information related to soil use and intensity and the generation of exposed soil reflectance image composites. The resulting composite maps provide useful value-added information on soils with the exposed soil reflectance composites showing high spatial coverage that correlate well with existing soil maps and the underlying geological structural regions.

AB Surface albedo is widely used in climate and environment applications as an important parameter for controlling the surface energy budget. There is an increasing need for albedo data to be available for use in applications that require a fine spatial resolution and for validating coarse-resolution datasets; however, such products with long-term global coverage are not available thus far. Existing algorithms for Landsat albedo estimation all require surface reflectance from explicit and reliable atmospheric correction, which may sometimes be unavailable or carry uncertainties due to saturated visible bands or a lack of dense vegetation. In addition, most of the existing algorithms require concurrent clear-sky observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction, which limited the data availability for Landsat albedo estimation. To overcome these problems, in this study, we adopt the direct estimation approach previously used with coarser resolution data, such as MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and apply it to multiple Landsat data obtained by Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), and Operational Land Imager (OLI). By incorporating Landsat spectral response functions and a database of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) into radiative transfer simulations, a unified algorithm is developed to estimate surface albedo directly from the Landsat top-of-atmospheric reflectance data obtained by MSS, TM, ETM +, and OLI with few ancillary inputs. To overcome the saturation problems in the visible bands of TM and ETM + over very bright surfaces, a refined approach is employed by using only non-saturated bands. The validation results against ground measurements over various land cover types and climate regions show that our algorithm is effective for both snow-free and snow-covered surfaces and can achieve root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of not more than 0.034. In addition, we show the high potential of the earlier MSS data for producing consistent surface albedo estimations based on inter-comparison with TM-based results with RMSEs of 0.011-0.017 and R-2 of 0.858-0.963. This long-term, 30-m resolution surface albedo estimation can date back to the early 1980s, which allows for improved understanding of long-term climate change and land cover change effects.

AB Increases in extreme weather events associated with climate change have the potential to put currently healthy forests at risk. One option to minimize this risk is the application of forest management measures aimed at generating species mixtures predicted to be more resilient to these threats. In order to apply such measures appropriately, forest managers need up-to-date, accurate and consistent forest maps at relatively fine spatial resolutions. Cost efficiency is a major factor when creating such maps. Taking European spruce (Picea abies) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) as an example, this paper describes an innovative approach for mapping two tree species using a combination of commercial very high resolution WorldView-2 (WV2) images and Landsat time series data. As a first step, this study used a supervised object-based classification of WV2 images covering relatively small test sites distributed across the region of interest. Using these classification maps as training data, wall-to-wall mapping of fractional coverages of spruce and pine was achieved using multi-temporal Landsat data and Random Forests (RF) regression. The method was applied for the entire state of Bavaria (Germany), which comprises a total forested area of approximately 26,000 km(2). As applied here, this two-step approach yields consistent and accurate maps of fractional tree cover estimates with a spatial resolution of 1 ha. Independent validation of the fractional cover estimates using 3780 reference samples collected through visual interpretation of orthophotos produced root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 11% (for spruce) and 14% (for pine) with almost no bias, and R-2 values of 0.74 and 0.79 for spruce and pine, respectively. The majority of the validation samples (75% (spruce) and 84% (pine)) were modeled within the assumed uncertainty of +/- 15% of the reference sample. Accuracies were significantly better compared to those achieved using a single-step classification of Landsat time series data at the pixel level (30 m), because the two-step approach better captures regional variation in the spectral signatures of target classes. Moreover, the increased number of available reference cells mitigates the impact of occasional errors in the reference data set. This two-step approach has great potential for cost-effective operational mapping of dominant forest types over large areas.

AB Glaciers and ice streams drain the ice from the ice sheets to the ice shelves, and contribute to global sea-level changes. Therefore, ice velocity is an essential parameter for the assessment of mass balance. In this paper, we propose an approach for the multi-track extraction of two-dimensional ice surface velocity by the combined use of multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI) and differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR). The azimuth and ground range ice movements of each individual track are first estimated by the use of MAI and DInSAR, respectively. A seamless two-dimensional ice velocity map is then achieved by calibration andmosaicking of the estimated velocity of the multi-temporal and multi-track measurements over a large area. Finally, the dynamic behavior of the Amery Ice Shelf is analyzed by formulating a long-term series of ice flow velocities consisting of historical surface velocities (1968-1990), the estimated surface velocity by the proposed method with ERS-1/2 data (1996), existing surface velocity products such as the Radarsat-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) velocities (1997-2000) and Rignot's results (2007-2010), as well as the estimated velocities obtained by the use of the offset tracking method from Landsat 8 images (2013-2014). The results show that the estimated velocity obtained by the use of the proposed method is superior to the other methods, and the long-term series of ice velocity measurements shows that the ice velocity in the Amery Ice Shelf has hardly changed over the past 45 years (1968-2014). We conclude that the ice flow velocity of the Amery Ice Shelf has showed a slight deceleration over the past 45 years.

AB Remotely-sensed climate data records (CDRs) provide a basis for spatially distributed global climate model (GCM) inputs and validation methods. GCMs can take advantage of land surface models (LSMs), which aim to resolve surface energy, water and carbon budgets and hence these LSMs present important boundary conditions at the land-atmosphere interface. Pertinently, satellite data assimilation approaches are essential for improved land surface modelling for northern high latitudes ecosystems where permafrost degradation is reported to be ongoing. Permafrost, however, is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) that cannot directly be monitored from space.
   Here, we advocate that CDRs, such as those compiled under the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme, may be used in combination with permafrost models to improve our understanding of permafrost extent and degradation in a changing climate system. We describe the current types of remotely-sensed surface feature products that are widely used as indicators for permafrost related features. Furthermore, we highlight issues of using these site-specific permafrost proxies related to spatial scale, as well as the uncertainties in establishing present-day permafrost extent itself.
   Our assessment of the key ECVs that impact on permafrost, demonstrates how models that incorporate EO CDRs have the potential to boost our knowledge of permafrost conditions through better parametrisation of the thermal regime of permafrost soils. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Microrefugia are sites with stable, high quality habitat within landscapes characterized by dynamic environmental conditions driven by climate variability or ecological disturbances. There is considerable interest in the potential of microrefugia to provide climate change resilience to landscapes and to biodiversity conservation. Although attractive conceptually, there is yet little guidance on how to identify climate change microrefugia in order to study and protect them, and the data required to do so are often lacking. This study demonstrates how time series remote sensing, using all available Landsat images of a study area, can be used to directly detect microrefugia maintained by water subsidies in a semi-arid landscape in southwest Western Australia.
   Microrefugia were identified as pixels with abundant vegetation and consistent vegetation dynamics between wet and dry years. At every pixel, a harmonic model was fit to the intra-annual time series of vegetation index values compiled from the wettest years in the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) archive. This model was then used to predict the phenological cycle of the driest years at that pixel. Candidate microrefugia were defined to be those pixels with (1) high vegetation activity in dry years and (2) highly predictable phenologies that are consistent regardless of the weather conditions experienced in a given year. Spatial relationships between candidate microrefugia and landscape features associated with elevated moisture availability (thought to drive climate microrefugia in these semi-arid landscapes) were assessed. The candidate microrefugia show great promise. Evaluations against high-resolution imagery reveal that candidate microrefugia most likely buffer against drought, although refugia from other disturbances, especially fire, were also detected. In contrast, spatial proxies of the physical features expected to maintain microrefugia failed to adequately represent the distribution of microrefugia across the landscape, likely due to data quality and the heterogeneity of microrefugia. Direct detection of microrefugia with Earth observation data is a promising solution in data limited regions. Landsat time series analyses are well suited to this application as they can characterize both the habitat quality and stability aspects of microrefugia.

AB Sea surface salinity (SSS) retrieved from SMAP radiometer measurements are validated against in situ salinity from Argo floats, tropical moored buoys and ship-based thermosalinograph (TSG) data. SMAP SSS achieved an accuracy of 0.2 PSU on a monthly basis in comparison with Argo gridded data in the tropics and mid-latitudes. In the tropical oceans, time series comparison of salinity measured at 1 m by moored buoys indicates that SMAP can track large salinity changes occurred within a month. Synergetic analysis of SMAP, SMOS and Argo data allows us to identify and exclude erroneous jumps or drift in some real-time buoy data from the assessment of the satellite data. The resulting SMAP-buoy matchup analysis gives an average standard deviation of 0.22 PSU and correlation coefficient of 0.73 on weekly scale. On monthly time scales, the average standard deviation reduced to 0.17 PSU and the correlation coefficient improved to 0.8. SMAP L3 daily maps reveals salty water intrusions from the Arabian Sea into the Bay of Bengal during the Indian summer monsoon, consistent with the daily measurements collected from Argo floats deployed during the Bay of Bengal Boundary Layer Experiment (BoBBLE) project field campaign. In the Mediterranean Sea, the spatial pattern of SSS from SMAP is confirmed by the ship-based TSG. Comparison with individual Argo floats suggests the SMAP retrieval algorithm performs better in the Western Mediterranean region, but suffers from radio-frequency interference (RFI) and land contamination in the Eastern Mediterranean region and Adriatic Sea.

AB This work presents a validation of three satellite-based radiation products over an extensive network of 313 pyranometers across Europe, from 2005 to 2015. The products used have been developed by the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) and are one geostationary climate dataset (SARAH-JRC), one polar-orbiting climate dataset (CLARA-A2) and one geostationary operational product. Further, the ERA-Interim reanalysis is also included in the comparison. The main objective is to determine the quality level of the daily means of CM SAF datasets, identifying their limitations, as well as analyzing the different factors that can interfere in the adequate validation of the products.
   The quality of the pyranometer was the most critical source of uncertainty identified. In this respect, the use of records from Second Class pyranometers and silicon-based photodiodes increased the absolute error and the bias, as well as the dispersion of both metrics, preventing an adequate validation of the daily means. The best spatial estimates for the three datasets were obtained in Central Europe with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) within 8-13 W/m(2), whereas the MAD always increased at high-latitudes, snow-covered surfaces, high mountain ranges and coastal areas. Overall, the SARAH-JRC's accuracy was demonstrated over a dense network of stations making it the most consistent dataset for climate monitoring applications. The operational dataset was comparable to SARAH-JRC in Central Europe, but lacked of the temporal stability of climate datasets, while CLARA-A2 did not achieve the same level of accuracy despite predictions obtained showed high uniformity with a small negative bias. The ERA-Interim reanalysis shows the by-far largest deviations from the surface reference measurements. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Ecosystem water regulation couples energy and water balance, depends on the integrity of the ecosystem, and responds to changes in climate. Changes in tree-water relationships in the biodiversity hotspot of the tropical Andes in southern Ecuador might be potentially observed at the level of individual trees, thus providing an efficient ecosystem monitoring method with applications in forest management and conservation at the tree and landscape levels. In this study, we combine area-average measurements from a laser scintillometer above the forest with optical satellite data at high spatial resolution to obtain area-wide evapotranspiration data. The processing of field data includes the calculation of energy storage in forest biomass and the partitioning of evapotranspiration into transpiration and evaporation. Satellite-based estimates are calibrated by using tower flux measurements and meteorological data within periods of humid and less-humid atmosphere. The annual evapotranspiration was 1316 mm, of which 1086 mm per year corresponds to the forest transpiration at the study site. Average values of 4.7 and 4.1 mm d(-1) per tree crown are observed under humid and less-humid atmospheric conditions, respectively, when applying high-resolution area-wide evapotranspiration in individual crown analysis. Approximately 24% of the observed crowns show a positive monthly change in ET, and 51% of the crowns show a significant change in the daily ET, which can be considered sensitive individuals concerning water relationships. The limitations in the area-wide evapotranspiration at the crown level can be explained by considering the spectral responses of the crown individuals. The presented method can be robustly deployed in the ecological monitoring of mountain forests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A wide range of environmental and societal issues such as food security policy implementation requires accurate information on biomass productivity and its underlying drivers at both regional and local scales. While many studies in West Africa are conducted with coarse resolution earth observation data, few have tried to relate vegetation trends to explanatory factors, as is generally done in land use and land cover change (LULCC) studies at finer scales. In this study we proposed to make a bridge between vegetation trend analysis and LULCC studies to improve the understanding of the various factors that influence the biomass production changes observed in satellite time series (using integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI] as a proxy). The study was conducted in two steps. In the first step we analyzed MODIS NDVI linear trends together with TRMM growing season rainfall over the Sahel region from 2000 to 2015. A classification scheme was proposed that enables better specification of the relative role of the main drivers of biomass production dynamics. We found that 16% of the Sahel is re-greening-but found strong evidence that rainfall is not the only important driver of biomass increase. Moreover, a decrease found in 5% of the Sahel can be chiefly attributed to factors other than rainfall (88%). In the second step, we focused on the "Degre Carre de Niamey" site in Niger. Here, the observed biomass trends were analyzed in relation to land cover changes and a set of potential drivers of LULCC using the Random Forest algorithm. We observed negative trends (29% of the Niger site area) mainly in tiger bush areas located on lateritic plateaus, which are particularly prone to pressures from overgrazing and overlogging. The significant role of accessibility factors in biomass production trends was also highlighted. Our methodological framework may be used to highlight changing areas and their major drivers to identify target areas for more detailed studies. Finer-scale assessments of the long-term vulnerability of populations can then be made to substantiate food security management policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB As a primary disturbance agent, fire significantly influences local processes and services of forest ecosystems. Although a variety of remote sensing based approaches have been developed and applied to Landsat mission imagery to infer burn severity at 30 m spatial resolution, forest burn severity have still been seldom assessed at fine spatial scales (5 m) from very-high-resolution (VHR) data. We assessed a 432 ha forest fire that occurred in April 2012 on Long Island, New York, within the Pine Barrens region, a unique but imperiled fire-dependent ecosystem in the northeastern United States. The mapping of forest burn severity was explored here at fine spatial scales, for the first time using remotely sensed spectral indices and a set of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) fraction images from bi-temporal pre- and post-fire event - WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery at 2 m spatial resolution. We first evaluated our approach using 1 m by 1 m validation points at the sub-crown scale per severity class (i.e. unburned, low, moderate, and high severity) from the post-fire 0.10 m color aerial ortho-photos; then, we validated the burn severity mapping of geo-referenced dominant tree crowns (crown scale) and 15 m by 15 m fixed-area plots (inter-crown scale) with the post-fire 0.10 m aerial ortho-photos and measured crown information of twenty forest inventory plots. Our approach can accurately assess forest burn severity at the sub-crown (overall accuracy is 84% with a Kappa value of 0.77), crown (overall accuracy is 82% with a Kappa value of 0.76), and inter-crown scales (89% of the variation in estimated burn severity ratings (i.e. Geo-Composite Burn Index (CBI)). This work highlights that forest burn severity mapping from VHR data can capture heterogeneous fire patterns at fine spatial scales over the large spatial extents. This is important since most ecological processes associated with fire effects vary at the <30 m scale and VHR approaches could significantly advance our ability to characterize fire effects on forest ecosystems.

AB Accurate information on the gross primary production (GPP) of paddy rice cropland is critical for assessing and monitoring rice growing conditions. The eddy co-variance technique was used to measure net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 between paddy rice croplands and the atmosphere, and the resultant NEE data then partitioned into GPP (GPP(Ec)) and ecosystem respiration. In this study, we first used the GPP(Ec) data from four paddy rice flux tower sites in South Korea, Japan and the USA to evaluate the biophysical performance of three vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) in terms of phenology (crop growing seasons) and GPP(Ec), which are derived from images taken by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. We also ran the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), which is driven by EVI, LSWI, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and air temperature, to estimate GPP over multiple years at these four sites (GPP(VPM)). The 14 site-years of simulations show that the seasonal dynamics of GPP(VPM) successfully tracked the seasonal dynamics of GPPEc (R-2 > 0.88 or higher). The cross-site comparison also shows that GPP(VPM) agreed reasonably well with the variations of GPP(Ec) across both years and sites. The simulation results clearly demonstrate the potential of the VPM model and MODIS images for estimating GPP of paddy rice croplands in the monsoon climates of South Korea and Japan and the Mediterranean climate in California, USA. The application of VPM to regional simulations in the near future may provide crucial GPP data to support the studies of food security and cropland carbon cycle around the world.

AB The high levels of uncertainty associated with earthquake prediction render earthquakes some of the worst natural calamities. Here, we present our observations of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) anomaly for earthquakes in the largest tectonically active Himalayan and Andean mountain belts. We report the appearance of fairly detectable pre-earthquake Snow Surface Temperature (SST) anomalies. We use 16 years (2000-2015) of MODIS CST time-series data to robustly conclude our findings for three of the most destructive earthquakes that occurred in 2015 in the high mountains of Nepal, Chile, and Afghanistan. We propose the physical basis behind higher sensitivity of snow towards geothermal emissions. Although the preliminary appearance of SST anomalies and their amplitudes vary, we propose employing a global-scale monitoring system for detecting and studying such spatio-temporal geophysical signals. With the advent of improved remote sensors, we anticipate that such efforts can be another step towards improved earthquake predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study compared the densest available database of tree-ring growth with the longest Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) information available at the global scale to quantify the relationship between annual forest growth and the NDVI across different forest types and regions and to characterize the patterns of response of forest growth to NDVI values at different temporal scales. We found a general positive relationship between the inter-annual NDVI variability and the annual tree growth in most of the analyzed forests. Nevertheless, there were strong differences in the tree growth responses to NDVI, given that the annual tree-ring records in each forest responded in a different way to the magnitude, seasonality and accumulation period of the NDVI values. Thus, we found eight main patterns of tree-ring response to the NDVI, which were related to the forest type and climate conditions of each corresponding site. The identified patterns may be useful for determining early-warning signals of changes in forest growth over large areas based on remote sensing information. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB The loss of tropical forests threatens a broad range of ecosystem services. Particularly, tropical deforestation is a major driver of biodiversity decline and substantial carbon emissions. Regrowth of secondary vegetation may help to restore habitat for many threatened species and improve ecosystem services that deteriorated due to deforestation. However, spatial-temporal patterns of regrowing secondary vegetation in the tropics remain weakly understood. We therefore analyze regrowth dynamics across two different land use systems in southern Amazonia: the extensive pastoralism in Para and the capital-intensive agriculture in Mato Grosso. Both systems are connected by the BR-163 highway, which represents a major axis of deforestation and agricultural development in the Brazilian Amazon since decades. We used a 29 year time series of Landsat images to extract regrowth extent, duration, lag time between deforestation and regrowth, and frequency of regrowth cycles. Our results reached an overall accuracy of 89% and showed regrowth on up to 50% of the deforested area in Para and a maximum of 25% in Mato Grosso. In both states, annual regrowth rates drastically dropped after 1996, which coincided with socioeconomic transformations and drought events. The majority of regrowth was concentrated within 60 m distance to forest edges and cleared again after an average of 5 years. Our approach bears great potential for mapping post deforestation regrowth dynamics within and beyond the Brazilian Amazon based on long-term and freely accessible remote sensing data collections, such as the Landsat and the forthcoming Sentinel-2 archives.

AB Quantifying Colored Detrital Matter (CDM) from satellite observations can improve our knowledge of carbon dynamics in coastal areas and the open oceans. Several bio-optical inversion models have been developed for this purpose. However, care must be taken when they are applied to waters where optical properties significantly differ from model assumptions, which is the case in the Mediterranean Sea. Algorithm testing and validation are thus required before routine use. Here, in situ radiometric measurements collected in the NW Mediterranean Sea (BOUSSOLE site) are used to evaluate three bio-optical inversion models that retrieve the CDM light absorption coefficients at 443 nm (a(cdm)(443)). Although all methods reproduced the CDM seasonal cycles at the surface, comparisons of predicted and in situ acdm(443) coefficients showed that the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm version 6 (QAAv6) and a locally-adapted version of the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena model (GSM-Med) were the two best algorithms. Applying these two models to SeaWiFS remote sensing reflectances, collected between 2003 and 2010, reproduced with good accuracy the acdm(443) coefficients retrieved from field radiometric measurements at the BOUSSOLE site, with seasonal patterns consistent with previous observations. Finally, bio-optical relationships derived from satellite-retrieved a(cdm)(443) and chlorophyll values confirmed the higher-than-average CDM contribution for a given chlorophyll concentration in the Mediterranean Sea as compared to many oceanic regions.

AB The effects of climate change are more acute in the Arctic than any other region, and as such, arctic tundra wildlife habitats are changing in ways that are not yet well understood. Remote sensing tools are capable of assessing dynamics in wildlife-habitat associations over a wide range of spatial scales and in a variety of ecosystems. As already well-established in other ecosystems, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDaR) technology has the potential to greatly expand our understanding of tundra wildlife-habitat associations because unlike the most commonly used spectral vegetation index - the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) - LiDaR directly quantifies three-dimensional (3-D) vegetation structure. Only recently has airborne laser scanning (ALS) technology evolved to having vertical resolution and point densities high enough to quantify small differences in vegetation structure, such as characterize arctic tundra ecosystems. Our objective was to employ ALS metrics, airborne spectral data (for NDVI), and Landsat 7 ETM + data (for snow cover) to determine the relative importance of a suite of ecological characteristics - considered at multiple spatial scales - on habitat use and reproductive success of two of the most common migratory songbird species breeding in northern Alaska. Our most important findings are that (1) combining ALS metrics, but not NDVI, with Landsat derived snow cover data provided useful information, revealing that while Gambel's white-crowned sparrows use breeding territories in areas with high canopy volume and large snow-free areas, Lapland longspurs will establish territories in areas with low canopy volume, small patches of snow-free tundra, and minimal surface wetness and; (2) while habitat characteristics were important determinants of habitat use for both species at the territory scale, those in the immediate vicinity of nest sites were not important. Contrary to expectation, we also found that the reproductive success of both species was unaffected by variation in our hypothesized metrics of shelter and food availability (canopy volume, standard deviation of micro-terrain height) at both the nest-site or territory scales. Our study is the first arctic demonstration of how ALS yields novel insights into wildlife-habitat associations, suggesting it has great potential in other ecosystems with similarly small - yet often ecologically important - ranges in 3-D vegetation structure.

AB The April 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill was the largest coastal spill in U.S. history. Monitoring subsequent change in marsh plant community distributions is critical to assess ecosystem impacts and to establish future coastal management priorities. Strategically deployed airborne imaging spectrometers, like the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), offer the spectral and spatial resolution needed to differentiate plant species. However, obtaining satisfactory and consistent classification accuracies over time is a major challenge, particularly in dynamic intertidal landscapes.
   Here, we develop and evaluate an image classification system for a time series of AVIRIS data for mapping dominant species in a heavily oiled salt marsh ecosystem. Using field-referenced image endmembers and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA), we classified 21 AVIRIS images acquired during the fall of 2010, 2011 and 2012. Classification results were evaluated using ground surveys that were conducted contemporaneously to AVIRIS collection dates. We analyzed changes in dominant species cover from 2010 to 2012 for oiled and non-oiled shorelines.
   CDA discriminated dominant species with a high level of accuracy (overall accuracy = 82%, kappa = 0.78) and consistency over three imaging dates (overall(2010) = 82%, overall(2011) = 82%, overall(2012) = 88%). Marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora were the most spatially abundant in shoreline zones (<= 28 m from shore) for all three dates (2010 = 79%, 2011 = 61%, 2012 = 63%), followed by Juncus roemerianus (2010 = 11%, 2011 = 19%, 2012 = 17%) and Distichlis spicata (2010 = 4%, 2011 = 10%, 2012 = 7%).
   Marshes that were heavily contaminated with oil exhibited variable responses from 2010 to 2012. Marsh vegetation classes converted to a subtidal, open water class along oiled and non-oiled shorelines that were similarly situated in the landscape. However, marsh loss along oil-contaminated shorelines doubled that of non-oiled shorelines. Only S. alterniflora dominated marshes were extensively degraded, losing 15% (354,604 m(2)) cover in oiled shoreline zones, suggesting that S. alterniflora marshes may be more vulnerable to shoreline erosion following hydrocarbon stress, due to their landscape position.

AB Understanding of the Agulhas Current's unique retroflection and ring shedding has been greatly improved by satellite altimetry data over the last several decades, but salinity remote sensing technology has not been available to conduct similar studies with respect to regional sea surface salinity (SSS) variability. ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and NASA's Aquarius/SAC-D salinity missions can provide such data, but it remains unclear if the accuracy of these sensors is high enough to properly study this dynamic region. To address this issue, this study validates both SMOS and Aquarius against monthly in situ data from Argo floats. All available, corresponding data points over a three year period have root mean square differences less than 0.2 pss and correlation coefficients greater than 0.9. Additionally, over 80% of differences between the products fall between +/- 0.5 pss. Surface salt transports were calculated to see how well the satellite products estimate SSS advection in the Agulhas region. Zonal and meridional surface salt transports have annual maxima in austral winter and minima in austral summer, although the seasonal range is small. Using Argo, SMOS, and Aquarius SSS for this calculation produces statistically identical results, suggesting the utility of using the satellites to monitor regional salinity advection at higher frequencies and horizontal resolutions than previously possible using only sparse in situ data. SSS gradients along the subtropical front reveal that SMOS and Aquarius are much more effective tools for observing small-scale structure prevalent in the meandering of the Agulhas Return Current. Finally, we conclude that when compared to Argo floats in situ observations SMOS and Aquarius are statistically accurate and may yet prove powerful tools for observing Agulhas salinity processes on smaller time and spatial scales.

AB Insect defoliation causes forest disturbances with complex spatial dynamics. In order to monitor affected areas, decision makers seek but often lack information with high spatial and temporal precision. Within the context of a riparian Tugai forest disturbed by the insect Apocheima cinerarius, this study examines whether the analysis of a RapidEye time series would benefit from the availability of synthetically generated images at the spatial resolution of RapidEye and the additional temporal resolution of Landsat 8. We applied the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) to downscale Landsat 8 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) scenes to concurrent RapidEye NDVI scenes. We a) performed a pixel-based regression analyses in order to evaluate the quality of the synthetically created NDVI products and b) examined if forest disturbance maps produced with synthetic images improve the accuracy of disturbance detection. The results show that the ESTARFM predictions have a sufficiently good accuracy, with a correlation coefficient between 0.878 < r < 0.919 (p < 0.001) and an average root mean square error 0.015 < RMSE < 0.024. The overall accuracy of forest disturbance detection with added synthetic images increased from 42.8% to 61.1 & 65.7% compared to the original data set. Forest recovery detection accuracy improved from 59.5% to 80.9%. The main source of error in the disturbance analysis occurs during the temporal interweaving between foliation and defoliation in spring. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite derived surface albedo and view-angle corrected surface reflectance products serve as the key inputs for an array of climate, biogeochemical, and hydrologic modeling efforts. This research effort is particularly focused on establishing the effective spatial resolution of the global MODIS and VIIRS Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and Albedo products. The standard MODIS Products (MCD43) are created by fitting a kernel-driven, semi-empirical BRDF model to multi-date, multi-angular surface reflectance data to establish the surface reflectance anisotropy of a location. Emphasis on a particular date within the rolling multi-date period has resulted in a daily product reported on a 500 m Sinusoidal grid tiling system. While anecdotal and theoretical experiences have suggested that this product would be representative of a larger surface area than the 500 m grid, this research both quantifies that effect, and verifies that the spatial effective resolution is consistently less than 1 km for MODIS. Results for 500 m VIIRS NBAR product show an improvement of approximately 250 m in spatial effective resolution along the scan direction. In addition to their use in modeling, the MODIS BRDF/Albedo/NBAR products (and into the future with the analogous VIIRS products) are increasingly being relied upon to monitor vegetation phenology, identify land cover and land cover disturbance, track snow fall and melt, and establish surface energy balance variability. Thus, this research provides the quantification both for MODIS and VIIRS necessary for the effective use of these products by the global modeling and monitoring communities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Abundance, size, and spatial distribution of standing dead trees (snags), are key indicators of forest biodiversity and ecosystem health. These metrics represent critical habitat components for various wildlife species of conservation concern, including the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), which is strongly associated with recently burned conifer forest. We assessed the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) to detect and characterize conifer snags and identify Black-backed Woodpecker habitat using previously derived empirical thresholds of conifer snag basal area. Over the footprint of the Rim Fire, a megafire that extended (similar to 104,000 ha) through a heterogeneous mosaic of conifer forests, oak woodlands, and meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, we identified conifer snags and estimated their basal area from single-tree ALS-derived metrics using Gaussian processes in four major steps. First, individual trees were mapped using the Watershed Segmentation algorithm, resulting in 87% detection of trees with stem diameter larger than 30 cm. Second, the snag/live classification model identified snags with an overall accuracy of 91.8%, using the coefficient of variation of height and intensity together with maximum intensity and fractional cover as the most relevant metrics. Third, the conifer/hardwood snag classification model utilizing the maximum height, median height, minimum intensity, and area metrics separated snag forest types with an overall accuracy of 84.8%. Finally, a Gaussian process regression model reliably estimated conifer snag stem diameter (R-2 = 0.81) using height and crown area, thus significantly outperforming regionally calibrated conifer-specific allometric equations. As a result,-80% of the snag basal area have been mapped. Optimal and potential habitat for Black-backed Woodpecker comprise 53.7 km(2) and 58.4 km(2), respectively, representing 5.1 and 5.6% of the footprint of the Rim Fire. Our study illustrates the utility of high-density ALS data for characterizing recently burned forests, which, in conjunction with information about the habitat needs of particular snag-dependent wildlife species, can be used to assess habitat characteristics, and thus contribute greatly to forest management and biodiversity conservation.

AB Single-day snow covered area (SCA) products are incomplete and often inadequate representations of ground conditions due to short term variation in cloud cover, snow cover, and sensor geometry. To mitigate these effects, we developed a by-pixel filtering algorithm to produce relatively cloud-free SCA products from 16 days of MODIS imagery. The algorithm uses previous days' data to estimate the current SCA value of each pixel and uses a simple persistence test to reduce the effects of spurious SCA/cloud classifications in the input products. To be positively identified as SCA, a pixel must be snow-covered in the two most recent, cloud-free scenes of the 16-day period. We applied this time-domain-filtering (TDF) methodology to two single-day MODIS fractional snow cover products (MOD10A1 and MODSCAG) over the MODIS period of record (2000-present) and compared the outputs to the unfiltered products, to filtered maps generated using the cloud-gap-filled algorithm (CGF, Hall et al., 2010), and to historical snow assessment reports from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL). The CRREL reports were manually generated and quality-controlled by an analyst and are treated as ground truth. We find that, when applied to MODSCAG, the TDF algorithm successfully fills in gap pixels and limits the effects of snow/cloud confusion and produces a filtered product that is more consistent and accurate than the MODSCAG CGF product and comparable to the MOD10A1 CGF product.

AB The 2SeaColor model (Salama & Verhoef, 2015) was proposed to analytically retrieve the diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) from remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), but its parameterization was based on approximations and subjected to large uncertainties. In this study, we present an improvement on the parameterization equations in the inverse scheme of the 2Seacolor model. The improved model is then validated with three in-situ datasets and compared with the Zhang model (Zhang & Fell, 2007) and the Lee model (Lee, Darecki et al., 2005). Validation with radiometric data shows that the 2SeaColor model provides the best estimates of K-d for the full range of observations, with the largest determination coefficient (R-2 = 0.935) and the smallest root mean squared error (RMSE = 0.078 m(-1)). For clear waters, where K-d(490) < 0.2, the Zhang model provides the most accurate K-d estimations, but results from the Lee model and the 2SeaColor are rather comparable. For turbid waters, where K-d(490) > 0.2 m(-1), the 2SeaColor model is found to be more accurate, with an RMSE of 0.186 m(-1), compared to RMSEs of 0279 m(-1) and 0388 m(-1) for the Zhang model and the Lee model, respectively.
   The 2SeaColor model is finally applied to the GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) level 2 product (L2P) to produce K-d maps over the Yangtze Estuary, resulting in a reasonable distribution and expected range of K-d, as for example K-d(490) was varying from 0.04 to 9.82 m(-1) for the image acquired at 02:16 UTC, on March 8th 2013. The analytical 2SeaColor model is able to provide consistently stable and fairly accurate K-d estimates in both clear and turbid waters without the need of tuning empirical coefficients from field measurements, and thus has great potential for estimating K-d over optically complex waters.

AB We investigated the spectral refractive indices (RIs) of volcanic ash materials in the wavenumber range of 700-1100 cm(-1) using satellite infrared sounder measurements and radiative transfer calculations. The ash RIs of 10 ash clouds from eight volcanoes were evaluated (Bezymianny on 2 September 2012, Chaiten on 3 May 2008, Kelut on 14 February 2014, Kirishimayama on 27 January 2011, Kliuchevskoi on 30 June 2007 and 18 October 2013, Puyehue-Cordon Caulle on 5 June 2011, Sangeang-Api on 31 May 2014, and Sheveluch on 28 October 2010 and 18 September 2012). We elaborated on a dataset of volcanic ash measurements made by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) onboard the Aqua satellite. The measured brightness temperatures in the ash cloud data revealed silicate absorption features at around 10 pm. By applying atmospheric profiles from results of a global data assimilation system and using ash cloud properties (ash optical depth, effective radius, and ash cloud height) as parameters for radiative transfer calculations, least squares analyses for the observed and calculated brightness temperatures were conducted using AIRS channels in the wavenumber range of 700-1100 cm(-1), except for the 03 absorption channels in the range of 980-1070 cm(-1). Using the Ms for typical volcanic rocks in the ascending order of SiO2 content, basalt, andesite, and rhyolite, a mixture of basalt and rhyolite and a mixture of andesite and rhyolite for the ash material were considered. The volume fraction of the mixture was used as a retrieval parameter and as the ash cloud parameter. Using the estimated ash cloud parameters as fixed values, and under the assumption that the RI from the estimated volume fraction had some accuracy in the wavenumber ranges of 850-980 cm(-1) and 1070-1100 cm(-1), the RI imaginary part of each eruptive ash cloud captured by AIRS was then determined from iterative calculations at wavenumbers between 750 cm(-1) and 980 cm(-1). In the wavenumber range of 850-980 cm(-1), the observed brightness temperatures could be approximately simulated using the reported Ms from Pollack, Toon, and Khare (1973) for andesite, basalt, and rhyolite, and their combinations. Furthermore, some estimated Ms were consistent with the reported rock types of the volcanoes, which had been previously classified by compositional analyses in the literature. Our analysis also identified weak absorptions around 750-850 cm(-1), which could not be reproduced by the reported Ms. These weak absorptions were likely due to Si-O and/or Al-O vibrations, which have been proposed in reports from previous laboratory experiments for some silicate glass samples. Our results suggest that the detailed RI of volcanic ash can be determined from an analysis of satellite infrared sounder data. The RI of the ash material estimated from satellite infrared sounder data can be used to improve the ash retrieval algorithms of other satellite measurements. Furthermore, an RI retrieved by sounder measurements may provide diagnostic information regarding volcanic activity from comparisons with the ash Ms from past eruptions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB Due to the availability of good and reasonably priced auxiliary data, the use of model-based regression-synthetic estimators for small area estimation is popular in operational settings. Examples are forest management inventories, where a linking model is used in combination with airborne laser scanning data to estimate stand-level forest parameters where no or too few observations are collected within the stand. This paper focuses on different approaches to estimating the variances of those estimates. We compared a variance estimator which is based on the estimation of superpopulation parameters with variance estimators which are based on predictions of finite population values. One of the latter variance estimators considered the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals whereas the other one did not. The estimators were applied using timber volume on stand level as the variable of interest and photogrammetric image matching data as auxiliary information. Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NFI) data were used for model calibration and independent data clustered within stands were used for validation. The empirical coverage proportion (ECP) of confidence intervals (CIs) of the variance estimators which are based on predictions of finite population values was considerably higher than the ECP of the CI of the variance estimator which is based on the estimation of superpopulation parameters. The ECP further increased when considering the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals. The study also explores the link between confidence intervals that are based on variance estimates as well as the well-known confidence and prediction intervals of regression models. 2015 The Authors.

AB Between January 26 and 27, 2011, Shinmoedake volcano, located in the Krishima complex in Kyushu, Japan, produced a number of explosive eruptions with ash clouds reaching up to 85 km above sea level. Volcanic ash (VA) plumes from those eruptions affected the population near the volcano and posed a significant threat to aviation. Since its launch on June 27, 2010, the Meteorological Imager (MI) onboard Korea's first geostationary meteorological satellite, the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), has provided time-resolved images (less than 27-minute intervals for the full disk) at 1 km spatial resolution for the visible (VIS) channel and 4 km spatial resolution for the four infrared (IR) channels. In this study, MI operational data with one broadband VIS channel (centered at 0.68 mu m) and three IR channels (centered at 3.7,10.8, and 12.0 mu m) for eruption events occurring at Shinmoedake were analyzed using the formerly developed hybrid VA detection and retrieval algorithm. We analyzed time-resolved VA plumes produced during three subplinian eruptions and found that spatio-temporal distributions of VA pixels determined by this analysis agreed with the source-receptor regions in meteorological trajectory modeling as well as with the operational products from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), Scanning Imaging Absorption spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIAMACHY), and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). For the three subplinian eruptions, VA retrieval results revealed that the maximum total ash mass loadings were 115.1, 1309.7, and 513 t, and the maximum height reached by the ash clouds were 5.6 +/- 0.7, 10.2 +/- 2.4, and 5.6 +/- 0.8 km, respectively. These values imply that the second eruption emitted the largest amount of VA into the atmosphere. Overall, this is the first study that has been conducted to detect VA using the COMS/MI observations, which have been determined to provide reliable estimates of VA.

AB Geometrically explicit parameterizations of the locations, orientations and properties of trees and canopy elements are useful for forest ecosystem modeling. Detailed reconstructions based on real tree geometry are, however, hard to obtain based on conventional field measurements and sampling. We describe and evaluate an alternative approach to reconstruct the forest canopy from sparse, leaf-off airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with a wall-to-wall coverage. The approach employs computational geometry and topological connectivity to generate filtrations, i.e., ordered sets of simplices belonging to the three-dimensional (3D) triangulations of the point data, and numerical optimization to select the set of simplices with a quasi-optimal relationship with field measured forest biophysical attributes. The approach was evaluated by predicting the quantities and spatial patterns of biomass-related forest attributes according to the characteristics of the filtration. When the filtration parameters were optimized for 245 sample plots of 300 m(2) located in southern boreal forest in Finland, the coefficients of determination (R-2) between total volumes of the filtrations and basal area, stem volume, total above-ground biomass, and canopy biomass were 0.93, 0.87, 0.87, and 0.62, respectively. Considerably less accurate results (R-2 = 0.44-0.64) were obtained when the filtration parameters were predicted with a limited number of the calibration field plots. However, these accuracies could be obtained with modest field training data of 20-30 plots. The proposed approach is a compromise between the parameterization of the forest scene by artificial tree/crown level turbid media and realistic 3D models. The results particularly suggest that obtaining coarse wall-to-wall descriptions does not require separate data acquisitions, but may be based on data existing due to previous practical inventories.

AB Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is a ubiquitous phytoplankton metabolite and the main precursor of the climate-active gas dimethylsulfide (DMS) in the oceans' surface. Here we use total DMSP (DMSPt) and ancillary measurements from a global database to develop a remote sensing algorithm for DMSPt in the upper mixed layer (UML). Over 55% of total DMSPt variability (log(10) scale) is explained by in situ chlorophyll a (Chl) after dividing the database into two subsets, according to "stratified" and "mixed" water column criteria, based on the ratio between euphotic layer depth (Z(eu)) and mixed layer depth (MLD). Up to 70% of the variability is explained when adding sea surface temperature (SST) and log(10)(Z(eu)/MLD) as predictors for the stratified and mixed subsets, respectively. Independent validation on satellite Chl match-ups indicates that the algorithm predicts DMSPt across three orders of magnitude with a root-mean-squared error spanning from 0.20 to 0.26 (log(10) space) and mean absolute error typically around 45% (linear space). An additional submodel based on remotely sensed particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) is used to predict DMSPt in coccolithophore blooms if satellite Chl is not available. We use the algorithm to produce a monthly global DMSPt climatology, and estimate that DMSP synthesis amounts to 5-9% of oceanic phytoplankton gross carbon production. Our algorithm provides a new remote sensing tool for resolving temporal and spatial variations in DMSPt concentration, and represents a step forward toward improved diagnosis of contemporary DMS emission based on satellite Earth observation.

AB Accurately estimating aboveground vegetation biomass productivity is essential for local ecosystem assessment and best land management practice. Satellite-derived growing season time-integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GSN) has been used as a proxy for vegetation biomass productivity. A 250-m grassland biomass productivity map for the Greater Platte River Basin had been developed based on the relationship between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GSN and Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) annual grassland productivity. However, the 250-m MODIS grassland biomass productivity map does not capture detailed ecological features (or patterns) and may result in only generalized estimation of the regional total productivity. Developing a high or moderate spatial resolution (e.g., 30-m) productivity map to better understand the regional detailed vegetation condition and ecosystem services is preferred. The 30-m Landsat data provide spatial detail for characterizing human-scale processes and have been successfully used for land cover and land change studies. The main goal of this study is to develop a 30-m grassland biomass productivity estimation map for central Nebraska, leveraging 250-m MODIS GSN and 30-m Landsat data. A rule-based piecewise regression GSN model based on MODIS and Landsat (r = 0.91) was developed, and a 30-m MODIS equivalent GSN map was generated. Finally, a 30-m grassland biomass productivity estimation map, which provides spatially detailed ecological features and conditions for central Nebraska, was produced. The resulting 30-m grassland productivity map was generally supported by the SSURGO biomass production map and will be useful for regional ecosystem study and local land management practices.

AB Airborne thermal infrared (TIR) overflights were combined with shoreline radionuclide surveys to investigate submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) along the north shore of Long Island, NY between June 2013 and September 2014. Regression equations developed for three distinct geomorphological environments suggest a positive linear relationship between the rate of diffuse SGD and the spatial extent of the observed coastal TIR anomalies; such a relationship provides quantitative evidence of the ability to use TIR remote sensing as a tool to remotely identify and measure SGD. Landsat TIR scenes were unable to resolve any of the 18 TIR anomalies identified during the various airborne overflights. Two locations were studied in greater detail via Rn-222 time series and manual seepage meters in order to understand why specific shoreline segments did not exhibit a TIR anomaly. SGD at the first site, located within a large, diffuse TIR anomaly, was composed of a mixture of fresh groundwater and circulated seawater with elevated levels of nitrate. In contrast, SGD at the second site, where no coastal TIR anomaly was observed, was composed of circulated seawater with negligible nitrate. Despite the compositional differences in seepage, both sites were similar in discharge magnitude, with average time series Rn-222 derived SGD rates equal to 18 and 8 cm d(-1) for the TIR site and non-TIR site, respectively. Results suggest that TIR remote sensing has the ability to identify locations of a mixture between diffuse fresh and circulated seawater SGD. If TIR anomalies can be demonstrated to represent a mixture between fresh and circulated seawater SGD, then the cumulative area of the TIR anomalies may be used to estimate the fresh fraction of SGD relative to the cumulative area of the seepage face, and thus allows for improved SGD derived nutrient flux calculations on a regional scale.

AB Macrophytes are important components of freshwater ecosystems, playing a relevant role in carbon and nutrient cycles. Notwithstanding their widespread diffusion in temperate to subtropical shallow lakes, little effort has been performed so far in extensively mapping macrophyte communities at regional to continental scale. A rule-based classification scheme was implemented for mapping four macrophyte community types (helophyte, emergent rhizophyte, floating, and submerged-floating association). Input features were selected among multi-spectral reflectance and multi-temporal vegetation indices, based on Landsat data acquired over four test sites: Lake Taihu (China), Kis-Balaton wetland (Hungary), Lake Trasimeno and Mantua Lakes system (Italy). The best performing features were derived from Water Adjusted Vegetation Index (WAVI) computed at: early spring, maximum growth, and late autumn conditions. Overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (k) of macrophyte maps produced with our approach over the ensemble of four sites were 90.1% and 0.865, respectively, with best performance in European temperate areas (OA = 93.6-94.2%, k = 0.887-0.916), and lower scores for subtropical Lake Taihu (OA = 82.8%, k = 0.762). Per-class accuracies were higher than 80% for all target classes, except for the submerged-floating association, with misclassifications concentrated in Taihu site. The robustness of the approach was tested over two independent validation cases: a different site (i.e. Lake Varese, Italy), and a different input dataset (i.e. AVNIR-2 data, for Mantua Lakes system). Consistent accuracy results were achieved: OA = 94.3% (k = 0.922) and OA = 85.6% (k = 0.766), with some misclassification due to spatial resolution of AVNIR-2 data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The satellite differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) technology has been widely applied for mapping the ground deformation associated with the geophysical events such as earthquakes. However, the conventional DInSAR can measure only the one-dimensional (1D) ground displacement along the radar line of sight (LOS), and the crucial displacement measurements, e.g., near the epicenter and along the surface ruptures, are usually not available or degraded in quality due to the significant deformation gradients. With availability of satellite SAR images acquired along ascending and descending orbits, this paper proposes an integrated method to map the three-dimensional (3D) coseismic deformation field by combining DInSAR for detecting LOS displacements, the multiple aperture interferometry (MAI) for detecting along-track displacements, and the displacement gradient tensor (DGT) model for characterizing spatial correlation of ground displacements. The proposed method (termed as InSAR-DGT) was first tested through an experiment of recovering 3D displacements from a simulated coseismic deformation field. We then applied the proposed method to map the 3D coseismic deformation field related to the 2011 Tarlay earthquake (Myanmar) by using the ascending and descending ALOS PALSAR images. Both the results derived for the simulated experiment and the 2011 Tarlay earthquake show that the quality of the 3D coseismic displacements can be raised efficiently by the InSAR-DGT method, and the precisions in the east-west (E-W), north-south (N-S) and up-down (U-D) displacements for the 2011 Tarlay earthquake are increased 22%, 36% and 24%, respectively. The validation indicates that the improved coseismic deformation field for the 2011 Tarlay earthquake is in good agreement with the deformation field simulated from the existing optimized fault model. The number of the missing data points in the 3D coseismic deformation field can be reduced significantly by the InSAR-DGT method. It is revealed that the causative fault (i.e., the west part of the Nam Ma Fault) for the Tarlay earthquake generated a left-lateral slip that was accompanied by a minor normal dip-slip component. The careful interpretation demonstrates that the causative fault structures include the determined main fault segment and the two suspected branched segments at east of the Tarlay town.

TI Correction of dust event frequency from MODIS Quick-Look imagery using

AB Subjective visual interpretation of MODIS Quick-Look imagery has proven useful in characterising dust source geomorphology and dust event frequency over diverse areas, but is limited by the small temporal sampling window of polar orbiting platforms, and obscuration by cloud. In this paper we seek to quantify the inevitable under-reporting of dust events in Quick-Look imagery, via a three-year case study over the Lake Eyre Basin (LEB), the largest dust source in Australia and the southern hemisphere. Dust event identification from MODIS imagery is compared with the level of dust mobilization inferred from measurements of near-surface aerosol made by a continuously-operating integrating nephelometer, located at the AeroSpan/AERONET station at Tinga Tingana in the Strzelecki Desert, adjacent to major dust sources in the LEB. The analysis indicates a major upward revision in the overall dust event frequency by -72%, including a doubling of the incidence of major dust outbreaks. The intensity of missed events increases toward late afternoon and evening, although without a net day-night bias. These factors suggest the potential of new geostationary sensors and the analysis of night-time polar orbiting imagery in improving the reporting of dust mobilization over active dust-source regions. For the LEB, the corrections are crucial in understanding not only the seasonal distribution of dust mobilization, but its interannual variability and climatology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Snow provides a key water source for stream flow and agricultural production across western North America and drinking water for large populations in the Southwest. Accurate estimates of snow cover spatial distribution and temporal dynamics are important at regional and local scales as snow cover is projected to decrease due to global climate change. We examined regional-scale temporal trends in snow distribution across central and northern Arizona using two tiles of 2928 daily images of MOD10 snow product. The analysis included the entire MODIS archive time period, October 1,2003-June 1, 2014, and a 245,041 km(2) area of 51 HUC8 watersheds. We also examined the effects of a regional forest restoration effort, known as the Four Forest Restoration Initiative (4FRI), aimed at enhancing snow accumulation and retention for increased groundwater recharge through forest thinning and burning treatments. We analyzed 66 Landsat TM/ETM + images spanning 26 years between 1988 and 2014 at five sites and one hyperspectral image from 2014 at two sites. The MOD10 snow product performs well in estimating Arizona's thin and discontinuous snow distribution. Mann-Kendall time-series analysis indicate significantly increasing trends in the annual number of snow cover days (SCD) over the 12-year period in 1.6% of the region at elevation transitions such as the Mogollon Rim in central Arizona, while significantly decreasing trends are observed at a few locations of lower elevations leading to the desert margins in eastern Arizona. The observed temporal trends are mostly consistent with ground-based SNOTEL snow measurements. An Arizona specific, Landsat sensor-derived binary classification model, similar to the MOD10 product, was developed at a local scale. It performs better than commonly-used simple threshold-based approaches, but demonstrates the continued challenges associated with Landsat sensor-derived snow classification in Arizona likely due to its coarse temporal resolution. Landsat-derived multi-temporal Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) analysis indicate that treated (thinned and thinned-and-burned) forest sites had significantly greater NDSI values than untreated control sites. Snowpack at treated sites also appeared to persist longer into the spring season with potentially greater contributions to groundwater recharge in this semi-arid region. The high-resolution hyperspectral data analysis indicate that sites treated to approximately 24% forest canopy cover appear to have an optimum threshold for accumulating and maintaining snowpack. It balances canopy cover versus canopy gap, which reduces snow interception and sublimation by canopy, while providing enough shade. These results are encouraging for the 4FRI, the first and largest forest restoration effort in the US history, aimed at improving watershed health and function in the face of changing climate.

AB This work presents a new observational wind atlas for the Great Lakes, and proposes a methodology to combine in situ and satellite wind observations for offshore wind resource assessment. Efficient wind energy projects rely on accurate wind resource estimates, which are complex to obtain offshore due to the temporal and spatial sparseness of observations, and the potential for temporal data gaps introduced by the formation of ice during winter months, especially in freshwater lakes. For this study, in situ observations from 70 coastal stations and 20 buoys provide diurnal, seasonal, and interannual wind variability information, with time series that range from 3 to 11 years in duration. Remotely-sensed equivalent neutral winds provide spatial information on the wind climate. NASA QuikSCAT winds are temporally consistent at a 25 km resolution. ESA Synthetic Aperture Radar winds are temporally sparse but at a resolution of 500 m. As an initial step, each data set is processed independently to create a map of 90 m wind speeds. Buoy data are corrected for ice season gaps using ratios of the mean and mean cubed of the Weibull distribution, and reference temporally-complete time series from the North American Regional Reanalysis. Generalized wind climates are obtained for each buoy and coastal site with the wind model WAsP, and combined into a single wind speed estimate for the Great Lakes region. The method of classes is used to account for the temporal sparseness in the SAR data set and combine all scenes into one wind speed map. QuikSCAT winds undergo a seasonal correction due to lack of data during the cold season that is based on its ratio relative to buoy time series. All processing steps reduce the biases of the individual maps relative to the buoy observed wind climates. The remote sensing maps are combined by using QuikSCAT to scale the magnitude of the SAR map. Finally, the in situ predicted wind speeds are incorporated. The mean spatial bias of the final map when compared to buoy time series is 0.1 ms(-1) and the RMSE 03 ms(-1), which represents an uncertainty reduction of 50% relative to using only SAR, and of 40% to using only SAR and QuikSCAT without in situ observations.

AB Glaciers in the northwestern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) including the Karakoram and western Kunlun Mountains (WKM) exhibited heterogeneous changes in recent years. A latest glacier inventory of the WKM region is generated by using Landsat 8/OLI images (year 2013) and SRTM3 DEM. The ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) elevation data in combination with the DEM is then employed to investigate glacier thickness changes. The WKM region consists of 537 glaciers (>0.02 km(2)) with a total area of 3137 km(2) in 2013. Out of these, 16 groups of glaciers covering an area about 1234 km(2) (2013) showed varying surface elevation trends ranging from -0.4 +/- 020 m/a to 0.7 +/- 24 m/a over 2003-2008, except the serious thinning trend (-1.15 +/- 0.41 m/a) detected at a surging glacier. The surging glacier (the Zhongfeng glacier) is characterized by drastic elevation variations (up to -80 m) and contrasting trends over the accumulation areas due to cavein and rapid transfer of ice to the downstream. The heterogeneous glacier behavior in the WKM region was not only exemplified in the varying mass balances of individual glaciers but also the spatial variability of elevation trends over different glacier parts (accumulation\ ablation areas). Analysis of the heterogeneity shows that such glacier dynamics were probably associated with local glacier parameters including altitude, aspect, glacier hypsometry and ice flow. The mechanisms for the mass gain and glacier surging in the WKM region require further studies with more observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of CryoSat-2/SIRAL altimetty for river level monitoring is investigated by using river levels retrieved from Ganges and Brahmaputra. A key concern for the CryoSat-2 orbit has been its long repeat period of 369 days, which is usually undesirable for river and lake monitoring. However, the results from the method developed in this study involving virtual stations show that the CryoSat-2 data can indeed be used for such monitoring by utilizing the high spatial coverage and the sub-cycle period of 30 days. The results show that it is possible to capture the peak flow occurring during late summer due to monsoonal precipitation and the melting of snow in the Himalayas. The evaluation of ClyoSat-2 river levels is performed by comparing with Envisat data in terms of annual signals and amplitudes. The obtained annual amplitudes agree well with the Envisat data, although CryoSat-2 exhibit larger differences. For five virtual stations in the Brahmaputra River, the mean difference between the obtained amplitudes is similar to 10 cm, whereas the mean phase difference is less than 2.7 days. A virtual station in the Ganges River shows a phase difference of around 5 days and a difference in amplitude of 2 cm. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Variability in spectral reflectance due to spatial and temporal gradients in vegetation phenology presents issues for accurate vegetation classification. Phenological variability through space and over time can result in misclassification when spectra from non-representative areas or times are used as training data. Vegetation classification at the species level could benefit from introducing phenological information to spectral libraries, but utilization of this information across multiple dates of imagery will require new approaches to building spectral libraries and to classification. This paper explores an automated method for selecting a single multi-temporal spectral library that can be used to classify vegetation species across multiple dates within an image time series. Iterative Endmember Selection (IES) was used to select spectra from Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data acquired on five dates in the same year. IES selected spectra to maximize species classification accuracy (as measured by Kappa) within a multi-temporal spectral library that included spectra from all image dates. The resulting multi-temporal endmember library was applied using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to classify vegetation species and land cover across all five images. Results indicate that multi-temporal, seasonally-mixed spectral libraries achieved similar overall classification accuracy compared to single-date libraries, and in some cases, resulted in improved classification accuracy. Several species had increased Producer's or User's accuracy using a multi-temporal library, while others had reduced accuracy compared to same-date classifications. The image dates of endmembers used to map species in each image were examined to determine if this information could improve our understanding of phenological spectral differences for specific species. Multi-temporal endmember libraries could provide a means for mapping species in data where phenology, climatic variability, or spatial gradients are not known in advance or may not be easily accounted for by endmembers from a single date. New missions, such as the proposed Hysperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission, will provide greatly improved access to multi-temporal spectral datasets and new opportunities for mapping vegetation spectral variability on regional-to-global scales.

AB Freshwater ecosystems underpin global water and food security, yet are some of the most endangered ecosystems in the world because they are particularly vulnerable to land management change and climate variability. The US National Research Council's guidance to NASA regarding missions for the coming decade includes a polar orbiting, global mapping hyperspectral satellite remote sensing mission, the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI), to make quantitative measurements of ecosystem change. Traditionally, freshwater ecosystems have been challenging to measure with satellite remote sensing because they are small and spatially complex, require high fidelity spectroradiometry, and are best described with biophysical variables derived from high spectral resolution data. In this study, we evaluate the contribution of a hyperspectral global mapping satellite mission to measuring freshwater ecosystems. We demonstrate the need for such a mission, and evaluate the suitability and gaps, through an examination of the measurement resolution issues impacting freshwater ecosystem measurements (spatial, temporal, spectral and radiometric). These are exemplified through three case studies that use remote sensing to characterize a component of freshwater ecosystems that drive primary productivity. The high radiometric quality proposed for the HyspIRI mission makes it uniquely well designed for measuring freshwater ecosystems accurately at moderate to high spatial resolutions. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the HyspIRI mission are well suited for the retrieval of multiple biophysical variables, such as phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. The effective temporal resolution is suitable for characterizing growing season wetland phenology in temperate regions, but may not be appropriate for tracking algal bloom dynamics, or ecosystem responses to extreme events in monsoonal regions. Global mapping missions provide the systematic, repeated measurements necessary to measure the drivers of freshwater biodiversity change. Archival global mapping missions with open access and free data policies increase end user uptake globally. Overall, an archival, hyperspectral global mapping mission uniquely meets the measurement requirements of multiple end users for freshwater ecosystem science and management. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB We have developed and validated a robust empirical model for estimating the concentrations of total suspended matter (TSM) in Lake Taihu (China), a large turbid inland water body. This model was generated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua) medium-resolution (250 m) data gathered from 2003 to 2013 and in situ data collected from a number of cruise surveys. A strong significant correlate relationship between the in situ TSM data and the atmospherically corrected MODIS-Aqua remote sensing reflectance at the 645 nm band (R-rs(645)) was found (R-2 = 0.70, p < 0.001, n = 150). From these data, a local TSM model was developed for Lake Taihu. Long-term TSM distribution maps retrieved from the MODIS-Aqua data demonstrated marked temporal and spatial variations. Temporally, significant lower TSM was found in summer and autumn than in winter and spring (p < 0.005, t-test). The significant seasonal variability could be attributed to sediment resuspension due to changes in the wind speed between different seasons. Lake Taihu also experiences large inter-annual variations that are primarily caused by changes in wind force over the region. In particular, the TSM in Lake Taihu from 2006 to 2008 was relatively lower than in other years, which could be explained by the lower mean wind speed during these years compared to the other years. Spatially, the TSM in the Open area, especially in the southern part of this region, was consistently higher than in other sub-regions of Lake Taihu. The coverage of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) generally characterized East Lake Taihu as a region with a relatively lower TSM. Lake topographic conditions, SAV, and runoff discharge jointly contributed to the spatial variations in TSM. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Active and passive microwave satellite remote sensing are enabling sub-daily global observations of surface soil moisture (SM) for hydrological, meteorological and climatological studies. Because the retrieved SM data can be quite noisy, post-retrieval processing such as de-noising can play an important role to aid interpretation of the observed dynamics or enhance their utility for data assimilation. To date, the merits of such techniques have not yet been fully evaluated. Here we consider the applications of Fourier-based de-noising filters of Su et al. (2013a) for improving SM retrieved by AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System) and ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer of MetOp-A) sensors. The filters are calibrated in the frequency domain based on a water-balance model, without the need for ancillary data. The evaluation of the de-noising methods was conducted globally against in situ data distributed via the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) at 277 AMSR-E and 385 ASCAT pixels. Systematic improvements were found for all considered metrics, namely root-mean-square deviation, linear correlation and signal-to-noise ratio, for both SM products, with improvements more striking for AMSR-E. However, the originally proposed implementation of the filters can induce undesirable over-smoothing and distortion of SM timeseries. To overcome this, based on a simple heuristic argument, we propose the use of ancillary precipitation data in the filtering process, although at some expense of overall agreements with the in situ data.

AB This study assesses two remotely sensed soil moisture products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), a sensor onboard the Global Change Observation Mission 1 - Water (GCOM-W1) that was launched in May 2012. The soil moisture products were retrieved by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) algorithm and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) developed by the VU University Amsterdam, in collaboration with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The two products are compared at the global scale. In addition, the products are evaluated against field measurements from 47 stations from the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) network which are located in the United States (36 stations), Australia (7 stations), Europe (2 stations) and Africa (2 stations).
   After examining the retrieval algorithms, it is hypothesized that four factors, namely, physical surface temperatures, surface roughness, vegetation and ground soil wetness conditions, may affect the quality of soil moisture retrievals. From the inter-comparisons at the global scale, the correlations of the two products highlight differences in the representation of the,seasonal cycle of soil moisture, with negative correlations found for several regions. Correlations of the anomaly time series were generally strong (R > 0.6) as a result of soil moisture sensitivity to external meteorological forcing and possibly also random noise in the satellite observations. Due to the inherent differences in spatial coverage and measurement scale of the COSMOS and satellite data, the comparisons in terms of correlation coefficients are the most reliable. It was found that both products show rapid decreases in correlation coefficients under low mean temperature (<290 K), high mean EVI (>0.3) and highly wetted conditions. These findings are further supported by the bias and RMSE estimates which show that JAXA has relatively better performance under dry conditions while the bias and RMSE of LPRM are generally smaller than JAXA, when considered against the four variables. These results provide information on appropriate parameterizations and model selection for the retrieval algorithms and a future research direction to improve the quality by leveraging the strengths of-the JAXA and LPRM algorithms. With these, when a multi-year dataset is available, there will be more confidence in defining the seasonal cycle and the data can be decomposed to identify the anomalies where the bias is not relevant.

AB The use of active fire detections for direct burned area mapping has been limited by the coarse spatial resolution and long revisit cycles of previous sensors. However, the recently developed VIIRS 375 m active fire detection product offers enhanced spatial resolution and temporal revisit cycle, and high sensitivity to small active fires. In this study, we apply that product and assess its performance for direct burned area estimation. Consecutive VIIRS 375 m active fire detections were aggregated to produce the VIIRS 375 m burned area (BA) estimation over ten ecologically diverse study areas. The accuracy of the burned area estimations was assessed by comparison with Landsat-8 supervised burned area classification. The performance of the VIIRS 375 m BA estimates was dependent on the ecosystem characteristics and fire behavior. Higher accuracy was observed in forested areas characterized by large long-duration fires, while grasslands, savannas and agricultural areas showed the highest omission and commission errors. VIIRS 375 m data proved to have higher sensitivity to small fires and higher fire detection rates compared to previous studies, indicating good potential as a complementary dataset for use in routine burned area mapping systems based on cumulative fire count or seeding of spectral signature approaches. Results from the application of VIIRS 375 m fire data to directly monitor the growth of long-lasting wildfires using the 2013 Rim Fire example in California showed high agreement with available fine-resolution airborne data, therefore serving as an alternative source of information for near real-time mapping of fire-affected areas.

AB Spatial and temporal information on plant functional traits are lacking in ecology, which limits our understanding of how plant communities and ecosystems are changing. This problem is acute in remote tropical regions, where information on plant functional traits is difficult to ascertain. We used Carnegie Airborne Observatory visible-to-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectroscopy with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to assess the foliar traits of Amazonian and Andean tropical forest canopies. We calibrated and validated the retrieval of 15 canopy foliar chemicals and leaf mass per area (LMA) across a network of 79 1-hectare field plots using a new VSWIR-LiDAR fusion approach designed to accommodate the enormous scale mismatch between field and remote sensing studies. The results indicate that sparse and highly variable field sampling can be integrated with VSWIR-LiDAR data to yield demonstrably accurate estimates of canopy foliar chemical traits. This new airborne approach addresses the inherent limitations and sampling biases associated with field-based studies of forest functional traits, particularly in structurally and floristically complex tropical canopies.

AB Satellite-based measurements of vegetation canopy structure have been in common use for the last decade but have never been used to estimate canopy's impact on wind sheltering of individual lakes. Wind sheltering is caused by slower winds in the wake of topography and shoreline obstacles (e.g. forest canopy) and influences heat loss and the flux of wind-driven mixing energy into lakes, which control lake temperatures and indirectly structure lake ecosystem processes, including carbon cycling and thermal habitat partitioning. Lakeshore wind sheltering has often been parameterized by lake surface area but such empirical relationships are only based on forested lakeshores and overlook the contributions of local land cover and terrain to wind sheltering. This study is the first to examine the utility of satellite imagery-derived broad-scale estimates of wind sheltering across a diversity of land covers. Using 30 m spatial resolution ASTER GDEM2 elevation data, the mean sheltering height, h(s), being the combination of local topographic rise and canopy height above the lake surface, is calculated within 100 m-wide buffers surrounding 76,000 lakes in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Uncertainty of GDEM2-derived h(s) was compared to SRTM-, high-resolution G-LiHT lidar-, and ICESat-derived estimates of h(s), respective influences of land cover type and buffer width on h(s), are examined; and the effect of including satellite-based h, on the accuracy of a statewide lake hydrodynamic model was discussed. Though GDEM2 h(s), uncertainty was comparable to or better than other satellite-based measures of h(s), its higher spatial resolution and broader spatial coverage allowed more lakes to be included in modeling efforts. GDEM2 was shown to offer superior utility for estimating h(s), compared to other satellite-derived data, but was limited by its consistent underestimation of h(s), inability to detect within-buffer h(s), variability, and differing accuracy across land cover types. Nonetheless, considering a GDEM2 h(s)-derived wind sheltering potential improved the modeled lake temperature root mean square error for non-forested lakes by 0.72 degrees C compared to a commonly used wind sheltering model based on lake area alone. While results from this study show promise, the liinitations of near-global GDEM2 data in timeliness, temporal and spatial resolution, and vertical accuracy were apparent. As hydrodynamic modeling and high-resolution topographic mapping efforts both expand, future remote sensing-derived vegetation structure data must be improved to meet wind sheltering accuracy requirements to expand our understanding of lake processes.

AB The baseline radiometer brightness temperature (Tb) downscaling algorithm for NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, scheduled for launch in January 2015, is tested using an airborne simulation of the SMAP data stream. The algorithm synergistically uses 3 km Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter (sigma) to downscale a 36 km radiometer Tb to 9 km. While the algorithm has already been tested using experimental datasets from field campaigns in the USA, it is imperative that it is tested for a comprehensive range of land surface conditions (i.e. in different hydro-climatic regions) before global application. Consequently, this study evaluates the algorithm using data collected from the Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiments (SMAPEx) in south-eastern Australia, that closely simulate the SMAP data stream for a single SMAP radiometer pixel over a 3-week interval, with repeat coverage every 2-3 days. The results suggest that the average root-mean-square error (RMSE) in downscaled Tb is 3.1 K and 2.6 K for h- and v-polarizations respectively, when downscaled to 9 km resolution. This increases to 8.2 K and 6.6 K when applied at 1 km resolution. Downscaling over the relatively homogeneous grassland areas resulted in 2 K lower RMSE than for the heterogeneous cropping area. Overall, the downscaling error was around 2.4 K when applied at 9 km resolution for five of the nine days, which meets the 2.4 K error target of the SMAP mission. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The systematic error based on median ratio between QAA-derived and measured a(lambda) varied from about 1% to +/- 10% depending on light wavelength and the oceanic region. The QAA typically overestimated b(b)(lambda) from 3% to 14% compared with field measurements. These results were obtained with a correction for Raman-scattering contribution to R-rs and separate parameterization of molecular and particulate backscattering in the R-rs vs. b(b)/a relationship. Without these features the earlier versions of the QAA can overestimate b(b)(lambda) by as much as 35% in clear waters. The use of pure seawater backscattering coefficients accounting for water temperature and salinity improved the accuracy of QAA-derived a(lambda) in Arctic waters. The absorption-partitioning component of the QAA significantly underestimated phytoplankton absorption and overestimated non-phytoplankton absorption in both Arctic and lower-latitude waters.

AB Coastal mangrove ecosystems are under duress worldwide because of urban development, sea-level rise, and climate change, processes that are capable of changing the salinity and nutrient concentration of the water utilized by the mangroves. This study correlates long-term water chemistry in mangrove environments, located in Everglades National Park, with mangrove spectral reflectance measurements made at both the leaf and canopy scales. Spectral reflectance measurements were collected using a handheld spectrometer for leaf-level measurements and Landsat 5TM data for regional coverage. Leaf-level reflectance data were collected from three mangrove species (i.e., red, black and white mangroves) across two regions; a tall mangrove (similar to 18 m) and dwarf mangrove (1-2 m) region. The reflectance data were then used to calculate a wide variety of biophysical reflectance indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI, SAVI) to determine signs of stress. Discrete, quarterly water samples from the surface water, groundwater, and pore water (20 and 85 cm depths) and daily autonomous surface water samples were collected at each site and analyzed for major anions (Cl- and SO42-), cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). Mangrove sites that exhibited the highest salinity and ionic concentrations in the surface and subsurface water also had the lowest near-infrared reflectance at both the leaf and satellite levels. Seasonal reflectance responses were measured in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths at both the leaf and canopy scales and were strongly correlated with nutrient and ionic concentrations in the surface and subsurface water, even though there was no significant separability between the three mangrove species. Study sites that experienced the greatest variability in surface and subsurface water ionic concentrations also exhibited the greatest fluctuations in NIR spectral reflectance. Landsat 5TM images were able to detect tall and dwarf mangroves by the differences in spectral indices (e.g., NDVI, NDWI, and EVI) because of the variability in the background conditions amongst the environments. In addition, Landsat 5TM images spanning 16 years (1993-2009) were successfully used to estimate the seasonal variability in ionic concentrations in the surface water across the Florida Coastal mangrove ecotone. This study has shown that water chemistry can be estimated indirectly by measuring the change in spectral response at the leaf- or satellite-scale. Furthermore, the results of this research may be extrapolated to similar coastal mangrove systems throughout the Caribbean and world-wide wherever red, black, and white mangroves occur.

AB Remote sensing has proved to be a consistent tool for monitoring water fluxes at regional scales. The triangle method, in particular, estimates the evaporative fraction (EF), defined as the ratio of latent heat flux (LE) to available energy, based on the relationship between satellite observations of land surface temperature and a vegetation index. Among other methodologies, this approach has been commonly used as an approximation to estimate LE, mainly over large semi-arid areas with uniform landscape features. In this study, an interpretation of the triangular space has been applied over a heterogeneous area in central Spain, using Landsat5-TM, Envisat-AATSR/MERIS and MSG-SEVIRI images. Some aspects affecting the model performance such as spatial resolution, terrain conditions, vegetation index applied and method for deriving the triangle edges have been assessed. The derived EF estimations have been validated against ground measurements obtained with scintillometer on a winter crop field during 2010-2011. When working with large spatial windows, removing areas with different topographic characteristics (altitude and slope) improved the performance of the methods. In addition, replacing the typically used NDVI with Leaf Area Index enhances the performance of the triangle method allowing a better characterization of the wet edge. Finally, results showed a relatively good performance for the EF estimates, with an RMSE of 0.11, 0.15 and 0.23 and R-2 of 0.77, 0.41, and 0.24 for Landsat, Envisat and MSG satellites respectively, showing a scale dependency on the accuracy.

AB An extensive set of field measurements have been collected throughout the continental margin of the northeastern U.S. from 2004 to 2011 to develop and validate ocean color satellite algorithms for the retrieval of the absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)) and CDOM spectral slopes for the 275:295 nm and 300:600 nm spectral range (S-275:295 and S-300:600). Remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) measurements computed from in-water radiometry profiles along with a(CDOM)(lambda) data are applied to develop several types of algorithms for the SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua ocean color satellite sensors, which involve least squares linear regression of a(CDOM)(X) with (1)R-rs band ratios, (2) quasi-analytical algorithm-based (QAA-based) products of total absorption coefficients, (3) multiple R-rs bands within a multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis, and (4) diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d). The relative error (mean absolute percent difference; MAPD) for the MLR retrievals of a(CDOM)(275), a(CDOM)(355), a(CDOM)(380), a(CDOM)(412) and a(CDOM)(443) for our study region range from 20.4 to 23.9% for MODIS-Aqua and 27.3-30% for SeaWiFS. Because of the narrower range of CDOM spectral slope values, the MAPD for the MLR S-275:295 and S-300:600 algorithms are much lower ranging from 9.9% and 9.1% for SeaWiFS, respectively, and 8.7% and 9.7% for MODIS, respectively. Multi-year, seasonal and spatial MODIS-Aqua and SeaWiFS distributions of Claw, S-275:295 and S-300:600 processed with these algorithms are consistent with field measurements and the processes that impact CDOM levels along the continental shelf of the northeastern U.S. Several satellite data processing factors correlate with higher uncertainty in satellite retrievals of a(CDOM), S-275:295 and S-300.600 within the coastal ocean, including solar zenith angle, sensor viewing angle, and atmospheric products applied for atmospheric corrections. Algorithms that include ultraviolet R-rs bands provide a better fit to field measurements than algorithms without the ultraviolet R-rs bands. This suggests that satellite sensors with ultraviolet capability could provide better retrievals of CDOM. Because of the strong correlations between CDOM parameters and DOM constituents in the coastal ocean, satellite observations of CDOM parameters can be applied to study the distributions, sources and sinks of DOM, which are relevant for understanding the carbon cycle, modeling the Earth system, and to discern how the Earth is changing.

AB Time-varying crop coefficients (Kc) can be obtained from remotely sensed data and combined with daily potential evapotranspiration estimates for the operational prediction of actual evapotranspiration (ETA). This approach, however, presents relevant limitations when applied in mixed, water stressed ecosystems. The current paper addresses these issues by introducing two innovations. First, fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is derived from NDVI and utilized to split evaporating and transpiring surfaces, whose behavior is simulated under fully watered conditions by the use of generalized Kc. Next, the short term effect of water shortage is taken into account by means of downregulating factors which are based on meteorological observations (potential evapotranspiration and rainfall) and act differently for vegetated and not vegetated surfaces. The new method is tested against latent heat of evaporation (LE) measurements taken by the eddy covariance technique in six sites of Central Italy representative of various forest and herbaceous ecosystems. In this experiment the method is driven by 1-km meteorological data obtained from a pan-European archive and by 250 m MODIS NDVI imagery. Satisfactory accuracies are obtained in all experimental situations, which encourages the application of the method for the operational monitoring of ETA on regional scale. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Understanding species-habitat relationships is critical for wildlife management, providing information on habitat requirements, distribution, and potential land use impacts. In this paper, we examined occurrence and abundance-habitat relationships for moose (Alces alces), a species of economic and ecological importance, across its range in southern and central Ontario. We (1) evaluated and tested competing hypotheses for predicting moose distribution and abundance, and (2) examined the ability of remotely derived environmental indicators to characterize and extrapolate moose habitat throughout the Ontario moose range. To do so, remotely sensed environmental indicators - including vegetation productivity calculated using the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI), land cover, topography, snow cover, and natural and anthropogenic disturbances - were used to estimate moose occurrence and abundance derived from moose aerial survey data. A 2-step Hurdle model was used to accommodate for zero-inflated data, separately modeling moose occurrence and abundance in a common model framework. Our results indicate that remotely sensed indicators are able to estimate moose occurrence with a moderate degree of certainty; however, these environmental indicators did not successfully estimate moose abundance. The approach outlined in this paper provides a useful framework for hypothesis testing of remote sensing environmental drivers at broad scales, as well as for estimating moose occurrence at the regional level.

AB In recognition of the role of mangrove forests as natural barriers and bio-shields in protecting coastal population and property in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster, many Asian countries have launched various projects to restore and conserve mangrove trees. The growth and vitality condition of mangroves may be negatively influenced by various anthropogenic and natural disturbances and stresses, such as cold weather events. This paper represents the first attempt to map the cold damage to mangroves in the tropical zone of Southern China using high resolution multispectral satellite imagery. In this study, the spatial distribution of severity level of cold damage to mangroves imposed by a rare blizzard in Southern China during early 2008 has been mapped and analyzed using IKONOS image. An object-oriented classification applied to the images achieved an overall accuracy of 90.9% for classifying mangroves into three categories: undamaged, damaged, and dead. Of the total 287.30 ha of mapped mangroves, approximately 51.1% were damaged or died due to the cold stress of the blizzard. These results have been verified by more recent WorldView-II images. Furthermore, we explored the associations between the cold damage severity level of mangroves and climate and landscape factors, including elevation, surface slope, aspect, wind direction and velocity, wind shadow effect, and tree height. The surface topographical variables are derived from the ASTER Global DEM. The analysis results suggest that wind direction, terrain topography, and proximity to ocean are important local environmental factors controlling the vulnerability of mangroves to cold damage. Most damaged mangroves were located near the open sea, as a result of a possible edge exposure effect. The damage to the mangroves on the leeward side of a hill was also minimal. Such knowledge of climate and landscape controls can offer insight on how to better restore and protect the mangrove forest in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Upward migration of underground cavities can pose a major hazard for people and infrastructure. Either via sudden collapse sinkholes, or by eroding the support of building foundations, a migrating cavity can cause the collapse of buildings, water defense systems, or transport infrastructure. The main problem for risk assessment is the lack of a priori knowledge on the location of a potentially hazardous cavity. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of satellite radar interferometry to detect a migrating cavity under the city of Heerlen, the Netherlands, leading to foundation instability and the near-collapse of a part of a shopping mall in December 2011. We exploit the data archives of four imaging radar satellites, between 1992 and 2011, to investigate the dynamics of the area and detect shear strain within the structure of the building. Time series analysis shows localized differential vertical deformation rates of similar to 3 mm/yr during 18 years, followed by a dramatic increase of up to similar to 15 mm/yr in the last few years. These results imply that the driving mechanism of the 2011 near-collapse event had a very long lead time and was likely due to a long-lasting gradual process, such as the upward migration of a cavity.

AB Remote sensing of ocean color is a powerful tool for monitoring phytoplankton in the ocean with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Several methods were developed in the past years for detecting phytoplankton functional types from satellite observations. In this paper, we present an automatic classification method based on a neural network clustering algorithm in order to classify the anomalies of water leaving radiance spectra (Ra), introduced in the PHYSAT method by Alvain et al. (2005), and analyze their variability at the global scale. The use of an unsupervised classification aims at improving the characterization of the spectral variability of Ra in terms of shape and amplitude as well as the expansion of its potential use to larger in situ datasets for global phytoplankton remote sensing. The Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM, Kohonen, 1984) aggregates similar spectra into a reduced set of pertinent groups, allowing the characterization of the Ra variability, which is known to be linked with phytoplanlcton community composition (Alvain et al., 2012).
   Based on the same sample of Ra spectra, a comparison between the previous version of PHYSAT (Alvain et al., 2005, 2008) and the new one using SOM shows that it is now possible to take into consideration all the types of spectra. This was not possible with the previous approach, based on thresholds, defined in order to avoid overlaps between the spectral signatures of each phytoplankton group. The SOM-based method is relevant for characterizing a wide variety of Ra spectra through its ability to handle large amounts of data, in addition to its statistical reliability and processing speed compared to the previous PHYSAT. The former approach might have introduced potential biases and thus, its extension to larger databases was very restricted. This is not the case with the new statistical design presented in this work.
   In the second step, some new Ra spectra have been related to phytoplankton groups using collocated field pigment inventories from a large in situ database. Phytoplankton groups were identified based on biomarker pigment ratio thresholds taken from the literature. SOM was then applied to the global daily SeaWiFS (Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor) imagery archive between 1997 and 2010. Global distributions of major phytoplankton groups were analyzed and validated against in situ data. Thanks to its ability to capture a wide range of spectra and to manage a larger in situ pigment dataset, the neural network tool allows to classify a much higher number of pixels (2 times more) than the previous PHYSAT method for the five phytoplankton groups taken into account in this study (Synechococcus-like-cyanobacteria, diatoms, Prochlorococcus, Nanoeucaryotes and Phaeocystis-like). In addition, different Ra spectral signatures have been associated to diatoms. These signatures are located in various environments where the inherent optical properties affecting the Ra spectra are likely to be significantly different Local phenomena such as diatom blooms in the upwelling regions or during climatic events (Le. La Nina) are more clearly visible with the new method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate spatiotemporal snow data are crucial for understanding climate systems and managing water resources in cold regions. This paper describes a snow data assimilation system that employs the ensemble Kalman filter to directly assimilate passive microwave brightness temperature data into a snow process model. In the system, the Common Land Model coupled with a snow grain size growth algorithm was adopted to predict layered snow state variables. The forcing data were derived from the Japan Meteorological Administration-Global Spectral Model (JMA-GSM) operational global data assimilation system. The Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS) was used to convert the snow state variables to brightness temperatures. The snow data assimilation system was one-dimensionally tested at a Siberian cold region reference site of the Coordinated Enhanced Observation Project (CEOP). The validation experiment indicates that the data assimilation system can improve depth estimates during the accumulation period but not the ablation period. The assimilation method proposed herein can be easily applied to an operational weather forecasting system to improve snow depth estimations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated how lidar-derived vegetation indices, disturbance history from Landsat time series (LTS) imagery, plot location accuracy, and plot size influenced accuracy of statistical spatial models (nearest-neighbor imputation maps) of forest vegetation composition and structure. Nearest-neighbor (NN) imputation maps were developed for 539,000 ha in the central Oregon Cascades, USA. Mapped explanatory data included tasseled-cap indices and disturbance history metrics (year, magnitude, and duration of disturbance) from LTS imagery, lidar-derived vegetation metrics, climate, topography, and soil parent material. Vegetation data from USDA Forest Service forest inventory plots was summarized at two plot sizes (plot and subplot) and geographically located with two levels of accuracy (standard and improved). Maps of vegetation composition and structure were developed with the Gradient Nearest Neighbor (GNN) method of NN imputation using different combinations of explanatory variables, plot spatial resolution, and plot positional accuracy. Lidar vegetation indices greatly improved predictions of live tree structure, moderately improved predictions of snag density and down wood volume, but did not consistently improve species predictions. LTS disturbance metrics improved predictions of forest structure, but not to the degree of lidar indices, while also improving predictions of many species. Absence of disturbance attribution (i.e. disturbance type such as fire or timber harvest) in LTS disturbance metrics may have limited our ability to predict forest structure. Absence of corrected lidar intensity values may also have lowered accuracy of snag and species predictions. However, LTS disturbance attribution and lidar corrected intensity values may not be able to overcome fundamental limitations of remote sensing for predicting snags and down wood that are obscured by the forest canopy. Improved GPS plot locations had little influence on map accuracy, and we suggest under what conditions improved GPS plot locations may or may not improve the accuracy of predictive maps that link remote sensing with forest inventory plots. Subplot NN imputation maps had much lower accuracy compared to maps generated using response variables from larger whole plots. No single map had optimal results for every mapped variable, suggesting map users and developers need to prioritize what forest vegetation attributes are most important for any given map application.

AB Using multispectral remote sensing, glacier surfaces can be classified into a range of zones. The properties of these classes are used for a range of glaciological applications including mass balance measurements, glacial hydrology, and melt modelling. However, it is not immediately evident that multispectral data should be optimal for imaging glaciers and ice caps. Thus, this investigation takes an inverse perspective. Taking into account spectral and radiometric properties, in situ spectral reflectance data were used to simulate glacier surface response for a suite of multispectral sensors. Sensor-simulated data were classified and compared. In addition, airborne multispectral imagery was classified for a range of spatial resolutions and intercompared in three different ways. In these analyses, the most important property which determined the suitability of a multispectral imager for glacier surface classification was its radiometric range (i.e. gain settings). Low resolution imagery (250 m pixels) is too coarse to represent the true complexity present on a glacier while medium resolution imagery (60 m, 30 m, or 20 m) accurately represented the results derived from high resolution airborne imagery. Of those studied here, the satellite imagers currently in use that are most suitable for glacier surface classification are Landsat TM/ETM+ and ASTER (each with particular gain settings). Both Sentinel-2 and the OLI on Landsat 8 are also expected to be similarly qualified. Landsat MSS is also found to be radiometrically well-suited for glacier surface classification, but its lower spatial resolution makes it a secondary selection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB A model is proposed to simulate top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations in the visible to near-infrared (NIR) spectral range, over a pseudo-invariant calibration site, the so-called Libya-4 site. The model is based on a fully physical radiative transfer model simulating the coupling between a realistic atmosphere and a spectral surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model parameterised by 4 free parameters. At first, the model is 'calibrated' on 4 years of MERIS observations by inverting the 4 free parameters of the surface BRDF model that provide the best fit to the MERIS observations. The model mimics the MERIS TOA observations with a precision of approximately 1% RMSE outside water vapour and O-2 absorption features. The inverted BRDF model parameters obtained at MERIS spectral bands are then spectrally interpolated and used as input to the radiative transfer model to simulate observations from ATSR-2, AATSR, A-MODIS, MERIS, POLDER-3 and VEGETATION-2 over the 2002 to 2012 period. Depending on the spectral band considered, AATSR radiometry appears 2% to 3% above the model 'calibrated' on MERIS radiometry, A-MODIS is 0% to 3% below, POLDER-3 is 2% to 4% below and VEGETATION-2 about 4% below. ATSR-2 data during the 2002 to early 2003 period are almost 10% below their simulations. Temporal trends between simulations and observations are also measured for all sensors. The smallest linear trends are observed for the MERIS 3rd reprocessing data (below 1%/decade). The temporal trends obtained from all sensors against the coupled surface-atmosphere model are in line with expected residual errors of instrument degradation model used in temporal extrapolation: larger in blue than in the NIR. The combined temporal trends from all sensors tend to demonstrate that the Libia-4 site is radiometrically stable in the visible to the NIR to better than 1%/decade for the 2002-2012 period, thus quantitatively confirming that it is a terrestrial target particularly adequate for the assessment of the temporal stability of Earth Observation sensors.

AB Land surface albedo is considered to be a fundamental quantity for accurate assessment of the surface energy budget. Whereas satellite products usually provide total surface albedo, land surface models often require a separation of snow-free surface albedos of the vegetation canopy and the underlying bare soil. In this paper, visible (0.3-0.7 mu m) and near infrared (0.7-5.0 mu m) vegetation and bare soil albedos are retrieved from a decade of MODIS data at global scale by using a Kalman Filter-based method. The retrieved quantities show good agreement with those derived in previous studies. The main advantage of the proposed method over other approaches is that it provides albedo components efficiently throughout the year, thus allowing the seasonal cycles to be captured. This study also exploits the relationship linking the retrieved bare soil albedo to soil moisture in order to reinforce indirectly the quality of the albedo splitting. The proposed method makes it possible to update the bare soil and vegetation albedo fields in the ECOCLIMAP land cover map, the database of physiographic parameters used by Meteo-France for climate and NWP modelling. The mean relative difference between the new and the old ECOCLIMAP shortwave albedos (0.3-5.0 mu m) is 8.5% at the global scale if only albedos lower than 0.5 are considered, and 41.2% otherwise. This update of the ECOCLIMAP database will have numerous NWP and climate applications for carbon, energy, and water cycle modelling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The albedo of the Greenland ice sheet plays a key role in the energy balance and climate of the arctic. Change in snow albedo values associated with changing climate conditions can be monitored remotely from satellite platforms viewing the entire Greenland ice sheet, yet comparisons to high quality surface measurements are necessary to assess the accuracy of satellite measurements as new snow albedo algorithms are developed with higher spatial and temporal resolution.
   During May, June, and July 2011, we obtained daily measurements of spectral albedo at Summit, Greenland with an Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) spectroradiometer, scanning at 350-2200 nm. We compare our spectral albedo field measurements to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), using both the Version 005 Direct Broadcast daily albedo product and the recently developed Version 006 MCD43A daily albedo product. The spectral field measurements allow calculation of weighted integrals to compare to seven MODIS narrow bandwidths ranging the UV through Infrared, as well as a broadband integration to compare to the MODIS shortwave albedo. We additionally compare our field measurements to albedo measured at the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) station at Summit.
   Using the MODIS Version 005 Direct Broadcast product, high-quality retrievals only, comparison to field measurements results in root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.033 for the MODIS shortwave product, and RMSE for the MODIS narrow bandwidths ranging 0.022-0.077. The new MODIS Version 006 product shows considerable improvement, with shortwave RMSE of 0.026, and narrow bandwidths ranging 0.020-0.048. These error values for the Version 006 albedo product show an improvement in reported error values from previous MODIS field validations in Greenland, which have been limited to broadband data from the Greenland Climate Network Automatic Weather Stations.

AB The built-up area of the village Hilsprich (Lorraine, France) is affected by a subsidence phenomenon localized over a few hundred square metres, causing damage to buildings. In this study, differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) was used to:
   estimate the boundaries of the subsidence in order to optimize ground-based monitoring networks (levelling and geophysical measurements)
   estimate the maximum deformation and highlight the evolution of the phenomenon (previously unknown due to insufficient historical ground-based data).
   The study was based both on L-band ALOS/PALSAR SAR data and C-band Envisat/ASAR data. The interest in PALSAR data lies in its better performance for InSAR with respect to C-band data on the affected non-urban areas (such as fields and farmlands) where, in addition, conventional techniques such as topographical survey information were limited, and had often not been carried out before the first damage was observed. Conventional DInSAR based on PALSAR data processing for the 2008-2010 period identified the boundary of the subsidence area and estimated its maximum magnitude. The PSI technique in the ASAR archive gave information regarding the beginning of the subsidence. The precision of the DInSAR results was consistent with the topographical data (in locations where this information was known) and therefore favours the SAR interferometric techniques in this context. Combined with the knowledge of the regional geological and structural setting, together with results from ground-based electrosounding, the results of the study established a basis for an increased understanding of the subsidence phenomenon, which was revealed to affect an elliptical bowl-shaped area due to salt dissolution.

AB A simple multi-linear regression model was developed for sea surface salinity, and tested against in situ measurements. The algorithm can be applied to in situ measured reflectance data with a root mean square error of 0.833 psu (R-2 = 0.64). The model was recalibrated based on remote sensing reflectance data derived from MERIS and from in situ salinity data, yielding a RMSE in modeled salinity (relative to in situ data) of 1.311 psu. This recalibrated model can be applied to MODIS data following a linear correction. The spatio-temporal changes in sea surface salinity and in the influence of freshwater flow were analyzed using MERIS, MODIS and river discharge data. Sea surface salinity in Laizhou Bay, Bohai Bay and Liaodong Bay was fresher than that in Qinhuangdao, the central Bohai Sea and Bohai Strait. During 2004-2009, the temporal trends in sea surface salinity varied between sites. Salinity in most parts of the Bohai Sea was increasing. The Yellow River discharge was found to have the greatest influence on sea surface salinity near the river estuary, whereas it had only a weak impact on the salinity far from river mouth. More independent datasets are needed to improve the model and to gain a better understanding of processes controlling changes in sea surface salinity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The residuals that are generated at the coarse resolution are modelled using an Artificial Neural Network model (ANN), and the resulting residuals are added to the disaggregated LST at a fine resolution. The ANN model was built using the NDVI from the neighbourhood pixels. The hypothesis is that the LST of a pixel will not only be affected by the vegetation within the pixel but also by the vegetation of surrounding pixels. The performance of this hybrid model NL-DisTrad (Hot edge model + ANN model) is assessed by comparing the results to the existing disaggregation method, TsHARP, and the observed Landsat LST. The NL-DisTrad disaggregation results were comparable to the observed Landsat I.ST even for pixels with non-uniform vegetation. The statistical analysis indicated that the proposed model disaggregates the LST better than TsHARP, based on, the high Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE > 0.80) and low root mean square error value (RMSE < 0.96 K). Furthermore, using SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land), it was found that the estimates of daily evapotranspiration (ET) from the LST that were disaggregated using NL-DisTrad were comparable to the ET estimates from the observed Landsat LST data. As the disaggregation method NL-DisTrad only needs the LST-NDVI relationship at the coarse resolution, the model could be used to disaggregate the coarse resolution MODIS temperature data to the fine resolution of satellites such as IRS-P6 or SPOT-5 that do not carry any thermal sensors.

AB Agriculture is the basis of the Ethiopian economy, accounting for the majority of its employment and export earnings. Land degradation is, however, widespread and improved targeting of land management interventions is needed, taking into account the variability of soil properties that affect agricultural productivity and land degradation risk across landscapes. In the current study we demonstrate the utility of Landsat ETM + imagery for landscape-level assessments of land degradation risk and soil condition through a combination of systematic field methodologies, infrared (IR) spectroscopy and ensemble modeling techniques. The approaches presented allow for the development of maps at spatial scales that are appropriate for making spatially explicit management recommendations. Field data and soil samples collected from 38 sites, each 100 km(2), were used to develop predictive models that were applied as part of a case study to an independent dataset from four sites in Ethiopia. The predictions based on Landsat reflectance were robust, with R-squared values of 0.86 for pH and 0.79 for soil organic carbon (SOC), and were used to create predicted surfaces (maps) for these soil properties. Further, models were developed for the mapping of the occurrence of soil erosion and root depth restrictions within 50 cm of the soil surface (RDR50), with an accuracy of about 80% for both variables. The maps generated from these models were used to assess the spatial distribution of soil pH and SOC, which are important indicators of soil condition, and land degradation risk factors in order to target relevant management options.

AB In the Arctic, earlier snowmelt and longer growing seasons due to warming have been hypothesized to increase vegetation productivity. Using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from both field and satellite measurements as an indicator of vegetation phenology and productivity, we monitored spatial and temporal patterns of vegetation growth for a coastal wet sedge tundra site near Barrow, Alaska over three growing seasons (2000-2002). Contrary to expectation, earlier snowmelt did not lead to increased productivity. Instead, productivity was associated primarily with precipitation and soil moisture, and secondarily with growing degree days, which, during this period, led to reduced growth in years with earlier snowmelt. Additional moisture effects on productivity and species distribution, operating over a longer time scale, were evident in spatial NDVI patterns associated with microtopography. Lower, wetter regions dominated by graminoids were more productive than higher, drier locations having a higher percentage of lichens and mosses, despite the earlier snowmelt at the more elevated sites. These results call into question the oft-stated hypothesis that earlier arctic growing seasons will lead to greater vegetation productivity. Rather, they agree with an emerging body of evidence from recent field studies indicating that early-season, local environmental conditions, notably moisture and temperature, are primary factors determining arctic vegetation productivity. For this coastal arctic site, early growing season conditions are strongly influenced by microtopography, hydrology, and regional sea ice dynamics, and may not be easily predicted from snowmelt date or seasonal average air temperatures alone. Our comparison of field to satellite NDVI also highlights the value of in-situ monitoring of actual vegetation responses using field optical sampling to obtain detailed information on surface conditions not possible from satellite observations alone.

AB Widespread tree mortality events have recently been observed in several biomes. To effectively quantify the severity and extent of these events, tools that allow for rapid assessment at the landscape scale are required. Past studies using high spatial resolution satellite imagery have primarily focused on detecting green, red, and gray tree canopies during and shortly after tree damage or mortality has occurred. However, detecting trees in various stages of death is not always possible due to limited availability of archived satellite imagery. Here we assess the capability of high spatial resolution satellite imagery for tree mortality detection in a southwestern U.S. mixed species woodland using archived satellite images acquired prior to mortality and well after dead trees had dropped their leaves. We developed a multistep classification approach that uses: supervised masking of non-tree image elements: bi-temporal ( pre- and post-mortality) differencing of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and red:green ratio (RGI): and unsupervised multivariate clustering of pixels into live and dead tree classes using a Gaussian mixture model. Classification accuracies were improved in a final step by tuning the rules of pixel classification using the posterior probabilities of class membership obtained from the Gaussian mixture model. Classifications were produced for two images acquired post-mortality with overall accuracies of 97.9% and 98.5%, respectively. Classified images were combined with land cover data to characterize the spatiotemporal characteristics of tree mortality across areas with differences in tree species composition. We found that 38% of tree crown area was lost during the drought period between 2002 and 2006. The majority of tree mortality during this period was concentrated in pinon-juniper (Pinus edulis-Juniperus monosperma) woodlands. An additional 20% of the tree canopy died or was removed between 2006 and 2011, primarily in areas experiencing wildfire and management activity. -Our results demonstrate that unsupervised clustering of bi-temporal NDVI and RGI differences can be used to detect tree mortality resulting from numerous causes and in several forest cover types.

AB Remotely sensed data is the main source of vegetation leaf area index (LAI) information on the regional to global scale. Many validation results have revealed that the accuracy of the retrieved LAI is often affected by the cloud cover of imagery, instrument problems, and inversion algorithms. Ground meteorological station data, characterized by relatively high accuracy and time continuity compared with remote sensing data, can provide complementary information to remote sensing observations. In this paper, we combine the potential advantages of both types of data in order to improve LAI retrievals in the Heihe River Basin, an arid and semi-arid area in northwest China where Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI values are significantly underestimated. A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is used to integrate these two data types for time series LAI estimation. Results show that the square of correlation coefficient between LAI values estimated by our DBN method (referred to as DBN LAI) and field measured LAI values is 0.76, with a root mean square error of 0.78. The DBN LAI are closer to field measurements than the MODIS LAI standard product values. Moreover, by introducing ground meteorological station data using a dynamic process model, DBN LAI show better temporal consistency than the MODIS LAI. It is concluded that the quality of LAI retrievals can be improved by combining remote sensing data and ground meteorological station data using a filtering inference algorithm in a DBN framework. More importantly, the study provides a basis and method for utilizing ground meteorological station network data to estimate land surface parameters on a regional scale. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB A novel algorithm is presented for detecting trophic status (chlorophyll-a), cyanobacterial blooms, surface scum and floating vegetation in coastal and inland waters using top-of-atmosphere data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The maximum peak-height algorithm (MPH) uses a baseline subtraction procedure to calculate the height of the dominant peak across the red and near-infrared MERIS bands between 664 and 885 nm caused by sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SICF) and particulate backscatter. Atmospheric correction of the MERIS TOA reflectance data for gaseous absorption and Rayleigh scattering proved adequate given the spectral proximity of the relevant bands and the sufficiently large differential spectral signal. This avoided the need to correct for atmospheric aerosols, a procedure which is typically prone to large errors in turbid and high-biomass waters. A combination of switching algorithms for estimating chl-a were derived from coincident in situ chl-a and MERIS bottom-of-Rayleigh reflectance measurements. These algorithms are designed to cover a wide trophic range, from oligotrophic/mesotrophic waters (chl-a<20 mg m(-3)), to eutrophic/hypertrophic waters (chl-a>20 mg m(-3)) and surface scums or dry floating algae or vegetation. Cyanobacteria-dominant waters were differentiated from those dominated by eukaryote algal species (dinoflagellates/diatoms) on the basis of the magnitude of the MPH variable. This is supported by evidence that vacuolate cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) possess enhanced chl-a specific backscatter which is an important bio-optical distinguishing feature. This enables these phytoplankton groups to be distinguished from space. An algorithm derived from cyanobacteria-dominant waters had a r(2) value of 0.58 for chl-a between 33 and 362 mg m(-3) and an error of 33.7% (N=17). The operational algorithm for eukaryote-dominant algal assemblages gave a coefficient of determination of 0.71 and a mean absolute percentage error of 60% for chl-a in the range 0.5-350 mg m(-3) (N=48). A flag based on cyanobacteria-specific spectral pigmentation and fluorescence features was used to identify cyanobacterial-dominance in eutrophic waters. Global applications demonstrate how the MPH algorithm can offer rapid and effective assessment of trophic status, cyanobacterial-dominance, surface scums and floating vegetation in inland and coastal waters.

AB Land cover plays a key role in global to regional monitoring and modeling because it affects and is being affected by climate change and thus became one of the essential variables for climate change studies. National and international organizations require timely and accurate land cover information for reporting and management actions. The North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS) is an international cooperation of organizations and entities of Canada. the United States, and Mexico to map land cover change of North America's changing environment. This paper presents the methodology to derive the land cover map of Mexico for the year 2005 which was integrated in the NALCMS continental map. Based on a time series of 250 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD'S) data and an extensive sample data base the complexity of the Mexican landscape required a specific approach to reflect land cover heterogeneity. To estimate the proportion of each land cover class for every pixel several decision tree classifications were combined to obtain class membership maps which were finally converted to a discrete map accompanied by a confidence estimate. The map yielded an overall accuracy of 82.5% (Kappa of 0.79) for pixels with at least 50% map confidence (71.3% of the data). An additional assessment with 780 randomly stratified samples and primary and alternative calls in the reference data to account for ambiguity indicated 83.4% overall accuracy (Kappa of 0.80). A high agreement of 83.6% for all pixels and 92.6% for pixels with a map confidence of more than 50% was found for the comparison between the land cover maps of 2005 and 2006. Further wall-to-wall comparisons to related land cover maps resulted in 56.6% agreement with the MODIS land cover product and a congruence of 49.5 with Globcover. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

TI Detecting post-fire salvage logging from Landsat change maps and

AB In Canadian boreal forests, wildfire is the predominant agent of natural disturbance often with millions of hectares burning annually. In addition to fire, nearly one quarter of Canada's boreal forest is also managed for industrial wood production. Post-fire logging (or salvage harvesting) is increasingly used to minimize economic losses from fire, notwithstanding that the ecological impacts of successive disturbance events remain poorly understood. Improved monitoring and management of post-fire environments will require new information regarding the location and timing of past operations. In this paper we present and evaluate a data integration approach for detecting spatial and temporal trends in post-fire logging. Here we utilize a series of maps relating timing and extent of burned area (from the Canadian Large Fire Database) and year of harvest (from Landsat change detection) to identify occurrences of post-fire logging between 1987 and 2008 for a portion of boreal forest located in central Saskatchewan, Canada. Using a design-based, stratified random sampling framework we found that 68% (95% confidence interval (CI) [53 to 84%]) of the detected post-fire logging was correctly classified, such that both fire and clearcutting disturbances were positively verified by the reference data. The majority of map error resulted from spectral confusion between harvested areas and rock outcroppings exposed by fire and from mislabeling harvested unburned islands as post-fire logging. To add further confidence to our classification accuracy, we also found that mapped post-fire logging displayed similar temporal trends over a ten year period as salvage volume reported for a forest management area partially contained within the study area. Based upon the significant relationship between these estimates (r = 0.97, p<0.001) and the good degree of observed map accuracy, we believe that the presented approach offers a viable and flexible option for characterizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of post-fire logging in boreal forests. Maps which reliably identify areas of post-fire logging stand to improve our capacity to manage and model the ecological impacts associated with multiple disturbance events.

AB Surface albedo is a key parameter in the Earth's energy balance since it affects the amount of solar radiation directly absorbed at the planet surface. Its variability in time and space can be globally retrieved through the use of remote sensing products. To evaluate and improve the quality of satellite retrievals, careful intercomparisons with in situ measurements of surface albedo are crucial. For this purpose we compared MODIS albedo retrievals with surface measurements taken at 53 FLUXNET sites that met strict conditions of land cover homogeneity. A good agreement between mean yearly values of satellite retrievals and in situ measurements was found (r(2) = 0.82). The mismatch is correlated with the spatial heterogeneity of surface albedo, stressing the relevance of land cover homogeneity when comparing point to pixel data. When the seasonal patterns of MODIS albedo are considered for different plant functional types, the match,. with surface observations is extremely good at all forest sites. On the contrary, satellite retrievals at non-forested sites (grasslands, savannas, croplands) underestimate in situ measurements across the seasonal cycle. The mismatch observed at grassland and cropland sites is likely due to the extreme fragmentation of these landscapes, as confirmed by geostatistical attributes derived from high resolution scenes.

AB An accurate and synoptic quantification of gross primary production (GPP) in crops is essential for studies of carbon budgets at regional and global scales. In this study, we tested a model, relating crop GPP to a product of total canopy chlorophyll (Chl) content and potential incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR(potential)). The approach is based on remotely sensed data; specifically, vegetation indices (VI) that are proxies for total Chl content and PAR(potential), which is incident PAR under a condition of minimal atmospheric aerosol loading. Using VI retrieved from surface reflectance Landsat data, we found that the model is capable of accurately estimating GPP in maize, with coefficient of variation (CV) below 23%, and in soybean with CV below 30%. The algorithms established and calibrated over three Mead, Nebraska AmeriFlux sites were able to estimate maize and soybean GPP at tower flux sites in Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois with acceptable accuracy.

AB A Random Forest (RF) classifier was applied to spectral as well as mono- and multi-seasonal textural features extracted from Landsat TM imagery to increase the accuracy of land cover classification over a complex Mediterranean landscape, with a large number of land cover categories and low inter-class separability. Five different types of geostatistical textural measure for three different window sizes and three different lags were applied creating a total of 972 potential input variables. Madograms, rodograms and direct variograms for the univariate case and cross- and pseudo-cross variograms for the multivariate case, together with multi-seasonal spectral information, were used in a RF classifier to map the land cover types. The pseudo-cross and cross variograms were used specifically to incorporate important seasonal/temporal information. Incorporating multi-scale textural features into the RF models led to an increase in the overall index of 10.71% and, for the most accurate classification, the increase was up to 30% in some classes. The differences in the kappa coefficient for the textural classification models were evaluated statistically using a pairwise Z-test, revealing a significant increase in per-class classification accuracy compared to GLCM-based texture measures. The pseudo-cross variogram between the visible and near-infrared bands was the most important textural features for general classification, and the multi-seasonal pseudo-cross variogram had an outstanding importance for agricultural classes. Overall, the RF classifier applied to a reduced subset of input variables composed of the most informative textural features led to the highest accuracy. Highly reliable classification results were obtained when the 16 most important textural features calculated at single scales (window sizes) were selected and used in the classification. The proposed methodology significantly increased the classification accuracy achieved with a spectral maximum likelihood classifier (ML). The kappa values for the textural RF and ML classifications were equal to 0.92 and 0.83, respectively. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ice surface temperature (IST) imagery from the thermal infrared bands of the satellite-borne Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) has been used to analyze the activity of the Terra Nova Bay polynya from 2005 to 2010. In clear sky conditions, the shape of the open water area of the polynya (i.e. the portion of the ocean free of sea-ice) is revealed by the skin sea-ice temperatures close to the water freezing point provided by the MODIS-derived IST product. The swaths of the MODIS sensors onboard Terra and Aqua satellites over the Terra Nova Bay consist of about 5500 scenes per year, useful to estimate the cloud cover too. The open water area was extracted from clear sky scenes and from scenes affected by fog but providing continuity of the shape of the polynya. Using about 40% of the available swaths, the polynya was detected for more than 80% of the sea-ice period with a revisit time below 24 h and for more than 50% with a revisit time below 3 h. The open water area was extracted using thresholds of IST based on the IST values detected within the open water area and within the band of sea-ice surrounding the polynya, obtained scene by scene. An ice free area larger than 100 km(2) was observed near the Nansen Ice Shelf for more than 70% of time (larger than 500 km2 for 50% of time). The mean annual open water area, around 900 km(2), was close to the lower limit of the reported range except during 2006, around 600 km(2), due to the limited activity in the second half of the cold season. The largest extents, between 6000 and 8500 km(2), occurred in different periods of the Antarctic winter and exceeded maxima estimated in previous studies by thermal infrared data. Polynya openings developed from a few hours to several days, in the latter case sustained by subsequent katabatic events visible in the IST sequence. Peaks of growing rate above 300 km(2)/h were observed during intense katabatic events with gusts of 50 m/s. The fluctuations of the open water area resulted well correlated with wind records available from local Automatic Weather Stations within the main katabatic routes, and followed katabatic events at intervals between 0 and 6 h. The analysis of the IST data set derived from the thermal infrared bands of MODIS provides new polynya observations of high horizontal resolution (1 km) and frequent revisit time during the winter season, complementing previously available observations with passive microwave imagery.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the most important biophysical parameters for modeling ecosystem processes such as carbon and water fluxes. Remote sensing provides the only feasible option for mapping LAI continuously over landscapes, but existing methodologies have significant limitations. There is a tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolutions inherent in remotely sensed images, i.e. high spatial resolution images may only be collected infrequently, whereas imagery with fine temporal resolution has necessarily coarser spatial resolution. LAI products created using a single sensor inherit the spatial and temporal characteristics of that sensor. Moreover, the majority of developed algorithms in the literature use spectral information alone, which suffers from the serious limitation of signal saturation at moderately high LAI. We developed a novel approach for mapping effective LAI (L-e) using spectral information from Landsat, spatial information from IKONOS, and temporal information from MODIS, which overcomes these limitations. The approach is based on an empirical model developed between L-e measured on the ground and spectral and spatial information from remotely sensed images to map annual maximum and minimum L-e. A phenological model was fit to a time series of MODIS vegetation indices which was used to model the trajectory between annual minimum and maximum L-e. This approach was able to generate maps of L-e at Landsat spatial resolution with daily temporal resolution. We tested the approach in the North Carolina Piedmont and generated daily maps of L-e for a 100 km(2) area. Modeled L-e compared well with time series of LAI estimates from two AmeriFlux sites within the study area. A comparison of the MODIS LAI product with spatially averaged L-e estimates from our model showed general agreement in forested areas, but large differences in developed areas. This model takes advantage of multidimensional information available from multiple remote sensors and offers significant improvements for mapping leaf area index, particularly for forested areas where spectral indices tend to saturate.

AB ESA's upcoming satellites Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-3 (53) aim to ensure continuity for Landsat 5/7, SPOTS, SPOT-Vegetation and Envisat MERIS observations by providing superspectral images of high spatial and temporal resolution. S2 and S3 will deliver near real-time operational products with a high accuracy for land monitoring. This unprecedented data availability leads to an urgent need for developing robust and accurate retrieval methods. Machine learning regression algorithms may be powerful candidates for the estimation of biophysical parameters from satellite reflectance measurements because of their ability to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting.
   By using data from the ESA-led field campaign SPARC (Barrax, Spain) we have compared the utility of four state-of-the-art machine learning regression algorithms and four different S2 and S3 band settings to assess three important biophysical parameters: leaf chlorophyll content (Chl), leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The tested Sentinel configurations were: S2-10 m (4 bands), S2-20 m (8 bands), 52-60 m (10 bands) and S3-300 m (19 bands), and the tested methods were: neural networks (NN), support vector regression (SVR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), and Gaussian processes regression (GPR).
   GPR outperformed the other retrieval methods for the majority of tested configurations and was the only method that reached the 10% precision required by end users in the estimation of Chl. Also, although validated with an RMSE accuracy around 20%, GPR yielded optimal LAI and FVC estimates at highest S2 spatial resolution of 10 m with only four bands. In addition to high accuracy values, GPR also provided confidence intervals of the estimates and insight in relevant bands, which are key advantages over the other methods. Given all this, GPR proved to be a fast and accurate nonlinear retrieval algorithm that can be potentially implemented for operational monitoring applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB The relation between physical and biological processes affecting the Mediterranean Sea surface layer was investigated through univariate Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) decompositions of remotely sensed chlorophyll-a (CHL), sea surface temperature (SST) and Mediterranean Absolute Dynamic Topography (MADT) weekly time series (1998-2006). As part of the analysis, the Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) technique was successfully applied to CHL images. Results from the single EOFs, along with a cross-correlation analysis, identified physical-biological interactions at both short (weeks to months) and long (years) temporal scales, and from meso- to basin-scales. Phytoplankton biomass abundance and the sea surface thermal stratification show a strong inverse relationship at seasonal and sub-basin scales. At a regional scale, the spring bloom space-time variability is related to the intensity and spatial extent of the deep water formation process and especially to its pre-conditioning phase. At interannual and sub-basin scales, a gradual decline of the phytoplankton biomass in the whole central Mediterranean occurs with a delay of one year relative to the decrease of the cyclonic circulation in the eastern basin, and the northward displacement of the Algerian current. Regionally, the phytoplankton biomass and the surface heat content anomalies associated with extreme atmospheric anomalies (such as the cold 1998-1999 winter and the summer 2003 heat wave) show a significant correlation with a similar to 5-month time lag.

AB Multiple plant stresses can affect the health, esthetic condition, and timber harvest value of conifer forests. To monitor spatial and temporal dynamic forest stress conditions, timely, accurate, and cost-effective information is needed that could be provided by remote sensing. Recently, satellite imagery has become available via the RapidEye satellite constellation to provide spectral information in five broad bands, including the red-edge region (690-730 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum. We tested the hypothesis that broadband, red-edge satellite information improves early detection of stress (as manifest by shifts in foliar chlorophyll a + b) in a woodland ecosystem relative to other more commonly utilized band combinations of red, green, blue, and near infrared band reflectance spectra. We analyzed a temporally dense time series of 22 RapidEye scenes of a pinon-juniper woodland in central New Mexico acquired before and after stress was induced by girdling. We found that the Normalized Difference Red-Edge index (NDRE) allowed stress to be detected 13 days after girdling between and 16 days earlier than broadband spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Green NDVI traditionally used for satellite based forest health monitoring. We conclude that red-edge information has the potential to considerably improve forest stress monitoring from satellites and warrants further investigation in other forested ecosystems.

AB Red band bidirectional reflectance factor data from the NASA MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) acquired over the southwestern United States were interpreted through a simple geometric-optical (GO) canopy reflectance model to provide maps of fractional crown cover (dimensionless), mean canopy height (m), and aboveground woody biomass (Mg ha(-1)) on a 250 m grid. Model adjustment was performed after dynamic injection of a background contribution predicted via the kernel weights of a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model. Accuracy was assessed with respect to similar maps obtained with data from the NASA Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and to contemporaneous US Forest Service (USFS) maps based partly on Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. MODIS and MISR retrievals of forest fractional cover and mean height both showed compatibility with the USFS maps, with MODIS mean absolute errors (MAE) of 0.09 and 8.4 m respectively, compared with MISR MAE of 0.10 and 2.2 m, respectively. The respective MAE for aboveground woody biomass was similar to 10 Mg ha(-1), the same as that from MISR, although the MODIS retrievals showed a much weaker correlation, noting that these statistics do not represent evaluation with respect to ground survey data. Good height retrieval accuracies with respect to averages from high resolution discrete return lidar data and matches between mean crown aspect ratio and mean crown radius maps and known vegetation type distributions both support the contention that the GO model results are not spurious when adjusted against MISR bidirectional reflectance factor data. These results highlight an alternative to empirical methods for the exploitation of moderate resolution remote sensing data in the mapping of woody plant canopies and assessment of woody biomass loss and recovery from disturbance in the southwestern United States and in parts of the world where similar environmental conditions prevail.

AB The use of lidar and radar instruments to measure forest structure attributes such as height and biomass at global scales is being considered for a future Earth Observation satellite mission, DESDynI (Deformation, Ecosystem Structure, and Dynamics of Ice). Large footprint lidar makes a direct measurement of the heights of scatterers in the illuminated footprint and can yield accurate information about the vertical profile of the canopy within lidar footprint samples. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is known to sense the canopy volume, especially at longer wavelengths and provides image data. Methods for biomass mapping by a combination of lidar sampling and radar mapping need to be developed.
   In this study, several issues in this respect were investigated using aircraft borne lidar and SAR data in Howland, Maine, USA. The stepwise regression selected the height indices rh50 and rh75 of the Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data for predicting field measured biomass with a R-2 of 0.71 and RMSE of 3133 Mg/ha. The above-ground biomass map generated from this regression model was considered to represent the true biomass of the area and was used as a reference map since no better biomass map exists for the area. Random samples were taken from the biomass map and the correlation between the sampled biomass and co-located SAR signature was studied. The best models were used to extend the biomass from lidar samples into all forested areas in the study area, which mimics a procedure that could be used for the future DESDYnI mission. It was found that depending on the data types used (quad-pol or dual-pol) the SAR data can predict the lidar biomass samples with R-2 of 0.63-0.71. RMSE of 32.0-28.2 Mg/ha up to biomass levels of 200-250 Mg/ha. The mean biomass of the study area calculated from the biomass maps generated by lidar-SAR synergy was within 10% of the reference biomass map derived from LVIS data. The results from this study are preliminary, but do show the potential of the combined use of lidar samples and radar imagery for forest biomass mapping. Various issues regarding lidar/radar data synergies for biomass mapping are discussed in the paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Directional microwave scattering, as investigated in this study, is characterized by a strong and narrow scattering pattern that varies strongly for only minor aspect angle changes. As was noted already in the past directional scattering is relevant for applications and cannot just be ignored. The overall objective of our work was to better understand directional scattering. Suited space- and airborne SAR data over several agricultural sites together with related in-situ information were collected for this purpose. Directional scattering was identified by comparison of backscattering acquired with only slightly different aspect angles as available from ERS-ENVISAT pairs with significantly different Doppler Centroids or by comparing azimuth spectrum sub-bands with slightly different Doppler Centroid. Major progress achieved in this work includes the much improved experimental evidence available and significant improvements in the understanding of the scatter phenomenon through the developed scatter model. Good progress was also made in the detection of directional scattering. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The retrieval of indicators of vegetation stress from remote sensing imagery is an important issue for the accurate assessment of forest decline. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has been demonstrated as a physiological index sensitive to the epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and to photosynthetic efficiency, serving as a proxy for short-term changes in photosynthetic activity, stress condition, and pigment absorption, but highly affected by illumination conditions, viewing geometry and canopy structure. In this study, a diurnal airborne campaign was conducted over Pinus sylvestris and Pinus nigra forest areas with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) to evaluate the effects of canopy structure on PRI when used as an indicator of stress in a conifer forest. The AHS airborne sensor was flown at two times (8:00 GMT and 12:00 GMT) over forest areas under varying field-measured stress levels, acquiring 2 m spatial resolution imagery in 80 spectral bands in the 0.43-12.5 mu m spectral range. Five formulations of PRI (based on R-531 as a xanthophyll-sensitive spectral band) were calculated using different reference wavelengths, such as PRI570 (reference band R-REF = R-570), and the PRI modifications PRIm1 (R-REF = R-512). PRIm2 (R-REF = R-600), PRIm3 (R-REF = R-670). and PRIm4 (R-REF = R-570, R-670), along with other structural indices such as NDVI, SR, OSAVI, MSAVI and MTVI2. In addition, thermal bands were used for the retrieval of the land surface temperature. A radiative transfer modeling method was conducted using the LIBERTY and INFORM models to assess the structural effects on the PRI formulations proposed, studying the sensitivity of PRIm indices to detect stress levels while minimizing the effects caused by the conifer architecture. The PRI indices were related to stomatal conductance, xanthophyll epoxidation state (EPS) and crown temperature. The modeling analysis showed that the coefficient of variation (CV) for PRI was 50%. whereas the CV for PRIm1 (band R512 as a reference) was only 20%. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated that PRIm1 (R-REF = R-512) was less sensitive than PRI (R-REF = R-570) to changes in Leaf Area Index (LAI) and tree densities. PRI512 was demonstrated to be sensitive to EPS at both leaf (r(2) = 0.59) and canopy level (r(2) = 0.40), yielding superior performance than PRI570 (r(2) = 0.21) at the canopy level. In addition, PRI512 was significantly related to water stress indicators such as stomatal conductance (Gs; r(2) = 0.45) and water potential (Psi; r(2) = 0.48), yielding better results than PRI570 (Gs, r(2) = 0.21; Psi, r(2) = 0.21) due to the structural effects found on the PRI570 index at the canopy level.

AB Discrete changes in forest abundance, distribution, and productivity are readily detectable using a number of remotely sensed data sources; however, continuous changes such as growth and succession processes are more difficult to monitor. In this research we explore the potential of spectral trajectories generated from a 35-year (1973-2008) time-series of Landsat imagery to characterize change processes in a dynamic forest environment in northwestern Alberta, Canada. We propose a method of hierarchical spatio-temporal segmentation that enables the characterization of change processes that are spatially diffuse and temporally imprecise. Calibrated imagery from Landsat sensors are radiometrically normalized and two metrics derived from the Tasseled Cap Transformation components, greenness and brightness, are used to generate the Tasseled Cap Angle (TCA). The TCA is a measure of the proportion of vegetation to non-vegetation (the occupation state), and its derivative, the Process Indicator (PI), is a measure of change in this proportion through time. These indices condense information from the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, and facilitate lengthy time series analysis of forest landscape change using data from all Landsat sensors.
   A combination of the original TCA and its derivative sequence are input to a three level hierarchical segmentation process with the highest and lowest levels defining homogeneous objects at the initial and final date, and the intermediate level identifying trajectories with similar change processes. The development through time of the TCA and PI are described, and the spatial and temporal associations of processes are statistically assessed using the Moran's Index.
   A full range of change types were identified on the landscape, from stand replacing disturbances to more subtle growth and succession processes. Results indicate that the study area is in a constant state of change, and maintains a high average proportion of vegetation to non-vegetation. The amount of total landscape modified per decade increased from 18% and 14% in the 1970s and 1980s respectively, to more than 30% and 33% in the 1990s and 2000s. On average, the proportion of vegetation to non-vegetation was increasing prior to 1981, decreasing between 1981 and 1997, and increasing post-1997. There was a high degree of spatial autocorrelation amongst change processes, with a maximum Moran's 1 of 0.79 in 1973; landscape change became more spatially disperse and widespread after 1981. Temporal correlation of change processes was observed locally, with the period 1990-1995 having the most persistent change. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation phenology characterizes seasonal life-cycle events that influence the carbon cycle and land-atmosphere water and energy exchange. We analyzed global phenology cycles over a six year record (2003-2008) using satellite passive microwave remote sensing based Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) retrievals derived from daily time series brightness temperature (T-b) measurements from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on EOS (AMSR-E) and other ancillary data inputs. The VOD parameter derives vegetation canopy attenuation at a given microwave frequency (18.7 GHz) and varies with canopy height, density, structure and water content. An error sensitivity analysis indicates that the retrieval algorithm can resolve the VOD seasonal cycle over a majority of global vegetated land areas. The VOD results corresponded favorably (p < 0.01) with vegetation indices (VIs) and leaf area index (lid) information from satellite optical-infrared (MODIS) remote sensing, and phenology cycles determined from a simple bioclimatic growing season index (GSI) for over 82% of the global domain. Lower biomass land cover classes (e.g. savannas) show the highest correlations (R=0.66), with reduced correspondence at higher biomass levels (0.03 < R < 0.51) and higher correlations for homogeneous land cover areas (0.41 < R < 0.83). The VOD results display a unique end-of-season signal relative to VI and LAI series, and may reflect microwave sensitivity to the timing of vegetation biomass depletion (e.g. leaf abscission) and associated changes in canopy water content (e.g. dormancy preparation). The VOD parameter is independent of and synergistic with optical-infrared remote sensing based vegetation metrics, and contributes to a more comprehensive view of land surface phenology.

AB Remotely sensed vegetation indices are widely used to detect greening and browning trends: especially the global coverage of time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data which are available from 1981. Seasonality and serial auto-correlation in the data have previously been dealt with by integrating the data to annual values; as an alternative to reducing the temporal resolution, we apply harmonic analyses and non-parametric trend tests to the GIMMS NDVI dataset (1981-2006). Using the complete dataset, greening and browning trends were analyzed using a linear model corrected for seasonality by subtracting the seasonal component, and a seasonal non-parametric model. In a third approach, phenological shift and variation in length of growing season were accounted for by analyzing the time-series using vegetation development stages rather than calendar days. Results differed substantially between the models, even though the input data were the same. Prominent regional greening trends identified by several other studies were confirmed but the models were inconsistent in areas with weak trends. The linear model using data corrected for seasonality showed similar trend slopes to those described in previous work using linear models on yearly mean values. The non-parametric models demonstrated the significant influence of variations in phenology; accounting for these variations should yield more robust trend analyses and better understanding of vegetation trends.

AB Uncontrolled coal fires can result in massive surface displacements due to the change in volume of burning coal and thermal effects in the adjacent rock mass; simultaneously, the resultant surface breakings provide greater access to air and water that in turn can aggravate the problem of underground coal seam burning. In this case study, we have investigated the feasibility and potential of detecting the land subsidence accompanying coal fires by means of satellite InSAR observations. Three groups of small-baseline InSAR approaches (PSI, stacking and 2-passDInSAR) were applied to the Wuda coalfield (Northern China) to reveal the spatial and temporal signals of the land subsidence in the areas affected by the coal fires. The interferometric results agree well with GPS observations and coal fire data obtained by field investigation, which demonstrates that the small-baseline InSAR techniques have remarkable potential to detect this land subsidence of interest. In particular, our results show that the development of coal fires can lead to new subsiding areas and also accelerate the ongoing surface subsidence, typically within the areas of mature coal fires, through a comparison of the interferometric observations and the multi-temporal coal fire maps. This timely and reliable information on land subsidence will be useful for the detection and mapping of the coal fire affected regions and thereby assist in fighting and controlling coal seam burning.

AB Drought is one of the most frequent climate-related disasters occurring across large portions of the African continent, often with devastating consequences for the food security of agricultural households. This study proposes a novel method for calculating the empirical probability of having a significant proportion of the total agricultural area affected by drought at sub-national level. First, we used the per-pixel Vegetation Health Index (VHI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) averaged over the crop season as main drought indicator. A phenological model based on NDVI was employed for defining the start of season (SOS) and end of the grain filling stage (GFS) dates. Second, the per-pixel average VHI was aggregated for agricultural areas at sub-national level in order to obtain a drought intensity indicator. Seasonal VHI averaging according to the phenological model proved to be a valid drought indicator for the African continent, and is highly correlated with the drought events recorded during the period (1981-2009). The final results express the empirical probability of drought occurrence over both the temporal and the spatial domain, representing a promising tool for future drought monitoring.

AB We studied sea surface temperature (SST) retrieval algorithms for Sendai Bay, using output from the thermal-infrared channels of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) on board Terra. While the highest resolutions of other satellite SST products are about 1 km, the ASTER thermal-infrared channels provide 90-m spatial resolution. To develop the ASTER algorithm, we employed statistical methods in which SSTs retrieved from the thermal-infrared measurements were tuned against the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST product with a 1-km spatial resolution. Terra also carries a MODIS sensor, which observed the same area as the ASTER sensor at the same time. The MODIS SST was validated around Sendai Bay, revealing a bias of -0.15 degrees C and root mean-square difference (RMSD) of 0.67 degrees C against in situ SSTs. Taking into account the spatial-resolution difference between ASTER and MODIS, match-up was generated only if the variability of ASTER brightness temperatures (T-13) was small in a pixel of MODIS SST (MP). The T-13 within one MP was about 121 pixels. The standard deviation (sigma(13)) of T-13 was calculated for each cloud-free MP, and the threshold of sigma(13) for choosing match-up MPs was decided by analyzing the sigma(13) histogram of one ASTER image. The 15 synchronous pairs of ASTER/MODIS images are separated into two groups of 8 pairs called set (A) and 7 pairs called set (B). Using the common procedure, the match-ups are generated for set (A) and set (B). The former is used for developing the ASTER Multi-Channel SST (MCSST) algorithm, and the latter for validation of the developed ASTER SST. Analysis of the whole 15 pairs indicated that ASTER SST does not depend on the satellite zenith angle. We concluded that, using Akaike's information criterion with set (A) match-ups, the multiple regression formula with all five thermal-infrared channels was adequate for the ASTER SST retrieval. Validation of ASTER SST using match-up set (B) indicated a bias of 0.101 degrees C and RMSD of 0.455 degrees C. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Real-time/near real-time inversion of land surface biogeophysical variables from satellite observations is required to monitor rapid land surface changes, and provide the necessary input for numerical weather forecasting models and decision support systems. This paper develops a new inversion method for the real-time estimation of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of land surfaces from MODIS time series reflectance data (MOD09A1). It consists of a series of procedures, including time series data smoothing, data quality control and real-time estimation of LAI. After the historical LAI time series is smoothed by a multi-step Savitzky-Golay filter to determine the upper LAI envelope, a Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is used to derive the LAI climatology. Based on the climatology from the SARIMA model to evolve in time, a dynamic model is then constructed and used to provide the short-range forecast of LAI. Predictions from this model are used with Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) techniques to recursively update biophysical variables as new observations arrive. The validation results produced using MODIS surface reflectance data and field-measured LAI data at eight BELMANIP sites show that the real-time inversion method is able to efficiently produce a relatively smooth LAI product. In addition, the accuracy is significantly improved over the MODIS LAI product. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Herbaceous aquatic macrophytes cover extensive areas on the floodplains of the Amazon basin and are an important habitat and input of organic carbon. These communities have large intra- and inter-annual variability, and characterization of this variability is necessary to quantify the role of macrophytes in the ecology and biogeochemistry of the floodplain. A novel approach for mapping the temporal evolution of aquatic vegetation in the Amazon floodplain, which could be adapted to other spatially and temporally changing environments, is presented Macrophyte cover varied seasonally and Inter-annually, ranging between 104 and 198 km(2) for the floodplain examined (total area, 984 km(2)). The observed evolution of plant distribution indicated a spatial and temporal partition of macrophyte communities into short-lived and annual groups. A simulation of macrophyte net primary production (NPP) based on the mapping results indicated that at least 3% of NPP could be attributed to the short-lived communities. The present results suggest that significant changes in the macrophyte's contribution to carbon cycling in the Amazon floodplain could occur as a result of the predicted increase in frequency of drought years for the Amazon system due to climate change.

AB The interest of the scientific community in global climate has been constantly increasing in the last years. Much effort has been devoted to better understand the water cycle and its role in global climate regulation. This is one of the objectives of the European Space Agency (ESA) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, approved in May 1999 and successfully launched in November 2nd 2009. Collecting brightness temperature measurements by means of a new type of instrument, a synthetic aperture radiometer operating at L-Band (MIRAS: Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis), the SMOS mission will provide regular and global maps of sea surface salinity (SSS) and soil moisture (SM), two key parameters to describe the water cycle. Synthetic aperture brightness temperatures have been simulated since the early 90s, during the MIRAS technological studies, and both SSS and SM retrievals have been tested with simulated data first, and later with real data to assess and improve the instrument performance. Nevertheless, except for the processing of the data collected by the SMOSillo (MIRAS Demonstrator) on June 20th, 2006, Duffo et al. (2007) and Camps et al. (2008b), these outcomes have never been validated using sea surface brightness temperatures coming from a real synthetic aperture radiometer. The aim of this study is thus to test some of the techniques proposed in previous years to improve the SSS retrieval, in particular only Level 2 techniques (i.e. converting calibrated and geo-located brightness temperature into SSS maps) will be investigated. To do so, brightness temperatures resulting from the SMOS Salinity Demonstrator Campaign held in August 2007 will be used. In that campaign the Helsinki University of Technology-2 Dimensional (HUT-2D) radiometer flown over both over land and sea. The part of the campaign conducted over the sea consisted of two series of flights over a very fresh water plume characterized by a strong SSS gradient (from 0 to 4 psu) in the Gulf of Finland. In-situ auxiliary data was collected simultaneously with the radiometer measurements. The positive outcomes in these very challenging conditions (due to the very low brightness temperature sensitivity to SSS, the lack of accurate models of the sea water dielectric constant at low SSS (Klein & Swift (1977)), and the weak radiometric sensitivity of the HUT-2D radiometer) demonstrate the importance of data pre- and post-processing to improve the results. Removing both brightness temperature biases and salinity retrieval biases and further averaging of the results, permits estimating SSS with an rms error on the order of 1 psu, which is comparable to the SMOS Level 2 expected accuracy.

AB India has a diverse set of vegetation types ranging from tropical evergreen to dry deciduous. The phenology of these natural vegetation types is often controlled by climatic condition. Estimating phenological variables will help in understanding the response of tropical and subtropical vegetation to climate change. The study investigated the annual and inter-annual variation in vegetation phenology in India using satellite remote sensing. The study used time-series data of the only available satellite measured index of terrestrial chlorophyll content (MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index) from 2003 to 2007 at 4.6 km spatial resolution. A strong coincidence was observed with expected phenological pattern, in particular, in inter-annual and latitudinal variability of key phenological variables. For major natural vegetation type the onset of greenness had greater latitudinal variation compared to the end of senescence and there was a small or no leafless period. In the 2003-04 growing season a late start for the onset of greenness was detected at low-to-mid latitudes and it was attributed to the extreme cold weather during the early part of 2003. The length of growing season varied from east to west for the major cropping areas in the Indo-Gangetic plain, for both the first and second crops. For the first time, this study attempted to establish a broad regional phenological pattern for India using remotely sensed estimation of canopy chlorophyll content using five years of data. The overall patterns of phenological variables detected from this study broadly coincide with the pattern of natural vegetation phenology revealed in earlier community level studies. The results of this study suggest the need for an organised network combining ground and space observation which is at presently missing in India. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Uncertainties in burning efficiency (BE) estimates can lead to large errors in fire emission quantification (from 23% to 46%). One of the main causes of these errors is the spatial variability of fuel consumption within burned areas. This paper studies whether burn severity (BS) maps can be used to improve BE assessment. A burn severity map of two large fires in California was obtained by inverting a simulation model constrained by post-fire observations from Landsat TM imagery. Model output values of BS were validated against field measurements, obtaining a high correlation (R-2=0.85) and low errors (Root Mean Square Error, RMSE=0.14) throughout a wide range of BS levels. The BS map obtained was then used to adjust BE reference values per vegetation type found in the area before the fire. The adjusted burning efficiency (BEadj) was compared to the burned biomass, which was estimated by subtracting vegetation indices from pre- and post-fire images. Results showed a high correlation for conifers (R-2=0.75) and hardwoods (R-2=0.73), and a moderate correlation (R-2 similar to 0.5) for shrubs and grasslands. In general, for all vegetation types BEadj performed better (R-2=0.4-0.75) than literature-based BE (R-2<0.0001). This study demonstrates: (i) the consistency of the simulation model inversion for BS estimation in temperate ecosystems, and (ii) the improvement of BE estimation when the spatial variability of the combustion was quantified in terms of BS.

AB Mapping plant species composition of mixed vegetation stands with remote sensing is a complicated task. Uncertainties may arise from similar spectral signatures of different plant species as well as from variable influences of prevailing plant states (e.g., growth stages, vigor, or stress levels). Despite these uncertainties, empirical approaches may often be able to take up the challenge. However, their performance is likely to be affected by the temporal variability of empirical relations between reflectance and plant species composition. To assess some aspects of this temporal variability, we performed a greenhouse study. Three mixed stands of grassland species were planted with defined spatial variation in species proportions. The canopy reflectance of these mixed stands was measured with a field spectrometer over a period of three months. Confounding external influences on plant states apart from maturation were minimized.
   The suitability of canopy reflectance and derivative reflectance to draw conclusions on differences in qualitative species mixtures between the stands was tested with a classification approach (Spectral Angle Mapper, SAM). Procrustean randomization test (PROTEST), which is to our knowledge new to the field of remote sensing, was applied in combination with Isometric Feature Mapping to quantify the spectral variation caused by within-stand spatial variation in species proportions. Model fits in both analyses increased with progressing plant development; further, utilization of derivative reflectance improved the model fits. Regardless of the within-stand variation, SAM enabled a successful discrimination of the three stands with an average overall accuracy of 85% (reflectance) and 92% (derivative reflectance). In PROTEST analysis, spatial variation in reflectance was successfully related to within-stand variation in species proportions. However, observed influences of variable growth stages and health states on these relations were considerable. The temporal variation of these relations (r=0.27-0.73 for reflectance and 0.48-0.73 for derivative reflectance) was quantified for the first time under controlled conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Many studies have assessed the process of forest degradation in the Brazilian Amazon using remote sensing approaches to estimate the extent and impact by selective logging and forest fires on tropical rain forest. However, only a few have estimated the combined impacts of those anthropogenic activities. We conducted a detailed analysis of selective logging and forest fire impacts on natural forests in the southern Brazilian Amazon state of Mato Grosso, one of the key logging centers in the country. To achieve this goal a 13-year series of annual Landsat images (1992-2004) was used to test different remote sensing techniques for measuring the extent of selective logging and forest fires, and to estimate their impact and interaction with other land use types occurring in the study region. Forest canopy regeneration following these disturbances was also assessed. Field measurements and visual observations were conducted to validate remote sensing techniques. Our results indicated that the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index aerosol free (MSAVI(af)) is a reliable estimator of fractional coverage under both clear sky and under smoky conditions in this study region. During the period of analysis, selective logging was responsible for disturbing the largest proportion (31%) of natural forest in the study area, immediately followed by deforestation (29%). Altogether, forest disturbances by selective logging and forest fires affected approximately 40% of the study site area. Once disturbed by selective logging activities, forests became more susceptible to fire in the study site. However, our results showed that fires may also occur in undisturbed forests. This indicates that there are further factors that may increase forest fire susceptibility in the study area. Those factors need to be better understood. Although selective logging affected the largest amount of natural forest in the study period, 35% and 28% of the observed losses of forest canopy cover were due to forest fire and selective logging combined and to forest fire only, respectively. Moreover, forest areas degraded by selective logging and forest fire is an addition to outright deforestation estimates and has yet to be accounted for by land use and land cover change assessments in tropical regions. Assuming that this observed trend of land use and land cover conversion continues, we predict that there will be no undisturbed forests remaining by 2011 in this study site. Finally, we estimated that 70% of the total forest area disturbed by logging and fire had sufficiently recovered to become undetectable using satellite data in 2004. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB While forest inventories based on airborne laser scanning data (ALS) using the area based approach (ABA) have reached operational status, methods using the individual tree crown approach (ITC) have basically remained a research issue. One of the main obstacles for operational applications of ITC is biased results often experienced due to segmentation errors. In this article, we propose a new method, called "semi-ITC" that overcomes the main problems related to ITC by imputing ground truth data within crown segments from the nearest neighboring segment. This may be none, one, or several trees. The distances between segments were derived based on a set of explanatory variables using two nonparametric methods, i.e., most similar neighbor inference (MSN) and random forest (RF). RF favored the imputation of common observations in the data set which resulted in significant biases. Main conclusions are therefore based on MSN. The explanatory variables were calculated by means of small footprint ALS and multispectral data. When testing with empirical data the new method compared favorably to the well-known ABA. Another advantage of the new method over the ABA is that it allowed for the modeling of rare tree species. The results of predicting timber volume with the semi-ITC method were unbiased and the root mean squared error (RMSE) on plot level was smaller than the standard deviation of the observed response variables. The relative RMSEs after cross validation using semi-ITC for total volume and volume of the individual species pine, spruce, birch, and aspen on plot level were 17, 38, 40, 101, and 222%, respectively. Due to the unbiasedness of the estimation, this study is a showcase for how to use crown segments resulting from ITC algorithms in a forest inventory context. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB A methodology for the assessment of fruit quality in crops subjected to different irrigation regimes is presented. High spatial resolution multispectral and thermal airborne imagery were used to monitor crown temperature and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) over three commercial orchards comprising peach, nectarine and orange fruit trees during 2008. Irrigation regimes included sustained and regulated deficit irrigation strategies, leading to high variability of fruit quality at harvest. Stem water potential was used to monitor individual tree water status on each study site. Leaf samples were collected for destructive sampling of xanthophyll pigments to assess the relationship between the xanthophyll epoxidation state (EPS) and PRI at leaf and airborne-canopy level. At harvest, fruit size, Total Soluble Solids (TSS) and Tritatable Acidity (TA) were measured to characterize fruit quality. A statistically significant relationship between EPS and PRI was found at the leaf (r(2) = 0.81) and canopy level (r(2) = 0.41). Airborne-derived crown PRI calculated from the imagery acquired during the fruit growth was related to the ratio of the total soluble solids normalized by the tritatable acidity (TSS/TA), an indicator of fruit quality measured on the same trees, yielding a coefficient of determination of r(2) = 0.50. The relationship between the integral of PRI time-series and TSS/TA yielded a coefficient of determination of r(2) = 0.72 (peach) and r(2) = 0.61 (nectarines). On the contrary, the relation between TSS/TA and the time-series of crown thermal imagery was very weak (r(2) = 0.21 and 0.25 respectively). These results suggest that a physiological remote sensing indicator related to photosynthesis, such as PRI, is more appropriate for fruit quality assessment than crown temperature, the established method of water stress detection, which is more related to crown transpiration. A radiative transfer modelling study was conducted to assess the potential validity of this methodology for fruit quality assessment when using medium spatial resolution imagery. The analysis shows important effects of soil and shadows on the PRI vs EPS relationship used for fruit quality assessment if non-pure crown reflectance was extracted from the imagery.

AB Assessments of hurricane-induced environmental impacts are important to coastal management and risk analysis of ecosystems. In this study, a previously-developed remote sensing model for non-hurricane conditions by Wang et al. [Wang, H. Q. Hladik, C. M., Milla, K., Huang, W. R., Edmiston, L, Harwell, M. A., & Schalles, J. F. (in press). Detecting and mapping water quality indicators in Apalachicola Bay, Florida using MODIS Terra 250-m imagery. International Journal of Remote Sensing] has been substantially enhanced to investigate the impact of Hurricane Frances on total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, USA. The remote sensing model uses 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to map TSS concentrations in the Bay. Eleven additional satellite imageries of MODIS were used in the model improvement and calibration. TSS concentration computation in the present model has been substantially improved by using a two-step process: firstly producing atmospheric correction intercept by an approach of in-water reflectance regression, and then building the regression model (R-2 = 0.8534, n = 25) between 250-m MODIS reflectance and observed TSS concentrations, which includes an extreme high TSS concentration data of 208 mg/L for severe storm or hurricane condition. Also, we carried out the validation of model (RMSE = 5.5 mg/L, n = 21). MODIS-derived TSS maps show substantial increases of TSS concentrations in the Bay during the passage of Hurricane Frances (the average TSS and maximum concentration about 54.3 mg/L and 165 mg/L in the Bay respectively) compared to under no-storm or -hurricane condition ( the average TSS and maximum concentration were approximately 24-27 mg/L and 58-64 mg/L. In comparison to those before and 5-days after the passage of the hurricane, the average TSS concentration in the Bay was twice higher while the maximum TSS concentration increased almost three times during the hurricane. This indicates that strong winds during the hurricane have caused strong sediment re-suspension. The spatial variations of TSS concentrations were analyzed by applying the hydrodynamic characteristics of wind-induced flow and tidal currents as described by Huang [Huang, W., Jones, K., & Wu, T. (2002). Modeling surface wind effects on subtidal salinity in Apalachicola Bay. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science, 55(1), 33-46; Huang, W., Sun, H. Nnaji, S., & Jones, K (2002). Tidal hydrodynamics in a multiple inlet estuary: Apalachicola Bay. International Journal of Coastal Research, 18 (4), 674-684], which show westward currents in the Bay under westward wind condition. Therefore, the southwestward wind (about 50 degrees from the north) during the hurricane induced southwestward currents and transport that resulted in the high TSS concentrations near West Pass in the Bay and the Gulf. Within the Bay, TSS concentrations were generally higher in the southern portion of the Bay, which was due mainly to transport by the combination of southwestward wind and southward residual flow from the Apalachicola River.

AB The main objective of the current paper is to evaluate and explain differences between computed green-up dates of vegetated land surface derived from satellite observations and budburst dates from ground observational networks. Landscapes dominated by deciduous broad-leaved trees in Germany are analysed. While ground observations generally record the onset of bud break, remote sensing refers to a detectable change of surface reflectance, which accounts for the unfolding of the majority of the leaves. The satellite detects, even in a homogeneous stand, two signals: the green-up of the understorey and, shortly after, the green-up of the canopy (overstorey). Results of comparisons indicate an earlier, although not consistently, satellite-derived green-up than bud break derived from ground observations.
   We hypothesise that this is due to heterogeneous ground cover and a detection of the greening of non-tree vegetation by the satellite. This hypothesis is tested by analysing the difference between satellite-derived green-up dates (d(GU)) and budburst observed on the ground (d(BB)) in function of the proportion of non-deciduous-forest (ndf) land use types in satellite scenes. The satellite data (a daily 1-km resolution AVHRR product) are analysed with progressively more restricted selection criteria regarding the land surface elements. The two sets of observations are compared using Gaussian Mixture Models to evaluate the statistical properties of the probability density functions (pdf) as produced by the two sets rather than comparisons of geographically coincident data. It is shown that a heterogeneous vegetation cover is likely to be the main factor determining the difference between the computed green-up date and date of budburst of the dominating tree species.

AB In this study retrievals of forest canopy height were obtained through adjustment of a simple geometric-optical (GO) model against red band surface bidirectional reflectance estimates from NASA's Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), mapped to a 250 m grid. The soil-understory background contribution was partly isolated prior to inversion using regression relationships with the isotropic, geometric, and volume scattering kernel weights of a Li-Ross kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model. The height retrievals were assessed using discrete return lidar data acquired over sites in Colorado as part of the Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX) and used with fractional crown cover retrievals to obtain aboveground woody biomass estimates. For all model runs with reasonable backgrounds and initial b/r (vertical to horizontal crown radii) values <2.0, root mean square error (RMSE) distributions were centered between 2.5 and 3.7 m while R-2 distributions were centered between 0.4 and 0.7. The MISR/GO aboveground biomass estimates predicted via regression on fractional cover and mean canopy height for the CLPX sites showed good agreement with U.S. Forest Service Interior West map data (adjusted R-2 = 0.84). The implication is that multiangle sensors such as MISR can provide spatially contiguous retrievals of forest canopy height, cover, and aboveground woody biomass that are potentially useful in mapping distributions of aboveground carbon stocks, tracking disturbance, and in initializing, constraining, and validating ecosystem models. This is important because the MISR record is spatially comprehensive and extends back to the year 2000 and the launch of the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite; it might thus provide a similar to 10-year baseline record that would enhance exploitation of data from the NASA Deformation, Ecosystem Structure and Dynamics of Ice (DESDynl) mission, as well as furthering realization of synergies with active instruments.

AB Present sun glint removal methods overcorrect data collected in very shallow (less than 2 m) waters if the sensors used do not have bands in far infrared part of the spectrum. The reason is assuming of zero water leaving signal at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths. This assumption is not valid in very shallow waters, but also in areas where aquatic vegetation reaches water surface and in case of phytoplankton blooms that reach very high biomass or form surface scum. We propose an alternative method that can be used for successful glint removal even if the sensor does not have spectral bands beyond 800 nm. The proposed method utilises the presence and depth of the oxygen absorption feature near 760 nm as an indicator of glint contamination. This method allows removing sun glint from hyperspectral imagery preserving shape and magnitude of reflectance spectra in the cases where the negligible water leaving NIR signal is not valid.

AB New model-based estimators of the uncertainty of pixel-level and areal k-nearest neighbour (k(nn)) predictions of attribute Y from remotely-sensed ancillary data X are presented. Non-parametric functions predict Y from scalar 'Single Index Model' transformations of X Variance functions generated estimates of the variance of Y. Three case studies, with data from the Forest Inventory and Analysis program of the U.S. Forest Service, the Finnish National Forest Inventory, and Landsat EfM+ ancillary data, demonstrate applications of the proposed estimators. Nearly unbiased k(nn) predictions of three forest attributes were obtained. Estimates of mean square error indicate that k(nn) is an attractive technique for integrating remotely-sensed and ground data for the provision of forest attribute maps and areal predictions.

TI Bayesian analysis of thematic map accuracy data
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Bayesian; Thematic accuracy assessment
AB The analysis of thematic accuracy of maps and classifications relies on the interpretation of the error matrix. The statistical basis of the analysis has to date been from a frequentist point of view. An alternative Bayesian approach, described here, has a number of attractive features. Perhaps most importantly. it allows us to combine prior information in our analyses. The interpretation of the Bayesian estimates and intervals is also more intuitive, and because our inferences revolve around a posterior distribution, we are able to summarise estimates even after complicated transformations. Two novel plots summarising the accuracy of a map are also introduced. The approach is illustrated by analysing accuracy data from a land use map for the Baffle catchment in Queensland. Australia. Analysis is carried out using a non-informative prior and an informative prior based on data previously collected for a neighbouring catchment. The use of the informative prior tended to increase the precision of key accuracy parameters. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS) sensors on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites image most of the Earth multiple times each day, providing useful data on fires that cannot be practically acquired using other means. Unfortunately, current fire products from MODIS and other sensors leave large uncertainties in measurements of fire sizes and temperatures, which strongly influence how fires spread, the amount and chemistry of their gas and aerosol emissions, and their impacts on ecosystems. In this study, we use Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) to retrieve subpixel fire sizes and temperatures from MODIS, possibly overcoming some limitations of existing methods for characterizing fire intensities such as estimating the fire radiative power (FRP). MESMA is evaluated using data from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) to assess the performance of FRP and MESMA retrievals of fire properties from a simultaneously acquired MODIS image, for a complex of fires in Ukraine from August 21, 2002. The MESMA retrievals of fire size described in this paper show a slightly stronger correlation than FRP does to fire pixel counts from the coincident ASTER image. Prior to this work, few studies, if any, had used MESMA for retrieving fire properties from a broad-band sensor like MODIS, or compared MESMA to higher-resolution fire data or other measures of fire properties like FRP. In the future, MESMA retrievals could be useful for fire spread modeling and forecasting, reducing hazards that fires pose to property and health, and enhancing scientific understanding of fires and their effects oil ecosystems and atmospheric composition.

AB This article aims at finding efficient hyperspectral indices for the estimation of forest sun leaf chlorophyll content (CHL, mu g cm(leaf)(-2)), sun leaf mass per area (LMA, g(dry) (matter) m(leaf)(-2)), canopy leaf area index (LAI, m(leaf)(2) m(soil)(-2)) and leaf canopy biomass (B-leaf, g(dry) (matter) m(soil)(-2)). These parameters are useful inputs for forest ecosystem simulations at landscape scale. The method is based on the determination of the best vegetation indices (index form and wavelengths) using the radiative transfer model PROSAIL (formed by the newly-calibrated leaf reflectance model PROSPECT coupled with the multi-layer version of the canopy radiative transfer model SAIL). The results are tested on experimental measurements at both leaf and canopy scales. At the leaf scale, it is possible to estimate CHL with high precision using a two wavelength vegetation index after a simulation based calibration. At the leaf scale, the LMA is more difficult to estimate with indices. At the canopy scale, efficient indices were determined on a generic simulated database to estimate CHL, LMA, LAI and Bleaf in a general way. These indices were then applied to two Hyperion images (50 plots) on the Fontainebleau and Fougeres forests and portable spectroradiometer measurements. They showed good results with an RMSE of 8.2 mu g cm(-2) for CHL, 9.1 g m(-2) for LMA, 1.7 m(2) m(-2) for LAI and 50.6 g m(-2) for Bleaf. However, at the canopy scale, even if the wavelengths of the calibrated indices were accurately determined with the simulated database, the regressions between the indices and the biophysical characteristics still had to be calibrated on measurements. At the canopy scale, the best indices were: for leaf chlorophyll content: NDchl (rho(925)-rho(710))/(rho(925)+rho(710)), for leafmass per area: NDLMA = (rho(2260)-rho(1490))/(rho(2260)+rho(1490)), for leaf area index: DLAI=rho(1725)-rho(970), and for canopy leaf biomass: NDBleaf = (rho(2160)-rho(1540))/(rho(2160)+rho(1540)).

AB The use of remote sensing techniques in monitoring inland waters has become a powerful tool, considering the amount of ungauged waterbodies all over the world. The water mass balance is an essential subject to take into account in water management activities. The level changes of a lake Surface are an indicator of the water mass balance of a basin since they reflect the water storage variations. Space borne altimeters have been Successfully used in the last decade to measure lakes, rivers and wetland stages. This study presents the first analysis of Lake Izabal - the biggest lake of Guatemala (Central America) - water level fluctuations using altimetry, data and in-situ measurements. Water level variations were obtained from Envisat Radar Altimeter (RA-2) Geophysical Data Records Coupled with in-situ measurements. The analysis period included three complete years (2004 to 2006). The rainfall and temperature records over the catchment were analyzed considering that the amount of water feeding the lake, either by the tributaries and/or the groundwater, is driven by the climatic conditions over the lake's catchment. The results obtained show a good agreement between both, altimeter and in-situ datasets (correlation coefficient: 0.83 and rms error: 0.09 m). Lake Izabal water level fluctuations have a seasonal signal forced by the rainy and dry climate seasons in the region. An abrupt lake level rise was found in July 2006 which is correlated to abnormal precipitations in June. We found a connection between the higher/lower extreme values in the lake level variations with rainfall anomalies produced by regional climate changes forced by El Nino Southern Oscillation and the Tropical North Atlantic anomaly.

AB A time series of burned land areas was generated for a 23 year period (1984-2006) using 10-day composites of AVHRR data. The study area covers 1.6 million km(2) of boreal forest in western Canada. The algorithm was intended to be consistent throughout the Study period and region, and to avoid commission errors, so as to obtain a reliable sample of temporal trends in burned area in the region. The algorithm relies on temporal comparisons of several spectral indices (GEMI, BAI), as well as near infrared reflectance. It emphasizes the stability of the post-fire signal, to avoid false detections associated with cloud, cloud shadows, missed data and radiometric or geometric calibration between AVHRR sensors. Final results show a very consistent temporal adjustment to official statistics and fire perimeters, with very low commission error (< 10%), but medium to high omission error (50%). Burned areas in the region were predominantly associated with coniferous forest cover, with the Taiga and Boreal Shield ecozones, in latitudes between 56 and 60 degrees N, and predominantly at long distances from populated places.

AB A series of diurnal airborne campaigns were conducted over an orchard field to assess the canopy Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) as an indicator of water stress. Airborne campaigns over two years were conducted with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) over an orchard field to investigate changes in PRI, in the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (TCARI) normalized by the Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) (TCARI/OSAVI), and in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as function of field-measured physiological indicators of water stress, such as stomatal conductance, stem water potential, steady-state fluorescence, and crown temperature. The AHS sensor was flown at three times on each 2004 and 2005 years, collecting 2 m spatial resolution imagery in 80 spectral bands in the 0.43-12.5 mu m spectral range. Indices PRI, TCARI/OSAVI, and NDVI were calculated from reflectance bands, and thermal bands were assessed for the retrieval of land surface. temperature, separating pure crowns from shadows and sunlit soil pixels. The Photochemical Reflectance Index, originally developed for xanthophyll cycle pigment change detection was calculated to assess its relationship with water stress at a canopy level, and more important, to assess canopy structural and viewing geometry effects for water stress detection in diurnal airborne experiments. The FLIGHT 3D canopy reflectance model was used to simulate the bi-directional reflectance changes as function of the viewing geometry, background and canopy structure. This manuscript demonstrates that the airborne-level PRI index is sensitive to the de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll pigment cycle caused by water stress levels, but affected diurnally by the confounding effects of BRDF. Among the three vegetation indices calculated, only airborne PRI demonstrated sensitivity to diurnal changes in physiological indicators of water stress, such as canopy temperature minus air temperature (Tc-Ta), stomatal conductance (G), and stem water potential (psi) measured in the field at the time of each image acquisition. No relationships were found from the diurnal experiments between NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI with the tree-measured physiological measures. FLIGHT model simulations of PRI demonstrated that PRI is highly affected by the canopy structure and background. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Arctic region is predicted to experience considerable climatic and environmental changes as the global atmospheric CO2 increases. Growing awareness of the role of tundra and taiga ecosystems and their transition zone in the climate change process has resulted in a recent increase in remote sensing studies focusing on the Arctic latitudes. Remote sensing of biophysical properties of the canopy layer in the forested part of the region is often, however, challenged by the dominating role of the understory in the spectral signal. In this paper, we examine the influence of understory vegetation on forest reflectance in the Arctic region of Finland during no-snow conditions. The study is based on SPOT HRVIR images, field goniospectrometry, 300 ground reference plots and a physically-based forest reflectance model (PARAS). The results indicate that lichen-dominated forest site types can be distinguished from sites dominated by dwarf shrubs. The paper also contains results from applying an analytical method for calculating photon recollision probability from canopy transmittance data for forest stands, and then using it to simulate the reflectance of the same stands.

AB A comprehensive set of bio-optical measurements collected at the Acqua Alta Oceanographic Tower site in the northern Adriatic Sea is used to assess satellite derived optical properties and concentrations of optically significant constituents. These include normalized water leaving radiance spectra L-WN, absorption spectra due to phytoplankton, non-pigmented particles and chromophoric dissolved organic matter, back-scattering spectra, concentrations of chlorophyll a, Chla, and total suspended matter, TSM, and diffuse attenuation coefficients, K-d, obtained with a diverse set of algorithms. A total of 81 and 21 match-ups are found for SeaWiFS and MODIS L-WN, respectively. For both sensor products, the match-ups show mean absolute percentage differences of approximately 30% at 412 nm, 20% at 443 nm, and 14% from 490 to 555 nm. Some dependence of these differences has been found with respect to the aerosol optical thickness and the single scattering albedo associated with the in-water constituents. However, the performance of the atmospheric correction scheme appears relatively robust with respect to angular and environmental conditions. The different Chla products generally show quite large uncertainties whereas a TSM product shows encouraging results. Three algorithms produce Kd (490) with a RMS uncertainty of 0.13 for log-transformed data. The comparison between in situ data and satellite derived absorption values yields varying levels of uncertainties for the three bio-optical algorithms considered here and for the different wavelengths. Preliminary improvements could be reached by reducing biases affecting the total absorption coefficient at various wavelengths. Another general result is that the bio-optical models are able to represent a larger part of the observed variability for phytoplankton absorption than for the absorption by dissolved and non-pigmented particulate matter. The assumed spectral shape of the latter absorption term appears logically as a strong determinant of the partition of the total absorption. The three sets of satellite derived back-scattering spectra compare favorably with in situ optical measurements, with mean RMS differences between 0.12 and 0.18. Importantly, the uncertainties obtained here for satellite match-ups of absorption coefficients are comparable to published estimates of the inherent uncertainties associated with the bio-optical algorithms.

AB Forest dynamics are characterized by both continuous (i.e., growth) and discontinuous (i.e., disturbance) changes. Change detection techniques that use optical remotely sensed data to capture disturbance related changes are established and commonly applied; however, approaches for the capture of continuous forest changes are less mature. Optical remotely sensed imagery is well suited for capturing horizontally distributed conditions, structures, and changes, while Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) data are more appropriate for capturing vertically distributed elements of forest structure and change. The integration of optical remotely sensed imagery and LIDAR data provides improved opportunities to fully characterize forest canopy attributes and dynamics. The study described in this paper captures forest conditions along a corridor approximately 600 km long through the boreal forest of Canada. Two coincident LIDAR transects, representing 1997 and 2002 forest conditions respectively, are compared using image segments generated from Landsat ETM+ imagery. The image segments are used to provide a spatial framework within which the attributes and temporal dynamics of the forest canopy are estimated and compared. Segmented and classified Landsat imagery provides a context for the comparison of sufficiently spatially related LIDAR profiles and for the provision of categories to aid in the application of empirical models requiring knowledge of land cover. Global and local approaches were employed for characterizing changes in forest attributes over time. The global approach, emphasized the overall trend in forest change along the length of the entire transect, and indicated that key canopy attributes were stable, and transect characteristics, including forest canopy height, did not change significantly over the five-year period of this study (two sample t-test, p=0.08). The local approach analyzed segment-based changes in canopy attributes, providing spatially explicit indications of forest growth and depletion. The local approach identified that 84% of the Landsat segments intercepted by both LIDAR transects either have no change, or have a small average increase in canopy height (0.7 m), while the other 16% of segments have an average decrease in canopy height of 1.6 m. As expected, the difference in the magnitude of the changes was markedly greater for depletions than it was for growth, but was less spatially extensive. Growth tends to occur incrementally over broad areas; whereas, depletions are dramatic and spatially constrained. The approach presented holds potential for investigating the impacts of climate change across a latitudinal gradient of boreal forest. Crown Copyright (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Accurate remote assessment of phytoplankton chlorophyll a (chla) concentration is particularly challenging in turbid, productive waters. Recently a conceptual model containing reflectance in three spectral bands in the red and near infra-red range of the spectrum was suggested for retrieving chla concentrations in turbid productive waters; it was calibrated and validated in lakes and reservoirs in Nebraska and Iowa. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the performance of this three band model as well as its special case, the two-band model to estimate chla concentration in Chesapeake Bay, as representative of estuarine Case II waters, and to assess the accuracy of chla retrieval. To evaluate the model performance, dual spectroradiometers were used to measure subsurface spectral radiance reflectance in the visible and near infra-red range of the spectrum. Water samples were collected concurrently and contained widely variable chla (9 to 77.4 mg/m(3)) and total suspended solids (7-65 mg/L dry wt). Colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption at 440 nm was 0.20 to 2.50 m(-1); Secchi disk transparency ranged from 0.28 to 1.5 m. The two- and three-band models were spectrally tuned to select the spectral bands for most accurate chla estimation. Strong linear relationships were established between analytically measured chla and both the three-band model [R-1(675)-R-1(695)] x R(730) and the two-band model R(720)/R(670), where R(lambda) is reflectance at wavelength lambda. The three-band model accounted for 81% of variation in chla and allowed estimation of chla with a root mean square error (RMSE) of less than 7.9 mg/m(3), whereas the two-band model accounted for 79% of chla variability and RMSE of chla estimation was below 8.4 mg/m(3). The three-band model with MERIS spectral bands allows accurate chla estimation with RMSE below 9.1 mg/m(3). Two-band model with SeaWiFS bands and MODIS 667 nm and 748 nm bands can estimate chla with RMSE below 11 mg/m(3). The findings underlined the rationale behind the conceptual model and demonstrated the robustness of this algorithm for chla retrieval in turbid, productive estuarine waters. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Imputations of missing values and optimal smoothing with massive data arrays poses a computational challenge since ordinary kriging becomes infeasible. Imputation and smoothing with standard algorithms like inverse distance weighted nearest neighbour interpolation (IDW) and interpolation on triangulated irregular networks (TIN/IP) fail to incorporate the spatial structure and ignore information beyond the neighbourhood. Multiresolution spatial models (MRSM) or approximate kriging methods adapted to handling massive data sets can be expected to do better than IDW and TIN/IP in terms of mean square errors of prediction (MSEP). We illustrate a MRSM that is efficient, computationally fast, and easy to implement. In two forestry examples with imputation of LiDAR range values the MRSM achieved a lower MSEP than IDW, TIN/IP, and fixed ranked kriging. MRSM appear as especially attractive for the construction of a DTM from last return LiDAR pulses. A third example demonstrates MRSM for efficient smoothing.

AB We examined the spatial and temporal variability of the Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) within Tampa Bay, Florida, using the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite imagery collected from September 1997 to December 2005. SDD was computed using a two-step process, first estimating the diffuse light attenuation coefficient at 490 nm, KJ490), using a semi-analytical algorithm and then SDD using an empirical relationship with K-d(490). The empirical SDD algorithm (SDD = 1.04 x K-d(490)(-0.82), 0.9<SDD<8.0 M, r(2) =0.67, n=80) is based on historical SDD observations collected by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) in Tampa Bay. SeaWiFS derived SDD showed distinctive seasonal variability, attributed primarily to chlorophyll concentrations and color in the rainy season and to turbidity in the dry season, which are in turn controlled by river runoff and winds or wind-induced sediment resuspension, respectively. The Bay also experienced strong interannual variability, mainly related to river runoff variability. As compared to in situ single measurements, the SeaWiFS data provide improved estimates of the "mean" water clarity conditions in this estuary because of the robust, frequent, and synoptic coverage. Therefore we recommend incorporation of this technique for routine monitoring of water quality in coastal and large estuarine waters like Tarnpa Bay. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An 18-year time series of monthly NOAA-AVHRR Pathfinder Land burned area was analyzed for the region of tropical Africa, from July 1981 to June 1999. The transition period between NOAA-11 and NOAA-14 platforms from July 1993 to June 1995 was not included due to missing and outlier data. Stability of the time series was addressed for the input variables in the burned area algorithm, reflectance and temperature channels.
   A Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving-Average (SARIMA) model was developed for forecasting potential burned area. The SARIMA model identified an autoregressive regular term with 1-month lag and an autoregressive 12-month seasonal term, with one season (12 months) component. A cross-correlation between Southern Oscillation Index (Sol) and burned area was statistically significant predictor variable in a time series with 20-month lag. Results show that the SARIMA model with this predictor improved both, fitting and forecasting, residual variance, by 4.1% and 5.6%, respectively, thereby, demonstrating potential relationship between SOI and burned area for the study region. Forecasting was estimated by considering only the first 16 years of the monthly burned area in the time series, from July 1981 to June 1997. The prediction for the following 24 months (from July 1997 to June 1999) was within the 95% confidence level indicating that the forecast was a valid characterization of the modeled process.

AB Large area land cover products generated from remotely sensed data are difficult to validate in a timely and cost effective manner. As a result, preexisting data are often used for validation. Temporal, spatial, and attribute differences between the land cover product and pre-existing validation data can result in inconclusive depictions of map accuracy. This approach may therefore misrepresent the true accuracy of the land cover product, as well as the accuracy of the validation data, which is not assumed to be without error. Hence, purpose-acquired validation data is preferred; however, logistical constraints often preclude its use - especially for large area land cover products. Airborne digital video provides a cost-effective tool for collecting purpose-acquired validation data over large areas. An operational trial was conducted, involving the collection of airborne video for the validation of a 31,000 km(2) sub-sample of the Canadian large area Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of Forests (EOSD) land cover map (Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada). In this trial, one form of agreement between the EOSD product and the airborne video data was defined as a match between the mode land cover class of a 3 by 3 pixel neighbourhood surrounding the sample pixel and the primary or secondary choice of land cover for the interpreted video. This scenario produced the highest level of overall accuracy at 77% for level 4 of classification hierarchy (13 classes). The coniferous treed class, which represented 71% of Vancouver Island, had an estimated user's accuracy of 86%. Purpose acquired video was found to be a useful and cost-effective data source for validation of the EOSD land cover product. The impact of using multiple interpreters was also tested and documented. Improvements to the sampling and response designs that emerged from this trial will benefit a full-scale accuracy assessment of the EOSD product and also provides insights for other regional and global land cover mapping programs.

The paper presents a rigorous approach for geometric and radiometric correction of SAR images. Using a digital elevation model, the imaging geometry is reconstructed and is used to perform geometric and radiometric correction of terrain induced distortions. The importance of a stringent radiometric correction based on the integration of the image brightness is emphasized. The approach guarantees that the energy contained in the image data is preserved throughout the geocoding process. The resulting backscattering images are fully terrain corrected and can be used for further quantitative investigations and may also improve qualitative studies as e.g. land cover classifications. The technique is applicable for different sensor types and image products, including already geocoded SAR images. The effect of different resolutions of digital elevation models used for the correction of the backscattering coefficient is investigated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID RADIATIVE-TRANSFER MODEL; OCEAN
AB A method is described for incorporating surface-emitted surface-reflected (SESR) radiation into the calculation of infrared sea surface emissivity. Firstly, the direct emissivity is obtained by ignoring SESR emission. Next, the first order SESR emissivity is obtained by using the direct emission as a radiation source. Finally, the ith order SESR emissivity is iteratively obtained by using the i-1st order SESR emission.
   Computational results are in good agreement with a Monte Carlo calculation, where the SESR emissivity increases from an emission angle of 50 degrees showing a maximum value of about 0.03 at an emission angle of 80 degrees. The direct emissivity is smaller than the measured emissivity by 0.02 similar to 0.03 around a wavelength of 10 mu m at an emission angle of 73.5 degrees. By incorporating the SESR emission into the emissivity model, the discrepancy between the computed and the measured emissivity is significantly reduced.
   The advantage of the present method over the previous works is that we need not to specify a cutoff angle to differentiate the radiation from the sea and that from the sky for calculating SESR emission. Instead of using a cutoff angle, the probability that radiation originates from the sea is derived from the probability distribution function of sea surface slope. As a result, the uncertainty in the computation of sea surface emissivity attributed to the uncertainty in cutoff angle could be effectively suppressed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Detecting and characterizing continuous changes in early forest succession using multi-temporal satellite imagery requires atmospheric correction procedures that are both operationally reliable, and that result in comparable units (e.g., surface reflectance). This paper presents a comparison of five atmospheric correction methods (2 relative, 3 absolute) used to correct a nearly continuous 20-year Landsat TM/ETM+ image data set (19-images) covering western Oregon (path/row 46/29). In theory, full absolute correction of individual images in a time-series should effectively minimize atmospheric effects resulting in a series of images that appears more similar in spectral response than the same set of uncorrected images. Contradicting this theory, evidence is presented that demonstrates how absolute correction methods such as Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6 s), Modified Dense Dark Vegetation (MDDV), and Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) actually make images in a time-series somewhat less spectrally similar to one another. Since the development of meaningful spectral reflectance trajectories is more dependant on consistent measurement of surface reflectance rather than on accurate estimation of true surface reflectance, correction using image pairs is also tested. The relative methods tested are variants of an approach referred to as "absolute-normalization", which matches images in a time-series to an atmospherically corrected reference image using pseudo-invariant features and reduced major axis (RMA) regression. An advantage of "absolute-normalization" is that all images in the time-series are converted to units of surface reflectance while simultaneously being corrected for atmospheric effects. Of the two relative correction methods used for "absolute-normalization", the first employed an automated ordination algorithm called multivariate alteration detection (MAD) to statistically locate pseudo-invariant pixels between each subject and reference image, while the second used analyst selected pseudo-invariant features (PIF) common to the entire image set. Overall, relative correction employed in the "absolute-normalization" context produced the most consistent temporal reflectance response, with the automated MAD algorithm performing equally as well as the handpicked PIFs. Although both relative methods performed nearly equally in terms of observed errors, several reasons emerged for preferring the MAD algorithm. The paper concludes by demonstrating how "absolute-normalization" improves (i.e., reduces scatter in) spectral reflectance trajectory models used for characterizing patterns of early forest succession.

AB The Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) series of instruments provides the meal's to obtain accurate measurements of sea surface temperature (SST), with a target total uncertainty of +/- 0.3 K, 1 sigma. In this paper, we present validation results from I year of comparisons between I kin resolution SSTs derived from the third instrument in the series, the Advanced ATSR (AATSR), and in situ measurements obtained during 2003 from the Marine-Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (M-AERI) over the Caribbean.
   Our dataset consists of 99 cloud-free matchups, 25 of which are two-channel SST retrievals (daytime) and 74 three-channel SST retrievals (nighttime). Validation results for both dual- and nadir-view SSTs for these matchups are presented. We demonstrate that the dual-nadir SST measurement difference (D-N) can be used to classify matchups and attribute the likely cause of a particularly high D-N to outbreaks of Saharan dust. Under conditions of 'normal' D-N, the bias and standard deviation of the two- and three-channel dual-view retrievals is -0.05 K and 0.26 K, and 0.02 K and 0.25 K, respectively. Dual-view SSTs obtained when the D-N is high over the Caribbean exhibit significant warm biases of 0.60 K and 0.32 K for two- and three-channel retrievals, respectively. Cool biases, with respect to the bias for 'normal' D-N, are observed in the nadir three-channel (N3) SSTs; for matchups with high D-N, the bias and standard deviation are - 0.16 K and 0.31 K, compared with 0.14 K and 0.24 K for 'normal' D-N. The distribution of the nadir two-channel retrievals is non-Gaussian and the apparent accuracy is comparatively poor, demonstrating clearly the advantages of using a sensor with dual-viewing capabilities to obtain a superior atmospheric correction, particularly when data from an additional short-wave infrared channel (e.g. at 3.7 mu m) is not available.

AB In Queensland, Australia, forest areas are discriminated from non-forest by applying a threshold (similar to 12%) to Landsat-derived Foliage Projected Cover (FPC) layers (equating to similar to 20% canopy cover), which are produced routinely for the State. However, separation of woody regrowth following agricultural clearing cannot be undertaken with confidence, and is therefore not mapped routinely by State Agencies. Using fully polarimetric C-, L- and P-band NASA AIRSAR and Landsat FPC data for forests and agricultural land near Injune, central Queensland, we corroborate that woody regrowth dominated by Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) cannot be discriminated using either FPC or indeed C-band data alone, because the rapid attainment of a canopy cover leads to similarities in both reflectance and backscatter with remnant forest. We also show that regrowth cannot be discriminated from non-forest areas using either L-band or P-band data alone. However, mapping can be achieved by thresholding and intersecting these layers, as regrowth is unique in supporting both a high FPC (> similar to 12%) and C-band SAR backscatter (>similar to -18 dB at HV polarisation) and low L-band and P-band SAR backscatter (e.g. <= similar to 14 dB at L-band HH polarisation). To provide a theoretical explanation, a wave scattering model based on that of Durden et al. [Durden, S.L., Van Zyl, J.J. & Zebker, H.A. (1989). Modelling and observation of radar polarization signature of forested areas. IEEE Trans. Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 27, 290-301.] was used to demonstrate that volume scattering from leaves and small branches in the upper canopy leads to increases in C-band backscattering, (particularly HV polatisations) from regrowth, which increases proportionally with FPC, By contrast, low L-band and P-band backscatter occurs because of the lack of double bounce interactions at co-polarisations (particularly HH) and volume scattering at HV polarisation from the stems and branches, respectively, when their dimensions are smaller than the wavelength. Regrowth maps generated by applying simple thresholds to both FPC and AIRSAR L-band data showed a very close correspondence with those mapped using same-date 2.5 m Hymap data and an average 73.7% overlap with those mapped through time-series comparison of Landsat-derived land cover classifications. Regrowth mapped using Landsat-derived FPC from 1995 and JER-1 SAR data from 1994 - 1995 also corresponded with areas identified within the time-series classification and true colour stereo photographs for the same period, The integration of Landsat FPC and L-band SAR data is therefore expected to facilitate regrowth mapping across Queensland and other regions of Australia, particularly as Japan's Advanced Land Observing System (ALOS) Phase Arrayed L-band SAR (PALSAR), to be launched in 2006, will observe at both L-band HH and HV polarisations.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of airborne multispectral and hyperspectral thermal infrared (TIR) image data for mapping surface minerals characteristic of active geothermal systems. TIR image data from the MASTER multispectral spectrometer and the SEBASS hyperspectral spectrometer were acquired over Steamboat Springs, Nevada, USA, in September 1999. Spectral emissivity information was extracted from the data and used to generate mineral maps. Using the MASTER data it was possible to map the extent of the active geothermal area as well as silica-rich vs. clay-rich areas. Using the SEBASS data the same areas could be mapped and additionally the presence of several minerals, including opal, quartz, alunite, anorthite, albite, and kaolinite could be identified. The SEBASS data also detected previously unidentified hydrous sulfate minerals (tamarugite and alunogen) forming around active fumaroles. Laboratory spectral data and XRD analyses of field samples confirmed the dominant mineral phases identified remotely. The airborne, field and laboratory data together with temperature anomaly and fumarole location data from other studies were synthesized and linked to the surface geology to determine the diagnostic surface mineral expression that could be mapped with TIR remotely sensed data for future exploration for similar geothermal systems. Opaline sinter deposits are the most diagnostic surface expression of hot spring activity at Steamboat Springs because they represent areas of the recent geyser activity. The differentiation between opal and chalcedony deposits and the identification of hydrous sulfate minerals forming around active fumaroles are also important because chalcedony represents ancient sinter deposits and hydrous sulfate minerals indicate locations of fumaroles that may be venting diffusely with no geyser activity. The surface expression of the geothermal system at Steamboat Springs is small, which emphasizes the need for high spatial resolution airborne imagers. The 90-m pixels of ASTER TIR data over the same area were only capable of resolving the area of past and recent sinter deposits together. MASTER multispectral TIR data covered the entire area (similar to 12 km(2)) at 5-m spatial resolution and were capable of defining the extent of the sinter deposits and zones of hydrothermally altered rocks. The SEBASS image swath was too narrow (256 in) to add significant spatial information to the overall map, but the high spectral content identified several important minerals related to the local geology and the mineralogic surface expression of the geothermal system.

AB Satellite data offer unrivaled utility in monitoring and quantifying large scale land cover change over time. Radiometric consistency among collocated multi-temporal imagery is difficult to maintain, however, due to variations in sensor characteristics, atmospheric conditions, solar angle, and sensor view angle that can obscure surface change detection. To detect accurate landscape change using multitemporal images, we developed a variation of the pseudoinvariant feature (PIF) normalization scheme: the temporally invariant cluster (TIC) method. Image data were acquired on June 9, 1990 (Landsat 4), June 20, 2000 (Landsat 7), and August 26, 2001 (Landsat 7) to analyze boreal forests near the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and reduced simple ratio (RSR). The temporally invariant cluster (TIC) centers were identified via a point density map of collocated pixel VIs from the base image and the target image, and a normalization regression line was created to intersect all TIC centers. Target image VI values were then recalculated using the regression function so that these two images could be compared using the resulting common radiometric scale. We found that EVI was very indicative of vegetation structure because of its sensitivity to shadowing effects and could thus be used to separate conifer forests from deciduous forests and grass/crop lands. Conversely, because NDVI reduced the radiometric influence of shadow, it did not allow for distinctions among these vegetation types. After normalization, correlations of NDVI and EVI with forest leaf area index (LAI) field measurements combined for 2000 and 2001 were significantly improved; the r(2) values in these regressions rose from 0.49 to 0.69 and from 0.46 to 0.61, respectively. An EVI "cancellation effect" where EVI was positively related to understory greenness but negatively related to forest canopy coverage was evident across a post fire chrono sequence with normalized data. These findings indicate that the TIC method provides a simple, effective and repeatable method to create radiometrically comparable data sets for remote detection of landscape change. Compared to some previous relative radiometric normalization methods, this new method does not require high level programming and statistical skills, yet remains sensitive to landscape changes occurring over seasonal and inter-annual time scales. In addition, the TIC method maintains sensitivity to subtle changes in vegetation phenology and enables normalization even when invariant features are rare. While this normalization method allowed detection of a range of land use, land cover, and phenological/biophysical changes in the Siberian boreal forest region studied here, it is necessary to further examine images representing a wide variety of ecoregions to thoroughly evaluate the TIC method against other normalization schemes.

AB State-of-the-art passive microwave remote sensing-based snow water equivalent (SWE) algorithms correct for factors believed to most significantly affect retrieved SWE bias and uncertainty. For example, a recently developed semi-empirical SWE retrieval algorithm accounts for systematic and random error caused by forest cover and snow morphology (crystal size - a function of location and time of year). However, we have found that climate and land surface complexities lead to significant systematic and random error uncertainties in remotely sensed SWE retrievals that are not included in current SWE estimation algorithms. Joint analysis of independent meteorological records, ground SWE measurements, remotely sensed SWE estimates, and land surface characteristics have provided a unique look at the error structure of these recently developed satellite SWE products. We considered satellite-derived SWE errors associated with the snow pack mass itself, the distance to significant open water bodies, liquid water in the snow pack and/or morphology change due to melt and refreeze, forest cover, snow class, and topographic factors such as large scale root mean square roughness and dominant aspect. Analysis of the nine-year Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) SWE data set was undertaken for Canada where many in-situ measurements are available. It was found that for SMMR pixels with 5 or more ground stations available, the remote sensing product was generally unbiased with a seasonal maximum 20 mm average root mean square error for SWE values less than 100 mm. For snow packs above 100 mm, the SWE estimate bias was linearly related to the snow pack mass and the root mean square error increased to around 150 mm. Both the distance to open water and average monthly mean air temperature were found to significantly influence the retrieved SWE product uncertainty. Apart from maritime snow class, which had the greatest snow class affect on root mean square error and bias, all other factors showed little relation to observed uncertainties. Eliminating the drop-in-the-bucket averaged gridded remote sensing SWE data within 200 km of open water bodies, for monthly mean temperatures greater than -2 degrees C, and for snow packs greater than 100 mm, has resulted in a remotely sensed SWE product that is useful for practical applications.

AB Tracking the presence, distribution and disappearance of biological soil crusts is important for ecosystem management of desert regions and provides highly valuable information on desertification and climate change studies in and environments. Based on the analysis of the spectral features of biological soil crusts, we propose a new biological soil crust index (BSCI) for biological soil crusts mapping. Using both a radiative transfer simulation and an analysis of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image, we examined the ability of satellite remote sensing to detect and map biological soil crusts. Our simulation indicated that Landsat ETM+ data could be used, after atmospheric correction, to detect biological soil crusts if 33% or more of any pixel was accounted for by biological soil crusts. When the proposed BSCI was applied to the detection of biological soil crusts in the Gurbantonggut Desert, Xingjiang, China, a Kappa coefficient of 0.82 and an overall accuracy of 94.7% were achieved. These experimental results indicate that the new index is applicable to identification of lichen-dominated biological soil crusts, and therefore has good potential for biological soil crust detection and mapping in cool and cold deserts.

AB Quantification of spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall is an important step toward developing regional hydrological models. However, traditionally used rain gauge data are sparse and do not always provide adequate spatial representation of rainfall. In this study, we evaluated the daily I-degree resolution remotely-sensed atmospheric precipitation data provided by Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) as an alternative to rain gauge-measured data. We analyzed data from the watersheds of southern California during the period of 1996-2003, focusing on the comparison of patterns of spatial, seasonal, and interannual rainfall dynamics, We used Empirical Orthogonal Functions to discern the patterns of precipitation and atmospheric circulation at different time scales, from synoptic to interannual. The correlation between the daily rain gauge-measured and remotely-sensed precipitation wits poor and the resulting patterns of remotely-sensed precipitation are different than the temporal patterns of precipitation accumulated by rain gauges. These differences likely result from the fact that the precipitable water concentration measured by satellites is not always highly correlated to rainfall reaching the earth surface. Differences in the spatial resolution and coverage of the two methods and the differential influence of orographic effects and wind patterns on each also contribute to low correlations, We conclude that daily remotely-sensed precipitation produced at GPCP is not currently appropriate for use in assessing fine-scale hydrological processes in arid zones like southern California, and would not be a recommended surrogate for event-based hydrologic modeling. At the same time, the interannual variabilities of remotely-sensed and gauge-measured precipitation were highly correlated and the regional patterns of gauge-measured and remotely-sensed precipitation variability were similar; though the total precipitation estimated from satellite data was substantially lower than the gauge-measured data. Therefore, remotely-sensed precipitation data may be appropriate for use in long-term regional hydrologic or climate modeling focused on trends and patterns of rainfall in southern California. Both data sets showed that precipitation generally decreases from the northern to the southern watersheds. At interannual time-scale, the rainfall is related to the ENSO cycle. At synoptic time-scales, the rainfall patterns in southern California result from atmospheric moisture transport from the south-southwest. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The input roughness parameters for electromagnetic backscattering modelling need to be accurate to estimate radar measurements correctly over bare soils, particularly in agricultural environments. This paper proposes to evaluate the roughness description in terms of several characterisations through a correlation function using a numerical backscattering model. The experimental database used in this study is based on ASAR-ENVISAT experimental campaigns in the Beauce region (France).
   Two presentations of the surface height correlation function are proposed in this study. The first one, referred to as the "alpha function" fits the experimental correlation functions up to the correlation length, while the second one, the "(a,b) function", fits the correlation function for scales corresponding to positive values. A relationship is proposed between the rms height of soil surface and the shape of the correlation function. Using the a function, comparisons between radar measurements for high incidence angles and simulations based on the numerical backscattering model (moment method) show a good agreement for soil surfaces with an rms height smaller than 2 cm with medium and high soil moisture.

AB An understanding of land use/land cover change at local, regional, and global scales is important in an increasingly human-dominated biosphere. Here, we report on an under-appreciated complexity in the analysis of land cover change important in and and semi-arid environments. In these environments, some land cover types show a high degree of inter-annual variability in productivity. In this study, we show that ecosystems dominated by non-native cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) show an inter-annual amplified response to rainfall distinct from native shrub/bunch grass in the Great Basin, US. This response is apparent in time series of Landsat and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) that encompass enough time to include years with high and low rainfall. Based oil areas showing a similar amplified response elsewhere in the Great Basin, 20,000 km 2, or 7% of land cover, are currently dominated by cheatgrass. Inter-annual patterns, like the high variability seen in cheatgrass-dominated areas, should be considered for more accurate land cover classification. Land cover change science should be aware that high inter-annual variability is inherent in annual dominated ecosystems and does not necessarily correspond to active land cover change.

AB The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiorneter (MISR) instrument on the Terra satellite has demonstrated the capability to retrieve aerosol optical depths, surface bidirectional reflectance factors, and hemispherical reflectances over a wide variety of land surface types. In particular. its multiangular imaging design has enabled the application of algorithms that minimize sensitivity of the aerosol retrievals to the brightness of the underlying surface. The novel aerosol algorithm that was developed prior to launch has had notable quantitative success. Over certain scene types, however, the approach contained obvious spatial artifacts, so a postlaunch refinement to the algorithm was implemented. It constrains the retrieved aerosol models and optical depths such that the implied angular shape of the surface hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF) is similar among all of the MISR wavelengths. This upgrade has resulted in three tangible benefits: (1) the 1 occurrence of outliers has been dramatilcally reduced, (2) correlations with AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) aerosol sunphotometer data are quantitatively improved, and (3) the quality of surface products is markedly enhanced. MISR Level 2 aerosol and surface products are archived at the NASA Langley Atmospheric Sciences Data Center. Those having version numbers v0012 and higher incorporate ibis upgrade in the data processing software. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instruments on the Terra spacecraft provide accurate shortwave (SW), longwave (LW) and window (WN) region top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance measurements from which TOA radiative flux values are obtained by applying Angular Distribution Models (ADMs). These models are developed empirically as functions of the surface and cloud properties provided by coincident high-resolution imager measurements over CERES field-of-view. However, approximately 5.6% of the CERES/Terra footprints lack sufficient imager information for a reliable scene identification. To avoid any systematic biases in regional mean radiative fluxes, it is important to provide TOA fluxes for these footprints. For this put-pose, we apply a feedforward error-backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique to reproduce CERES/Terra ADMs relying only on CERES measurements. All-sky ANN-based angular distribution models are developed for 10 surface types separately for shortwave, longwave and window TOA flux retrievals. To optimize the ANN performance, we use a partially connected first hidden neuron layer and compact training sets with reduced data noise. We demonstrate the performance of the ANN-based ADMs by comparing TOA fluxes inferred from ANN and CERES anisotropic factors. The global annual average bias in ANN-derived fluxes relative to CERES is less than 0.5% for all ANN scene types. The maximum bias occurs over sea ice and permanent snow surfaces. For all surface types, instantaneous ANN-derived TOA fluxes are self-consistent in viewing zenith angle to within 9% for shortwave, 3.5% and 3% longwave daytime and nighttime, respectively.

AB To investigate scattering of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals from terrain and the potential for remotely sensing soil moisture with the L-band GPS bistatic radar concept, a prototype GPS bistatic radar participated in airborne measurements during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02). A 12-channel GPS navigation receiver, modified to perform bistatic radar measurements, was mounted on the NCAR C- 130 aircraft to make co-located measurements with other instruments. Narrow pulse returns and comparison of the reflected GPS signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) measurements to digital imagery and cover maps indicated that the scattering was most likely quasi-specular, originating from a small footprint on the order of the first Fresnel zone (similar to 30 in). Temporal changes were observed in the measured signals and were expected to be proportional to varying soil moisture content. To investigate this effect, the bistatic signal measurements were interpolated to a spatial grid to produce daily maps of relative change of surface soil moisture over the study region. The maps of the study region showed a transition from dry surface soil moisture conditions to wet conditions following precipitation events occurring in the middle of the study period. Additionally, the maps showed the scattered power increased in areas with localized rainfall relative to areas without precipitation. Comparing the GPS-reflected SNR measurements with L-band brightness temperatures measured coincidently by the PALS radiometer showed good agreement in the trend measured by the two sensors. The scattered signal measurements were also compared with in situ soil moisture measurements and found to follow the general soil moisture trend as a function of time. These initial results from the first controlled experiment of GPS bistatic radar for soil moisture remote sensing indicate that the technique is sensitive to temporal and spatial variations in soil moisture.

AB Methods have been investigated which use fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image data to measure ocean slopes and wave spectra. Independent techniques have been developed to measure wave slopes in the SAR azimuth and range directions. The azimuth slope technique, in particular, is a more direct measurement than conventional, intensity based, backscatter cross-section measurements.
   In the azimuth direction, wave-induced perturbations of the polarimetric orientation angle are used to sense the wave slopes. In the range direction, a new technique involving the alpha parameter from the Cloude-Pottier H-A-(alpha) over bar- (Entropy, Anisotropy, and (averaged) Alpha) polarimetric scattering decomposition theorem is used to measure slopes. Both measurement types are sensitive to ocean wave slopes and are directional. Taken together, they form a means of using polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) image data to make complete measurements of either ocean wave slopes, or directional wave spectra.
   These measurements must still contend with fundamental nonlinearities in the SAR image processing (i.e., azimuth direction "velocity bunching") that are due to wave velocity and acceleration effects.
   NASA/JPL/AIRSAR L-, and P-band data from California coastal waters were used in the studies. Wave parameters measured using the new methods are compared with those developed using both conventional SAR intensity based methods, and with in situ NOAA National Data Center buoy measurement products.

AB In this paper, three methods to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) from thermal infrared data supplied by band 6 of the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor onboard the Landsat 5 satellite are compared. The first of them lies on the estimation of the land surface temperature from the radiative transfer equation using in situ radiosounding data. The others two are the mono-window algorithm developed by Qin et al. [International Journal of Remote Sensing 22 (2001) 3719] and the single-channel algorithm developed by Jimenez-Munoz and Sobrino [Journal. of Geophysical Research 108 (2003)]. The land surface emissivity (LSE) values needed in order to apply these methods have been estimated from a methodology that uses the visible and near infrared bands. Finally, we present a comparison between the LST measured in situ and the retrieved by the algorithms over an agricultural region of Spain (La Plana de Requena-Utiel). The results show a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.009 for emissivity and lower than 1 K for land surface temperature when the Jimenez-Munoz algorithm is used. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB We evaluated whether satellite radar remote sensing of landscape seasonal freeze-thaw cycles provides an effective measure of active growing season timing and duration for boreal and subalpine evergreen forests. Landscape daily radar backscatter measurements from the SeaWinds scatterometer on-board the QuikSCAT satellite were evaluated across a regional network of North American coniferous forest sites for 2000 and 2001. Radar remote sensing measurements of the initiation and length of the growing season corresponded closely with both site measurements and ecosystem process model (BIOME-BGC) simulations of these parameters because of the sensitivity of the K.-band scatterometer to snow cover freeze-thaw dynamics and associated linkages between growing season initiation and the timing of seasonal snowmelt. In contrast, remote sensing estimates of the timing of growing season termination were either weakly or not significantly associated with site measurements and model simulation results, due to the relative importance of light availability and other environmental controls on stand phenology in the fall. Regional patterns of estimated annual net primary production (NPP) and component photosynthetic and autotrophic respiration rates for the evergreen forest sites also corresponded favorably with remote sensing estimates of the seasonal timing of spring thaw and associated growing season length, indicating the importance of these parameters in determining spatial and temporal patterns of NPP and the potential utility of satellite radar remote sensing for regional monitoring of the terrestrial biosphere.

AB The goal of this research was to compare narrowband hyperspectral Hyperion data with broadband hyperspatial IKONOS data and advanced multispectral Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data through modeling and classifying complex rainforest vegetation. For this purpose, Hyperion, ALI, IKONOS, and ETM+ data were acquired for southern Cameroon, a region considered to be a representative area for tropical moist evergreen and semi-deciduous forests. Field data, collected in near-real time to coincide with satellite sensor overpass, were used to (1) quantify and model the biomass of tree, shrub, and weed species; and (2) characterize forest land use/land cover (LULC) classes.
   The study established that even the most advanced broadband sensors (i.e., ETM+, IKONOS, and ALI) bad serious limitations in modeling biomass and in classifying forest LULC classes. The broadband models explained only 13-60% of the variability in biomass across primary forests, secondary forests, and fallows. The overall accuracies were between 42% and 51% for classifying nine complex rainforest LULC classes using the broadband data of these sensors. Within individual vegetation types (e.g., primary or secondary forest), the overall accuracies increased slightly, but followed a similar trend. Among the broadband sensors, ALI sensor performed better than the IKONOS and ETM+ sensors.
   When compared to the three broadband sensors, Hyperion narrowband data produced (1) models that explained 36-83% more of the variability in rainforest biomass, and (2) LULC classifications with 45-52% higher overall accuracies. Twenty-three Hyperion narrowbands that were most sensitive in modeling forest biomass and in classifying forest LULC classes were identified and discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sugar maple (Acer Saccharunt Marsh.) damage resulting from a severe ice storm was modeled and mapped over eastern Ontario using pre- and post-storm Landsat 5 imagery and environmental data. Visual damage estimates in 104 plots and corresponding reflectance and environmental data were divided into multiple, mutually exclusive training and reference datasets for damage classification evaluation. Damage classification accuracy was compared among four methods: multiple regression, linear discriminant analysis, maximum likelihood, and neural networks. Using the best classifier, various stratification methods were assessed for potential inflationary effects on classification accuracy due to spatial proximity between training and reference data. Of the classifiers that were evaluated, neural networks performed best. Neural networks 'learn' training data accurately (94% overall), but classify proximate reference data less accurately (65%), and distant, spatially independent reference data least accurately (55%). Results indicate that, while remotely sensed and environmental data cannot discriminate among many levels of deciduous ice storm damage, they can by considered useful for differentiating areas of low to medium damage from areas of severe damage (69% accuracy). Such classification methods can provide regional damage maps more objectively than point-based visual estimates or aerial sketch mapping and aid in identification of areas of severe damage where management intervention may be advantageous.

AB With the advances in computing and imaging technology, the field of precision agriculture is rapidly becoming a practical means for farm management. An important step in the delivery of highly accurate images for farm managers is the within-image correction for viewing geometry effects. Reflected light on an imaging sensor is influenced by properties of view zenith angle, solar zenith angle, and relative azimuth. There are a number of models that describe this effect termed the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) or more generically "viewing geometry effects." In this paper, we compared three BRDF models (Roujean, Shibayama-Wiegand, and Dymond-Qi) with a fuzzy inference system (FIS) for three data sets for correction of geometric effects. One data set consisted of ground data collected at different viewing angles of a cotton crop. Another data set included six aircraft images of a corn plot in a different part of each image. The final data set was an aerial image of a planting density experiment of cotton. All the models performed reasonably well, but the FIS was the most consistent predictor of BRDF for all three data sets. For the ground data set, R-2 statistics for predicting the reflectance based on the trained models ranged from 0.53 to 0.93 for the BRDF models and from 0.94 to 0.97 for the FIS.

ID KYUNGGI PROVINCE; LARVAL HABITATS; VILLAGES
AB Malaria reemerged in the Republic of Korea (ROK) in 1993. While limited numbers of U.S. soldiers in high-risk areas use chloroquine/primaquine chemoprophylaxis to prevent malaria, control of mosquito larvae through larviciding also can be used to reduce the risk of malaria transmission. In order to estimate the cost of larviciding, accurate estimates of the spatial extent of mosquito larval habitats are necessary. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an accurate estimate of the area covered by mosquito larval habitats can be obtained using Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+) and/or IKONOS data for the Korean test site.
   To estimate the area covered by larval habitats near Camp Greaves [Paekyeon-Ri, near Tongil-Chon (village)] in the ROK, an IKONOS and a Landsat 7 ETM+ image were classified using a parallelepiped classification. In a comparison with rice paddy field sites, 24 (92%) of the sites were classified correctly on the IKONOS image and 17 (65%) were classified correctly on the Landsat image. Comparing the classifications on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the agreement between the two classifications was 79%. Part of the disagreement was due to the difference in resolution of the two images. In spite of local differences, the two classifications produced similar area estimates.
   Although either Landsat or IKONOS could be used in Korea for a reasonable estimate of habitat area, only IKONOS can resolve small irrigation ponds. While ponds represent a small portion of the total larval habitat, they are an important source for mosquito breeding during the late rice-growing season in the ROK since they contain higher larval densities. High-resolution imagery, such as IKONOS, would be necessary for planning and implementing treatment of these smaller habitats. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Many research projects require accurate delineation of different secondary succession (SS) stages over large regions/subregions of the Amazon basin. However, the complexity of vegetation stand structure, abundant vegetation species, and the smooth transition between different SS stages make vegetation classification difficult when using traditional approaches such as the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Most of the time, classification distinguishes only between forest/non-forest. It has been difficult to accurately distinguish stages of SS. In this paper, a linear mixture model (LMM) approach is applied to classify successional and mature forests using Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery in the Rondonia region of the Brazilian Amazon. Three endmembers (i.e., shade, soil, and green vegetation or GV) were identified based on the image itself and a constrained least-squares solution was used to unmix the image. This study indicates that the LMM approach is a promising method for distinguishing successional and mature forests in the Amazon basin using TM data. It improved vegetation classification accuracy over that of the MLC. Initial, intermediate, and advanced successional and mature forests were classified with overall accuracy of 78.2% using a threshold method on the ratio of shade to GV fractions, a 7.4% increase over the MLC. The GV and shade fractions are sensitive to the change of vegetation stand structures and better capture biophysical structure information. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A multitemporal sequence of ERS interferometric coherence data acquired between 1993 and 1999 are utilised for automatically mapping urban change within South Wales, UK. Validation of the change map derived from the coherence data is performed using independent, multidate, digital survey data of the city of Cardiff, UK. All major building developments that have occurred within the study area are located. There is evidence to suggest that this approach is generalisable for a wide range of coherence data and to other regions with similar landscapes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The accuracy of the 1992 National Land-Cover Data (NLCD) map is assessed via a probability sampling design incorporating three levels of stratification and two stages of selection. Agreement between the map and reference land-cover labels is defined as a match between the primary or alternate reference label determined for a sample pixel and a mode class of the mapped 3 x 3 block of pixels centered on the sample pixel. Results are reported for each of the four regions comprising the eastern United States for both Anderson Level I and II classifications. Overall accuracies for Levels I and II are 80% and 46% for New England, 82% and 62% for New York/New Jersey (NY/NJ), 70% and 43% for the Mid-Atlantic, and 83% and 66% for the Southeast.

AB A strong linear relationship is found between Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) microwave (19 and 37 GHz) surface emissivities at horizontal and vertical polarizations over snow- and ice-free land surfaces. This allows retrieving the land surface emissivity and temperature from satellite microwave brightness temperatures after atmospheric corrections. Over the Canadian sub-arctic continental area, we show that the main factor modifying the emissivity is the fraction of water surface (FWS) within a pixel. Accordingly, a map of the fraction of water surface across the Canadian landmass is derived, given a correspondence within 6% as compared to the I km 2 Canadian National Topographic Database of water-covered areas. The microwave-derived surface temperatures are compared to synchronous in situ air and ground surface temperatures and also with independent satellite IR measurements over areas without snow or ice. Root mean square differences range between 2degrees and 3.5degrees, with mean bias error of the order of 1-3degrees. Better results are always obtained with the 37 GHz channel rather than with the 19 GHz channel. Over dense vegetation, the microwave-derived surface temperature is closer to the air temperature (at surface level) than to the ground temperature. The proposed simple retrieval algorithm, not sensitive to cloud cover, appears very useful for monitoring summer interannual or seasonal trends of the fraction of surface water, as well as the daily land surface temperature variation, which are very important parameters in environmental change analysis.

AB The radioactive contamination from the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (CNPP) caused significant change in the abundance and distribution of tree species in the exclusion zone. Some 400 ha of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) were killed from high levels of contamination and these areas have since been recolonised by silver birch (Betula pendula). Much work has shown that changes in leaf pigments (chlorophyll a and b, carotenoids) and biomass as a result of water and nutrient deficiencies and other environmental influences can be detected through spectral reflectance characteristics of leaves. This paper presents the results of a reconnaissance study showing that spectral reflectance measurements can also be used to detect the effect of radionuclide contamination on the vegetation in the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Through laboratory and in situ spectroradiometry of silver birch and Scots pine, we demonstrate that the chlorophyll red edge and the Three Channel Vegetation Index (TCHVI) correlate well with specific activities of Sr-90 and Cs-137 in leaves, gamma-dose rates and Cs-137 inventories in soil. The results show that remote sensing has the potential of providing a valuable monitoring technique for assessing the ecological impact of radionuclide contamination. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Until recently, advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) observations were the only viable source of data for global land cover mapping. While many useful insights have been gained from analyses based on AVHRR data, the availability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with greatly improved spectral, spatial, geometric, and radiometric attributes provides significant new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing-based land cover mapping research. In this paper, we describe the algorithms and databases being used to produce the MODIS global land cover product. This product provides maps of global land cover at 1-km spatial resolution using several classification systems, principally that of the IGBP. To generate these maps, a supervised classification methodology is used that exploits a global database of training sites interpreted from high-resolution imagery in association with ancillary data. In addition to the IGBP class at each pixel, the MODIS land cover product provides several other parameters including estimates for the classification confidence associated with the IGBP label, a prediction for the most likely alternative class, and class labels for several other classification schemes that are used by the global modeling community. Initial results based on 5 months of MODIS data are encouraging. At global scales, the distribution of vegetation and land cover types is qualitatively realistic. At regional scales, comparisons among heritage AVHRR products, Landsat TM data, and results from MODIS show that the algorithm is performing well. As a longer time series of data is added to the processing stream and the representation of global land cover in the site database is refined, the quality of the MODIS land cover product will improve accordingly.

AB The MODIS instrument provides major advances in moderate resolution earth observation. Improved spatial resolution for land observation at 250 and 500 m and improved spectral band placement provide new remote sensing opportunities. NASA has invested in the development of improved algorithms for MODIS, which will provide new data sets for global change research. Surface reflectance is one of the key products from MODIS and is used in developing several higher-order land products. The surface reflectance algorithm builds on the heritage of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and SeaWiFS algorithms, taking advantage of the new sensing capabilities of MODIS. Atmospheric correction by the removal of water vapor and aerosol effects provides improvements over previous coarse resolution products and the basis for a new time-series, which will extend through to the NPOESS generation imagers. This paper summarizes the first evaluation of the MODIS surface reflectance product accuracy, in comparison with other data products and in the context of the MODIS instrument performance since launch. The MODIS surface reflectance product will provide an important time-series data set for quantifying global environmental change. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The major aim of this paper is the validation of SeaWiFS-derived chlorophyll-a concentration in the Mediterranean Sea. A data set containing in situ chlorophyll-a profiles and optical measurements of in-water and above-water radiances was used to evaluate the performances of several ocean color algorithms in the Mediterranean Sea. The analysis revealed a systematic overestimation of chlorophyll-a concentration by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) global algorithms (OC2v4 and OC4v4). The error appears to be correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration. by exhibiting marked differences at low values (C<0.15 mg/m(3)). In particular at low concentration, the bias observed for OC2v4 is about twice that observed for OC4v4. The same analysis made using the Gitelson et al. [J. Mar. Syst. 9 (1996) 283.] Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS) regional algorithm (GIT) revealed that this model underestimates the pigments concentration but it does not exhibit a correlation between the error and the measures. On the other hand, when the NASA standard algorithms are applied to remotely sensed data, the behavior appears reversed: the OC2v4 algorithm exhibits better estimates than OC4v4, which is probably more affected by atmospheric correction problems. When applied to satellite data, the GIT algorithm performs better than the NASA global algorithms, although the estimates are very poor in the high chlorophyll-a range. Two new Mediterranean algorithms are then proposed by fitting our Mediterranean bio-optical data set with linear and OC2-like functional forms. The new algorithms perform well when applied either to the bio-optical measurements or to satellite data. The different behavior of the same algorithm when applied to bio-optical measurements or to remotely sensed data demonstrates that the atmospheric correction is still the main source of error in ocean color data. Due to the relatively small number of available in situ data, the algorithms that we generated have to be considered very preliminary. Discussion was carried out on the reasons of the global algorithm misfit, providing possible explanations and some preliminary result. The influence of coccolithophores and of the yellow substance on the optical response of the Mediterranean waters is investigated, showing that they can at least partially explain the systematic misfit. All the above shows that a region like the Mediterranean Sea requires an independent treatment of the atmospheric and of the in-water bio-optical term to obtain reliable estimates of phytoplankton activity.

AB Remote sensing needs to clarify, the strengths of different methods so they can be consistently applied in forest management and ecology. Both the use of phenological information in satellite imagery and the use of vegetation indices have independently improved classifications of north temperate forests. Combining these sources of information in change detection has been effective for land cover classifications at the continental scale based on Advanced 'Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery. Our objective is to test if using vegetation indices and change analysis of multiseasonal imagery can also improve the classification accuracy of deciduous forests at the landscape scale. We used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes that corresponded to Populus spp. leaf-on and Quercus spp, leaf-off (May), peak summer (August), Acer spp. peak color (September),Acer spp. and Populus spp. leaf-off (October). Input data files derived from the imagery were: (1) TM Bands 3, 4, and 5 from all dates; (2) Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) from all dates; (3) Tasseled Cap brightness, greenness, and wetness (BGB) from all dates; (4) difference in TM Bands 3, 4, and 5 from one date to the next; (5) difference in NDVI from one date to the next; and (6) difference in BGW from one date to the next. The overall kappa statistics (KHAT) for the aforementioned classifications of deciduous genera were 0.48, 0.36, 0.33, 0.38, 0.26, 0.43, respectively. The highest accuracies occurred from TNI Bands 3, 4, and 5 (61.0% for deciduous genera, 67.8% for all classes) or from the difference in BGW (61.0% for deciduous genera, 67.8% for all classes). However, the difference in Tasseled Cap classification more accurately separated deciduous shrubs and harvested stands from closed canopy forest. Our results indicate that phenological change of forest is most accurately captured by combining image differencing and Tasseled Cap indices. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Surface solar irradiance (I-SFC) can be inferred from satellite-observed radiance with retrieval algorithms based on the independent pixel approximation (IPA). As the spatial resolution of satellite sensors increases, the effects from spatially inhomogeneous cloud fields become more important. Clouds affect the distribution of radiation in a region larger than the resolution of an individual pixel and IPA is no longer justified. The objective of this study is to identify effects of clouds and find corrections for IPA to compensate for these effects. For this Purpose. cloud fields are generated with the mesoscale model MM5 at high resolution. A shallow and a convective cloud field are then used as input for a 3-D Monte Carlo radiation model that computes the radiance distribution at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface. Surface irradiance is computed from the upwelling radiance with a method that simulates IPA retrieval. The retrieved irradiance is compared against the one computed with the 3-D model. Two effects of clouds are related to the solar and viewing geometry. noted as a shift of the apparent position of clouds and their shadows. Another cloud effect is the diffusion of radiation: Scattering removes part of the radiation from an atmospheric column and distributes it to neighboring columns. Corrections for these effects are suggested, which can improve the IPA-based retrieval of I-SFC. All corrections depend upon the cloud altitude. which may be difficult to obtain in operational applications. A sensitivity analysis suggests that a coarse estimate of the cloud top altitude is sufficient for the corrections. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The production of thematic maps, such as those depicting land cover, using an image classification is one of the most common applications of remote sensing. Considerable research has been directed at the various components of the mapping process, including the assessment of accuracy. This paper briefly reviews the background and methods of classification accuracy assessment that are commonly used and recommended in the research literature. It is, however, evident that the research community does not universally adopt the approaches that are often recommended to it, perhaps a reflection of the problems associated with accuracy assessment, and typically fails to achieve the accuracy targets commonly specified. The community often tends to use, unquestioningly, techniques based on the confusion matrix for which the correct application and interpretation requires the satisfaction of often untenable assumptions (e.g., perfect coregistration of data sets) and the provision of rarely conveyed information (e.g., sampling design for ground data acquisition). Eight broad problem areas that currently limit the ability to appropriately assess, document, and use the accuracy of thematic maps derived from remote sensing are explored. The implications of these problems are that it is unlikely that a single standardized method of accuracy assessment and reporting can be identified, but some possible directions for future research that may facilitate accuracy assessment are highlighted.

ID SURFACE TEMPERATURE; ALGORITHM; EOS-AM1
AB The present article is a study of the channel-dependent noise and systematic error in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal infrared (TIR) data in bands 20-25 and 27-36 using early MODIS data over lake and ocean sites in clear-sky days acquired with the A-side of scan mirror and electronics before the end of October 2000. In 14 cases of subarea sites with a size of 10 lines by 16 pixels each line, where the brightness temperature in band 31 changes within +/-0.1 K, average and standard deviation values of brightness temperatures in 10 channels (consisting a 10-element linear detector array) of 16 MODIS TIR bands show the channel-dependent noise and systematic errors. A method is presented to separate the channel-dependent systematic error from noise due to variations in surface and atmospheric conditions. This case study shows that in the total 160 MODIS TIR channels, three channels are too noisy to use, 10 channels have significant channel-dependent noise. and all other channels met the specification of noise equivalent temperature difference (NEDT). After correcting the channel-dependent systematic errors. the quality of the MODIS TIR data is significantly improved in bands 22-25 and 27-30. More uniform sites in the brightness temperatures of bands 33-36 are needed to accurately estimate the values of channel-dependent systematic errors because the effects of spatial variations in atmospheric conditions are often larger in these four bands.

AB Fragmentation of critical early winter caribou habitat in the North Columbia Mountains near Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Parks in British Columbia, Canada. may be occurring as a result of timber harvesting and wildfires. In this research, habitat suitability models derived from Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) imagery for 1975 and Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery for 1997 were developed to represent the landscape for the study area in a past (1975) and more recent condition (1997). A Hybrid Decision Tree (HDT) Classifier was used to combine maximum likelihood decision rules, a brightness differencing technique, and a spatial/contextual rule base. Verified by field samples and aerial photographs, the accuracy of the resulting habitat unit maps was determined to be 91.8% overall in the 1997 TM classification and 89.5% overall in the 1975 MSS classification. Based on a comparative analysis of selected spatial landscape metrics calculated for each time period, changes in the composition and spatial configuration of early winter habitat were quantified. Overall, the amount of suitable winter habitat available in 1997 represented a decrease of approximately 832.88 ha (8.53%) from 1975 levels. In the observed disturbance pattern, early winter habitat patches in 1997 were smaller and more uniform in size than in 1975. as suggested by decreases in mean patch size and patch size coefficient of variation indices. Spatial pattern analysis results indicated a reduction in geometric complexity, interior core area, and mean proximity between 1975 and 1997, while patch density and edge density had increased over time. The interpretation of changes in landscape structure are consistent with those reported in the literature for other regions, and indicate that fragmentation of early winter caribou habitat has occurred in the study area.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; TREES
AB Operational monitoring of land cover from satellite data will require automated procedures for analyzing large volumes of data. We propose multiple criteria for assessing algorithms for this task. In addition to standard classification accuracy measures, we propose criteria to account for computational resources requires by the algorithms, stability of the algorithms, and robustness to noise in the training data. We also propose that classification accuracy take account, through estimation of misclassification costs, of unequal consequences to the user depending on which cover types are confused. In this article, we apply these criteria to three variants of decision tree classifiers, a standard decision tree implemented in C5.0 and two techniques recently proposed in the machine learning literature known as "bagging" and "boosting." Each of these algorithms are applied to two data sets, a global land cover classification from 8 km AVHRR data and a Landsat Thematic Mapper scene in Peru. Results indicate comparable accuracy of the three variants of the decision tree algorithms on the two data sets, with boosting providing marginally higher accuracies. The bagging and boosting algorithms, however, are both substantially more stable and more robust to noise in the training data compared with the standard C5.0 decision tree. The bagging algorithm is most costly in terms of computational resources while the standard decision tree is least costly. The results illustrate that the choice of the most suitable algorithm requires consideration of a suite of criteria in additions to the traditional accuracy measures and that there are likely to be trade-offs between algorithm performance and required computational resources.

AB Field measurement of shrubland ecological properties is important for both site monitoring and validation of remote sensing information. During the May 1997 NASA Earth Observing System Jornada Prototype Validation Exercise, we calculated plot-level plant area index leaf area index, total fractional cover, and green fractional cover with data from four instruments: (1) a Dycam Agricultural Digital Camera (ADC), (2) a LI-COR LAI-2000 plant canopy analyser, (3) a Decagon sunfleck Ceptometer, and (4) a laser altimeter. Estimates from the LAI-2000 and Ceptometer were very similar (plant area index 0.3, leaf area index 0.22, total fractional cover 0.19, green fractional cover 0.14), while the ADC produced values 5% to 10% higher. Laser altimeter values, depending on the height cutoff used to establish total fractional cover were either higher or lower than the other instruments' values: a 10-cm cutoff produced values similar to 80% higher, while a 20-cm cutoff produced values similar to 30% lower The LAI-2000 and Ceptometer are designed to operate in hamogenons canopies, not the sparse and irregular vegetation found at Jornada. Thus, these instruments were primarily useful for relative within-site plant area index monitoring. Calculation of some parameters required destructive sampling, a relatively slow and labor-intensive activity that limits spatial and temporal applicability. Validation/monitoring campaigns therefore should be guided by consideration of the amount of time and resources required to obtain measurements of the desired variables. Our results suggest that the ADC is both efficient and accurate for long-term or large-scale monitoring of arid ecosystems. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Sampling inference is the process of generalizing from sample data to make statements or draw conclusions about a population. Design-based inference is the inferential framework commonly invoked when sampling techniques are used in thematic map accuracy assessment. The conceptual basis of design-based inference is described, followed by discussion of practical implications of design-based inference, including (1) the population to which the inferences apply, (2) estimation formulas and their justification, (3) interpretation of accuracy measures, (4) representation of variability, (5) effect of spatial correlation, and (6) role of probability sampling. Design-based inference is contrasted with model-based inference, another inferential framework frequently invoked in statistics. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

ID BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTANCE; LEAF CANOPIES; SURFACE; RADIATION
AB This article presents a new formula for the joint transmission in homogeneous leaf canopies which relies on the existing definition of the conditional probability for events that there exist gaps in the incidence and emergence lives. Rather than applying a hot spot correction term to the independent events, the mean probability between the independent and the dependent events is estimated. The problem is solved graphically by analogy with the physical processes of light extinction by finite objects. Then a parametric hot spot model is derived which performs rather well when compared with airborne hot spot measurements over a conifer forest target and shows that the hot spot phenomenon is only a feature of the observed directional signature in the backscattering region. The findings suggest the requirement of a hot spot kernel in a host bidirectional reflectance model. Bearing in mind its simplicity, the hot spot model of this study is clearly not designed for inversion but will serve to improve albedo calculation from multiangular measurements from the new generation of remote sensing sensor system.

AB In this study, the 16-day MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) vegetation index (VI) compositing algorithm and product were described evaluated, and compared with the current AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Spectroradiometer) maximum value composite (MVC) approach. The MVC method selects the highest NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) oner a certain time interval. The MODIS Til compositing algorithm emphasizes a global and operational view angle standardization approach: a reflectance-based BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) model, succeeded by a back-up MV algorithm that includes a view angle constraint. A year's worth of daily global AVHRR data tons used to prototype the MODIS vegetation index compositing algorithm. The composite scenarios were evaluated with respect to: 1) temporal evolution of the VI for different continents and vegetation types, 2) spatial continuity of the VI, 3) quality flags related to data integrity, cloud cover, and composite method and 4) view angle distribution of the composited data. On a continental scale, the composited NDVI values from the MODIS algorithm were as much as 30% lower than the mostly, off-nadir NDVI results based on the MVC criterion. The temporal evolution of the NDVI values derived with the MODIS algorithm were similar to the NDVI values derived from the MVC algorithm. A simple BRDF model was adequate to produce nadir equivalent reflectance values from which the NDVI could be computed. Application of the BRDF and "back-up" components in the MODIS algorithm were dependent on geographic location and season, for example, the BRDF interpolation was most frequently applied in arid and semiarid regions, and during the dry season over humid climate vegetation types. Examples of a MODIS-like global NDVI map and associated quality flags were displayed using a pseudo color bit mapping scheme. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB Ice concentration data alone are often of limited use in many process, and modeling studies as different ice regimes of approximately 100% concentration can have significantly different heat flux, albedo, and other surface properties. Current ice concentration algorithms perform poorly in regions of predominantly thin or highly fragmented ice, which constitute a significant proportion of the pack in East Antarctica. The impact of the sea ice cover on high latitude air-sea interactions and marine ecology depends not only on ice extent and concentration but also on the ice-type composition of the pack. An unsupervised ice classification scheme, using data from four channels of the SSM/I, is presented and tested as a means of gaining important additional, complementary information on surface type. Class interpretation is by comparison with AVHRR, ERS-1 SAR, and near-coincident digital aerial photography and in situ data. The classification does a reasonable job at consistently differentiating the large-scale constituent regimes, including the outer marginal ice zone, the interior pack, and a transition zone separating the two. Given the short period of data analyzed, the cluster maps appear to be generally coherent and consistent through time as the pack changes in response to synoptic-scale atmospheric forcing, although the robustness of the technique needs further testing over longer time periods. An observed crossover int he meridional brightness temperature profiles is a dominant and consistent feature which marks the transition from unconsolidated and wet ice in the marginal ice zone to more consolidated ice with a thicker and drier snow cover in the interior pack. Ambiguities occur at the boundaries of some of these regimes due to sensor resolution limitations and the mixing of different ice types and open water. Also, some ice classes (like brash ice) cannot be distinguished from forming pancake ice. Furthermore, although the signature of the inner pack is usually distinct from that of the outer pack, we observed one extraordinary swell propagation event which led to ice fracturing and surface wetting, and significantly altered the surface classification. The results of this multiparameter study underline the importance of using multisensor systems synergistically to improve interpretation of passive microwave data and better characterize the complex Antarctic pack.

AB The objective of the paper is to study a physically based method of retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) parameters from global data sets of new generation wide field of view optical satellite sensors, such as POLDER/ADEOS, VGT/SPOT4, MODIS/EOS, MISR/EOS, MERIS/ENVISAT, and so forth. The method uses the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model of Kuusk (1995), which simultaneously predicts the spectral and directional behavior of reflectances, as a function of LAI, chlorophyll concentration, ratio of leaf size to canopy height, and other optical or structural parameters of the soil and vegetation. The same model is used irrespective of surface type, and no ancillary data is needed. This approach is evaluated with field and airborne data acquired over three different types of surfaces: Sahelian vegetation in the HAPEX-Sahel (1992) experiment, boreal forest in the BOREAS (1994) experiment, and cultivated nr-eas in the Alpilles (1996) experiment. The results shore that the LAI is restituted with a fair accuracy [root-mean-square (rms) difference between model results and observations of 0.70], better than that obtained with a semiempirical relation LAI-vegetation index. The daily fAPAR is restituted accurately, with a rms difference between measured and modeled fAPAR of 0.097. In the example of HAPEX, the model reproduces to some extent the temporal evolution of measured LAI and fAPAR. Reflectances reconstructed with the model are in acceptable agreement with observed reflectances, with a rms difference between observed and measured values of 0.017 on average. It is concluded that the retrieval of biophysical parameters from inversion of a BRDF model is promising from the perspective of a quantitative characterization of the terrestrial biosphere from space.

AB The ability to measure velocities of fast-moving glaciers is essential to the understanding and interpretation of their dynamics and related processes. This is especially important in the Jakobshavn drainage basin of the Greenland ice sheet, where a significant portion of the ice sheet mass loss occurs and the iceberg calving rate is high. In this article, zee present a method for using airborne laser altimetry data to determine surface velocities in portions of the Jakobshavn drainage basin that have distinct elevation features. By examining correlations between repeat elevation surveys, the motion of these features, the most distinct of which are crevasses, is tracked. Results show that for areas with a standard deviation in elevation in excess of 1 m, displacement of features can be tracked to a precision of 1-2 m, and the corresponding velocities can be retrieved. The maximum velocity of the Jakobshavn Isbrae, at its calving front, is found to be nearly 7 km yr(-1). Ice stream boundaries and flow patterns can also be observed in the derived velocity data.

AB Phenological differences among broadly defined vegetation types can be a basis for global scale landcover classification ata very coarse spatial scale. Using an annual sequence of composited normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values from AVHRR data set composited to 1 degrees DeFries and Townshend (1994) classified eleven global land-cover types with a maximum likelihood classifier. Classification of these same data using a neural network architecture called fuzzy ARTMAP indicate the following: i) When fuzzy ARTMAP is trained using 80% of the data and tested on the remaining (unseen) 20% of the data, classification accuracy is more than 85% compared with 78% using the maximum likelihood classifier; ii) classification accuracies for various splits of training/testing data show that an increase in the size of training data does not result in improved accuracies; iii) classification results vary depending on the use of latitude as an input variable similar to the results of DeFries and Townshed; and iv) fuzzy ARTMAP dynamics including a voting procedure and the numbrer of internal nodes can be used to describe uncertainty in classification. This study shows that artificial neural networks are a viable alternative for global scale landcover classification due to increased accuracy and the ability to provide additional information on uncertainty.

ID REMOTELY SENSED DATA; CROSS-VALIDATION; ERROR RATE; CLASSIFICATION;
   ACCURACY
AB There is abundant evidence that thematic map accuracy may vary across a landscape in a manner that is only partially related to land cover type. Spatial variation in accuracy may be attributable to factors such as terrain, landscape complexity, and land use patterns. There may be serious consequences in the construction and application of thematic maps when the pattern and degree of spatial variation of map accuracy is not understood. Classification error matrices, the usual summary of thematic map accuracy, are not a natural tool for analysing spatial variation in accuracy. This article presents a method of mapping spatially based estimates of map accuracy. We formulate a concept of misclassification probability and present a method of estimating misclassification probabilities at training observation locations. Misclassification probability estimates are then interpolated from the training locations to a lattice of points via Kriging. The last step uses the lattice to construct a contour accuracy map. We illustrate the method by constructing an accuracy map for a full Landsat Thematic Mapper scene covering a portion of central Idaho and western Montana, and a finer resolution accuracy map for a small area within that scene. The method is found to provide valuable information on the spatial distribution and variation of map accuracy for both decision-makers and GIS analysts. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB Global monitoring of land surface properties has primarily relied on the AVHRR red and near-infrared channels through use of the NDVI. The AVHRR Channel 3, centered at 3.75 mu m, has been shown to be sensitive to vegetation on a local scale. A method so separate the reflected and emitted components in this channel has been developed. The 3.75-mu m reflectivity is computed by subtracting the thermal contribution from the total signal and dividing the remaining signal component by atmospheric transmission and solar irradiance. The thermal contribution is estimated by using thermal infrared Channels 4 and 5 as well as NDVI to estimate infrared surface emissivities. The atmospheric transmission is computed with MODTRAN2 and uses integrated water vapor derived from the Split Window Technique. The formula derived are validated over ocean using sun glint observations and land using the FIFE-87 data set. Despite the uncertainties inherent to the procedure we adopted quantitative use of the derived reflectance at 3.75 mu m appears possible. Published by Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB The integration of the useful features of high and low spatial and temporal resolution satellite data is a major issue in remote sensing studies. The current work presents the development and testing of a procedure based on classification and regression analysis techniques for generating an NDVI data set with the spatial resolution of Landsat TM images and the temporal resolution of NOAA AVHRR maximum-value composites. The procedure begins with a classification of the high resolution TM data which yield land use references. These are degraded to low spatial resolution in order to procedure abundance images comparable with the AVHRR data. Linear regressions are then applied between the AVHRR NDVI data and the abundance images to estimate the profiles of the pure classes, which are then merged to the high spatial resolution classification outputs to generate an integrated data set. Experiments carried out in an area of Tuscany (Central Italy) intercomparing different strategies for each methodological step (hard and fuzzy classification, mean and Gaussian degradation, uni- and multivariate regression) identified an optimum methodology composed of fuzzy classification, mean degradation, and multivariate regression procedures.

TI Temporal mixture analysis of Arctic Sea ice imagery: A new approach for

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English

AB In this paper, we introduce the idea of temporal mixture analysis (TMA) for analysing long sequences of hypertemporal remote sensing imagery. The basis of this approach is spectral mixture analysis, which we adapt from the spectral domain to the time domain. The TMA procedure is demonstrated by applying it to a 9-year record of scanning multichannel microwave radiometer sea ice concentrations In the Northern Hemisphere. We find that end member fraction images provide a unique summary of spatial arrangements and temporal characteristics of the mapped phenomenon during a specific period and can be used to characterize climatic normals. A key distinction that differentiates temporal mixture imagery from similar images derived through more traditional means is that the data presented are derived from the temporal characteristics of the analyzed phenomenon and not the type of feature present.

AB Drought is one of the major environmental disasters in southern Africa. In recent years, the damage from droughts to the environment and economies of some countries was extensive, and the death toll of livestock and wildlife was unprecedented. Weather data often come from a very sparse meteorological network, incomplete and/or not always available in good time to enable relatively accurate and timely large scale drought detection and monitoring. Therefore, data obtained from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor on board the NOAA polar-orbiting satellites have been studied as a tool for drought monitoring and climate impact assessment in southern Africa. The AVHRR-based vegetation condition index (VCI) and temperature condition index (TCI) developed recently were used in this study because in other parts of the globe they showed goon results when used for drought detection and tracking, monitoring excessive soil wetness, assessment of weather impacts on vegetation, and evaluation of vegetation health and productivity. The results clearly show that temporal and spatial characteristics of drought in southern Africa can be detected, tracked, and mapped by the VCI and TCI indices. These results were numerically validated by in situ data such as precipitation, atmospheric anomaly fields, and agricultural crop yield. In the later case, it lans found that usable corn yield scenarios can be constructed from the VCI and TCI at approximately 6 (in some regions up to 13) weeks prior to harvest time. These indices can be especially beneficial when used together with ground data. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB Linear relationships (soil lines) between the conventional red (R) and near-infrared (NIR), and between unconventional NIR reflectance bans were investigated for the effects of spectral positioning and widths of approximately simulated bands of some broad- and narrow-band sensors, and for the influence of the chemical constituents and moisture in the samples. The investigation was based on laboratory spectra of air-dried samples from soil profiles from southeastern Brazil, an experiment for the chemical removal of organic mater, and on a wetting process of the soil samples. The relationships were evaluated for a general soil line and for the individual lines of some soil types, under air-dried condition, through the determination of the line parameters, dispersion statistics, and principal components analysis (PCA). Soil lines obtained with broad or narrow NIR bands positioned at shorter wavelengths, and consequently at smaller distance differences between the pair of bands, presented better fitted lines than the ones obtained with NIR bands located at longer wavelengths and at larger distances. compared with the broad bands, spectrally better positioned narrow NIR/R bands produced closely similar results because of the propitious effect of the larger bandwidth. However, unconventional NIR/NIR bands presented better fitted lines than the R/NIR bands. The inherent interplay between organic matter and iron oxides is accountable for the variability in th linear parameters of the individual lines. The general line for the samples considered is composed of nonparallel segments of the different soil types, with a tendency for a increased obliquity in the low albedo soils. Soil types with very low albedo present line slope values below 1, poor correlations, but small root mean square (RMS) values, whereas soil types with moderate and high albedo present line slope values above 1, strong correlations,and large RMS values. The former is rich in organic matter and iron oxides whereas the latter has more transparent components, such as quarts, or less opaque substances. However, in soil types with a lesser content of organic matter, the iron spectral features are enhanced and variations in the shape of the spectra are produced because of the larger reflectance increase in the R band than in the NIR interval. The maximum spectral contrast resulting from this compositional interplay is assessed when the NIR band is positioned at longer wavelengths. Similarly, soil wetting introduces nonlinear spectral changes that also affect the characteristics of the soil lines. The analysis of field measured reflectance spectra derived from an experiment designed to monitor the growth of a bean crop indicates hat the shift of the NIR band towards shorter wavelengths produces not only better fitted soil lines but also stronger vegetation signals. The enhancement of the vegetation signal obtained with the displacement of the NIR band results from the steeper descending slope towards longer wavelengths of the NIR plateau observed in the vegetation spectra. The results place constraints on a unsupported choice of bands to derive vegetation indices, especially those of the advanced hyperspectral imaging sensors. the most recommended pair of NIR-R bands for crop vegetation indices is the one from LANDSAT-TM, closely followed by JERS-OPS and SPOT-HRV, or from narrow NIR-R bands positioned within these ranges at spectral intervals not affected by atmospheric attenuation.

TI LEAFMOD: A new within-leaf radiative transfer model
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID REFLECTANCE; CANOPY; INDEX
AB We describe the construction and verification of a within-leaf radiative transfer model called LEAFMOD (Leaf Experimental Absorptivity Feasibility MODel). In the model, the one-dimensional radiative transfer equation in a slab of leaf material with homogeneous optical properties is solved. When run in the forward mode, LEAFMOD generates an estimate of leaf reflectance and transmittance given the leaf thickness and optical characteristics of the leaf material (i.e., the absorption and scattering coefficients). In the inverse mode, LEAFMOD computes the total within-leaf absorption and scattering coefficient profiles from measured reflectance, transmittance,and leaf thickness. Inversions with simulated data demonstrate that the model appropriately decouples scattering and adsorption within the leaf, producing fresh leaf absorption profiles with peaks at locations corresponding to the major absorption feature for water and chlorophyll. Experiments with empirical input data demonstrate that the amplitude of the fresh leaf absorption coefficient profile in the visible wavebands is correlated with pigment concentrations as determined by wet chemical analyses,and that absorption features in the near-infrared wavebands related to various other biochemical constituents can be identified in a dry-leaf absorption profile.

ID IMAGERY; AREA
AB AJERS-1 OPS (Japanese Earth Remote Sensing Satellite, Optical Sensor) image was used to make a methodological survey of the Mont-Saint-Michel foreshore (West of France). The main objective was to test different procedures for processing multispectral data between 520 nm and 2400 nm so as to refine the information acquired from other sensors such as Spot XS and Landsat TM which have a lower spectral and spatial discrimination potential. The use of multispectral satellite data enables a rapid reconnaissance of the zone where both sedimentological and morphological evolution occur according to the tides. The OPS sensor appears abbe to detect carbonate responses (Channel 6), especially in suspension in the turbid plume of the estuary water. JERS-OPS distinguished clearly between clays, vegetation, and the effect of phenomena likely to perturb their response, mainly moisture characterized by Channel 5. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID ALBEDO; COVER
AB While it is recognized that no single snow algorithm is capable of producing accurate global estimates of snow depth, for research purposes it is useful to test an algorithm's performance in different climatic areas in order to see how it responds to a variety of snow conditions. This study is one of the first to develop separate passive microwave snow algorithms for North American and Eurasia by including parameters that consider the effects of variations in forest cover sand crystal size on microwave brightness temperature. A new algorithm (GSFC 1996) is compared to a prototype algorithm (Chang et al., 1987) and to a snow depth climatology (SDC), which for this study is considered to be a standard reference or baseline. It is shown that the GSFC 1996 algorithm compares much more favorably to the SDC than does the Chang et al. (1987) algorithm. For example, in North American in February there is a 15% difference between the GSFC 1996 algorithm and the SDC, but with the Chang et al. (1987) algorithm the difference is greater than 50%. In Eurasia, also in February, there is only a 1.3% difference between the GSFC 1996 algorithm and the SDC, whereas with the Chang et al. (1987) algorithm the difference is about 20%. As expected, differences tend to be less when the snow cover extent is greater, particularly for Eurasia. The GSFC 1996 algorithm performs better in North America in each month than does the Chang et al. (1987) algorithm. This is also the case in Eurasia, except in April and May when the Chang et al. (1987) algorithm is in closer accord to the SDC than is the GSFC 1996 algorithm. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The in vivo laser-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (LICF) spectra of healthy and nutrient-deficient sunflower plants were measured on a Jobin Yvon monochromator with He-Ne laser excitation. To correctly determine the peak center and to evaluate the relative contributions of the bands in the total fluorescence spectrum, the steady state LICF spectra were analyzed with a nonlinear iterative procedure using Gaussian, Lorentzian, Pearson, Voigt, and exponential Gaussian spectral functions. It was observed that curve fitting performed by using two Gaussian peaks centered at 690 and 730 nm usually fits well to the chlorophyll fluorescence spectra. After curve fitting, the mean peak centers of the red and far-red chlorophyll bands of control plants were observed at 688.2 and 725.4 nm, respectively. A blue shift of as much as 9 nm in the peak position of the far-red band was observed with nutrient stress, whereas the shift in position of the red band was only of the order of a few nanometers. Further, the width at half maximum of the far-red band was found to increase by as much as 20 nm with nutrient stress. Curve fitting could thus separate out the red and far-red fluorescence spectra from a pair of normally distributed curves centered at 690 and 730 nm wavelengths, thereby differentiating the effects due to reabsorption from those due directly to changes in photosynthetic electron transport. The F690/F730 fluorescence intensity ratio obtained from curve-fitted parameters was found to be more sensitive to plant stress than were fluorescence values alone. Results indicate that a curve-fitting analysis of LICF spectra using Gaussian spectral functions is a very useful and sensitive method of evaluating spectral features from a statistically point of view and for accurate determination of contributions from constituent bands in the whole leaf fluorescence spectrum.

AB Ground surface temperatures retrieved from satellite data taken in mountain areas may have biases that depend strongly on the satellite viewing angle and the time of day. Biases occur whenever there is a correlation between the viewing angle and the temperatures of subpixel mountainsides, such as when the satellite's view directly faces the most brightly sunlit slopes. This paper reports simulations of this satellite-view bias effect for mountain terrain in central and southwestern Colorado and the southern Sierra Nevada in California. Surface temperatures for the simulations were computed by using a mesoscale numerical weather prediction model with a parameterization for terrain features that are at a scale finer than the model grid resolution. The representation of terrain in the simulations was based on elevation data with high resolution (30 m) from U.S. Geological Survey Digital Elevation Map data sets. Biases as large as 9 C degrees were found while assuming a satellite sensor resolution of 14 km. Even larger biases were found with finer sensor resolutions. These biases are substantially larger than those that had previously been found from modeling with terrain data at about 90 m resolution (3'' latitude/longitude) from the Defense Mapping Agency. The simulations suggest that satellite-view biases could cause substantial local errors when surface temperature retrievals are used for climate diagnosis, weather analysis, soil moisture estimation, or geologic mapping.

TI Model inversion of satellite-measured reflectances for obtaining surface
   biophysical and bidirectional reflectance characteristics of grassland
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CANOPY
AB An inversion method that can be used to derive information about biophysical and radiative conditions of a grassland surface from remotely sensed surface spectral reflectances is described. A previously developed simple surface bidirectional reflectance model was expanded for use in this inversion process. In the inversion process, a multidimensional optimization scheme is used to obtain a set of model parameters that minimizes the difference between modeled and observed reflectances. The effect of the slumber of data points used in the inversion on the accuracy of the model inversion was investigated with ground based hemispheric scan measurements of surface spectral reflectances over a tallgrass prairie in Kansas. The result shows that the total inversion error consists of minimum or systematic error and ambiguity error The former result from uncertainties in the accuracies of the model and measurements, whereas the latter is caused by the ambiguity of the model inversion when a limited number of data points are used The systematic error is independent of the number of data points, whereas the ambiguity error decreases sharply with increasing data points when the num ber of data points is small (fewer than about seven). An inversion method with appropriate data grouping applied to the reflectance data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer is shown to improve estimates of surface parameters over the grassland site. Relative differences between measured surface bidirectional reflectances and those calculated with the derived surface parameters range from 6% to 15% (12.9% for band 1 [0.65-0.67 mu m] 6.9% for band 2 [0.81-0.84 mu m] and 7.6% for band 3 [1.62-1.69 mu m]).

AB Thc biophysical, biochemical, and optical properties of 63 fresh leaves and 58 dry leaves were measured to investigate the potential of remote sensing to estimate the leaf biochemistry from space. Almost 2000 hemispherical reflectance and transmittance spectra were acquired from 400 nm to 2500 nm using a laboratory spectrophotometer. The amount of chlorophyll, water protein, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and starch was determined on these leaves using standard wet chemistry techniques. These experimental data were used to improve the PROSPECT model, a simple but effective radiative transfer model that calculates the leaf optical properties with a limited number of input parameters: a structure parameter and the leaf biochemistry. The new model construction mainly consisted in. providing specific absorption coefficients for the biochemical constituents; the comparison with absorption spectra of pure materials derived from the literature showed good agreement. In the inversion, however, it was necessary to group some leaf components in order to estimate leaf biochemistry with reasonable accuracy. Predictive power varied with the chemistry variable, wavelengths used in analysis, and whether leaves were fresh or dry. r(2) ranged from 0.39 to 0.88 for predictions on dry leaves; on fresh leaves, water and chlorophyll had high r(2) values, 0.95 and 0.68 respectively, carbon based compounds reasonable r(2), from 0.50 to 0.88, while the estimation of protein is still at issue.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Power spectra of optical depth tau for horizontally inhomogeneous clouds were compared to power spectra of corresponding near zenith-bidirectional reflectances and albedos. Although spectra for bidirectional reflectances resembled closely those of tau, albedo spectra were steeper. These bidirectional reflectances are similar to what nadir-viewing satellites would observe, whereas the albedos are approximately those that would be measured by aircraft-mounted pyranometers skimming cloudtops. Thus, tau inferred from zenith radiances should resemble true tau better than those inferred from albedos.
   Power spectra were also computed for albedos that would be measured at various heights above cloudtop. Spectra for fluxes at 100 m bore a strong resemblence to those measured at cloudtop: steeper than the corresponding tau spectrum. At 3000 m above cloudtop, however, series of albedo can be very complex and so too can their spectra. At barge spatial scales albedo spectra resembled that for tau, but at scales smaller than about 10 times the horizontal resolution of both tau and the albedo data, albedo spectra signified white noise. Thus, it is pointless to infer detailed cloud structure from albedo observations made high above cloudtops.

AB An algorithm is being developed to map global snow cover using Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data beginning at launch in 1998. As currently planned, digital maps will be produced that will provide daily, and perhaps maximum weekly, global snow cover at 500-m spatial resolution. Statistics will be generated on the extent and persistence of snow cover in each pixel for each weekly map, cloud cover permitting. It will also be possible to generate snow-cover maps at 250-m spatial resolution using MODIS data, and to study snow-cover characteristics. Preliminary validation activities of the prototype version of our snow-mapping algorithm, SNOMAP, have been undertaken. SNOMAP will use criteria tests and a decision rule to identify snow in each 500-m MODIS pixel. Use of SNOMAP on a previously mapped Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene of the Sierra Nevadas has shown that SNOMAP is 98% accurate in identifying snow in pixels that are snow covered by 60% or more. Results of a comparison of a SNOMAP classification with a Supervised-classification technique on. six other TM scenes show that SNOMAP and supervised-classification techniques agree to within about 11% or less for nearly cloud-free scenes and that SNOMAP provided more consistent results. About 10% of the snow cover known to be present on the 14 March 1991 TM scene covering Glacier National Park in northern Montana, is obscured by dense forest cover. Mapping snow cover in areas of dense forests is a limitation in the use of this procedure for global snow-cover mapping. This limitation, and sources of error will be assessed globally as SNOMAP is refined and tested before and following the launch of MODIS.

AB The importance of atmospheric correction of reflectances measured with the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for biophysical studies using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is examined for a study area in the Sahel for which measurements of aerosol and water vapor were available. During the rainy season atmospheric aerosols were relatively more variable than water vapor. Atmospheric corrections were applied to Channel 1 (red) and Channel 2 (near-infrared) for the effects of molecular absorption and Rayleigh scatter, aerosol scatter and absorption, and water vapor absorption. The results were expressed as the difference between corrected and uncorrected reflectances (Delta rho). In Channel 1 the magnitude and variability of Delta rho was mostly caused by aerosols. In Channel 2 the magnitude of Delta rho was caused by water vapor, but most of the variability was caused by aerosols. Most of the degradation in the NDVI signal (Delta nu iota) was caused by water vapor but the variability in Delta nu iota was caused by both water vapor and aerosol. Atmospheric corrections using seasonal averages of atmospheric water vapor and aerosol optical depths resulted in corrections that were similar to the full corrections using daily values. In the Sahel it may therefore be acceptable to use average values for the atmospheric variables to correct satellite data when sunphotometer data are not available, although the effects of interannual variability in mean atmospheric conditions are not known.

TI ESTIMATION OF SOIL AND CROP PARAMETERS FOR WHEAT FROM AIRBORNE RADAR

ID AGRICULTURAL CROPS; BARE SOIL; MOISTURE
AB The study of radar backscattering signatures of wheat fields was investigated, using data collected on the Orgeval agricultural watershed (France) by the airborne scatterometer ERASME in C and X bands, HH and VV polarizations, at incidence angles from 15 degrees to 45 degrees, during two years for different soil moisture conditions with simultaneous ground-based measurements. A simple parameterization as water-cloud model with two driving parameters (the surface soil moisture and the plant water content) gives satisfactory results to estimate radar cross sections of wheat for a wide range of frequencies (C and X bands) and incidence angles (20 degrees and 40 degrees) within 1 dB in CHH and XHH and 2 dB in CVV and XVV. At the lower frequency (C band) the attenuated soil backscattering by the vegetation is dominant. It is shown that simple linear relations in C band between radar cross section and soil moisture are insufficient. A correction term for the vegetation attenuation is needed and is determined. Low contrast between the backscattering of dry and wet soil (around 6 dB) for a given vegetation density leads to a relatively high error in the estimation of soil moisture by radar (0.06 cm(3)/cm(3)). At the higher frequency (X band), the radar backscattering is negatively correlated to the vegetation water content with a saturation of the radar cross section as the plant grows (about 6 dB of dynamic range between low and fully grown canopy) with no dependence on. the soil signal. The achievable accuracy in the estimation of crop water content is the same at 20 degrees and 40 degrees and higher in XHH (about 0.5 kg/m(2)) than in XVV.

AB A pattern recognition method and a spatial integration filtering method have been developed to analyze satellite altimeter sea surface elevation anomaly (SSEA) data for the tropical Pacific Ocean. The pattern recognition method treats SSEA as an independent variable of the ocean, and SSEA map, its two-dimensional distribution image, as similar to a normal satellite image. The results of the pattern recognition processing of the SSEA maps quantitatively reveal the information of the movement of SSEA patterns. The spatial integration filtering method is used as low-pass filtering to detect the equatorial Kelvin waves from Geosat SSEA time series data. The wave patterns and the frequency spectra are derived from SSEA data. This article describes these two methods, including an overview of the algorithms used and the results derived. Further applications of the methods are then suggested.

AB Branch samples were collected from canopies of red spruce (Picea rubens) and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) on 11 and 12 September 1989 and 5 and 6 September 1990, and spectrally characterized by needle age class (first- and second-year). Needles from the branch samples were analyzed for complete optical properties (0.4-1.0 mum), pigment content (total chlorophylls), and anatomical (cellular) condition. Spectral differences between spruce and hemlock first- and second-year needles include differences in green peak reflectance features, red edge parameters, and amplitude features of the NIR plateau. Second-year needles of both species exhibit increased absorptance in the NIR when compared with first-year needles. Chlorophyll concentrations, as determined using both quantitative and empirical techniques [ratio analysis of reflectance spectra (RARS)] were greater in second-year needles in both species and highest overall in second-year hemlock needles. Substantial anatomical differences are seen between needles of the two species, as well as between age classes of the same species. Relative differences among total area occupied by cells, intercellular void space, and total needle volume likely contribute to the differences in the NIR response patterns observed. The reflectance spectra (0.4-2.5 mum) measured for single age-class branch segments of both species are similar in shape to reflectance spectra measured at the needle level. However, differences in the magnitude of reflectance are seen when branch and needle data are compared.

AB This article presents a parameterization of multiple scattering by the atmosphere over a Lambertian surface for wavelengths corresponding to the shortwave channels of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The method is developed by first considering scattering and absorption in the molecular atmosphere, in the absence of aerosols. Using this parameterization as a basis, the technique is extended to include aerosols, which are represented as being confined to thin layers. Physical variables retained explicitly in the parameterization include the surface albedo and the geometry Of sun, target, and observer. The parameterization is computationally efficient and does not require extensive tabulations. Accuracy is typically better than 5 % in the scattered component of the radiance and better than 1 % in the total radiance for aerosol optical depths up to 0. 20, over the full range of viewing geometry of the AVHRR. Errors in recovered surface albedo are considered in relation to uncertainties in the aerosol properties. An example is presented illustrating the.application of the algorithm to the removal of atmospheric effects from vegetation indices.

AB This study aims at determining relationships between water quality parameters and digital data from the Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM). The study area was the Guanabara Bay, in Rio de janeiro, Brazil. Water samples were collected on two dates, coincident with Landsat passages, and when different tide conditions were present at the Bay. TM Bands 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, band ratios 113 and 2/3, and principal component analysis of TM Bands 1-4 were compared with in situ measurements and laboratory analysis of water samples. Some water quality parameters were very well correlated with the digital remotely sensed data, especially during high tide: for instance, iron and manganese concentrations in total suspended solids; salinity and Secchi depth; temperature and Secchi depth; temperature and total suspended solids; total suspended solids and Bands 4 and 6; Secchi depth and Bands 4 and 6; temperature and Band 6. Lower correlation coefficients, although also significant, were found for the low tide condition. No correlation was found with chlorophyll-a concentrations. TM data were shown to be adequate to analyze temperature, Secchi depth, total suspended solids, and iron and manganese contents in the total suspended solids for the polluted estuary area studied.

AB This study relates Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery to ground measurements Of vegetation distribution, physiology, and productivity at Stanford University's jasper Ridge Biological Preserve. Primary efforts focused on a 9-ha region of annual grassland where we completed a detailed ground-based study in conjunction with a 15 May 1991 AVIRIS overflight. Spectral mixture analysis and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from AVIRIS data were used to evaluate spatial patterns Of vegetation type, productivity, and potential physiological activity. Concurrent ground sampling revealed a high degree of correlation between NDVI and estimates Of canopy chemistry, structure, productivity, and CO2 fluX, supporting the use of imaging spectrometry to estimate spatial and temporal trends in vegetation physiology and productivity in this relatively simple grassland ecosystem. Geostatistical analyses of both ground and AVIRIS data supported the conclusion that the AVIRIS pixel size was suitable for describing the influence of major landscape features in this grassland and that spatial detail would be lost at slightly larger pixel sizes typical of other imaging spectrometers. Analysis of fine spectral features in AVIRIS data may provide new ways of assessing physiological activity in evergreen tree and shrub communities where photosynthetic activity was not correlated with green canopy display.

   ASSUMPTION; CANOPY
AB An Automated Bidirectional Reflectance Acquisition Measurement System (ABRAMS) has been constructed to facilitate measurement of bidirectional reflectance from soil and vegetative samples in the laboratory. The system illuminates a sample with linearly-polarized laser light, lambda = 632.8 nm, and measures the like- and cross-polarized scattered intensities over half a hemisphere. System design and polarized bidirectional reflectance measurements from a soil sample and SiO2 spherical particles are discussed in this work. It is shown that polarization information in the plane of incidence is useful for identifying certain scattering mechanisms associated with soil reflectance. This is because the like-polarized intensity, I(VV), is influenced by single-scattered light and the cross-polarized intensity, I(HV), is strongly influenced by multiple-scattered light. For example, comparable levels of I(VV) and I(HV), indicated that the reflectance of soils, especially those made up of translucent particles, is dominated by significant multiple scattering because single scattering causes minimal depolarization in the plane of incidence. Furthermore, I(HV) is less dependent on the illumination angle (hence, more Lambertian) than I(VV), indicating that the scattering mechanisms which caused them are not the same.

Surface reflectance can be retrieved from remotely sensed data. However, absolute values independent of atmospheric turbidity and surface altitude can only be obtained after removing masking effects of the atmosphere. An atmospheric correction model, accounting for surface and sensor altitudes above sea level, is described and validated through data detected over Antarctic surfaces with a Barnes Modular Multispectral Radiometer having bands overlapping those of the Landsat Thematic Mapper. The model is also applied in a sensitivity analysis to investigate error induced in reflectance obtained from satellite data by indeterminacy in optical parameters of atmospheric constituents. Results show that indeterminacy in the atmospheric water vapor optical thickness is the main source of nonaccuracy in the retrieval of surface reflectance from data remotely sensed over Antarctic regions.

AB In response to the need for a simple atmospheric correction method and the consequent verification of such a method, an experiment was conducted to acquire a data set suitable for testing atmospheric correction procedures under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Several procedures, including radiative transfer codes (RTCs) with simulated atmospheres, image-based procedures and dark-object subtraction (DOS), were evaluated by comparing surface reflectance factors derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) digital data with low-altitude, aircraft-based measurements for seven dates over a 1-year period. Acceptable results, approximately +/0.02 reflectance (1-sigma-RMS), were achieved based on an RTC with appropriate simulated atmospheres. The DOS technique was the least accurate method and, in fact, produced greater error in estimations of near-IR reflectance than no correction at all. Two hybrid approaches, which combined the image-based nature of DOS with the precision of an RTC, provided sufficient accuracy and simplicity to warrant consideration for use on an operational basis. Though these results were probably site-specific (characterized by relatively low aerosol levels and low humidity), they illustrate the feasibility of simple atmospheric correction methods and the usefulness of a diverse data set for validation of such techniques.

ID LEAF-AREA INDEX; VEGETATION CANOPIES; RADIATION; CORN
AB Bidirectional reflectance of six maize genotypes was measured on 16 dates in 1984 at the Nebraska Sandhills Laboratory using a modular multiband radiometer. On 10 of the dates, measurements were repeated during the day to obtain a range of solar zenith angles. Plants were sampled approximately weekly to determine leaf area index (LAI) and smoothed to provide LAI values for each of the 560 reflectance measurements. Reflectance in the red and near-infrared (NIR) was predicted by three versions of the SAIL model, a one-dimensional version, a two-dimensional version that took rows into account, and a modified two-dimensional version that accounted for shading caused by rows and crop height, and then evaluated using an accuracy analysis that considered bias, regression, and random errors. The results indicated that the 1-D SAIL model underestimated red and overestimated NIR reflectance at partial canopies because it did not account for exposed bare soil. The 2-D version, which accounted for ground cover, generally overcame this problem. The 2-D' version, which accounted for shading of soil and canopy due to increasing canopy height, did not improve the results of the 2-D version enough to warrant the increased complexity. Sensitivity analyses, in which the main inputs required to fit the data were varied, revealed that the same leaf angle distribution and the same single leaf reflectance and transmittance values could be used for the whole season. Diurnal, multitemporal reflectance combined with the SAIL model adequately described the radiative transfer properties of the maize crop canopies studied.

TI SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF LAND SURFACE EMISSIVITY IN THE THERMAL INFRARED
   BAND - SPECTRAL SIGNATURE AND EFFECTIVE SURFACE-TEMPERATURE
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Experimental access to effective surface parameters, surface temperature, and emissivity, relevant to satellite investigations in the thermal infrared band (TIR), is addressed and discussed. The spatial variability of the broad (8-14-mu-m) emissivity was measured over an overall homogeneous area with a movable measuring system. Spectral ground radiances were also measured at many places, the spatial average of which is assumed to represent the effective spectral ground radiance. The effective surface temperature is obtained through renormalization of the effective emissivity signature over the RMS broad band emissivity previously measured. The method is shown to produce the effective surface temperature with an accuracy better than 1 K, without any direct temperature measurement. From the effective signature, the channel emissivities pertaining to a given instrument can be calculated. This has been done for NOAA-11/AVHRR Channels 4 and 5. A preliminary test was made to try and validate nighttime satellite-derived surface temperature by comparison with field effective temperature. The image was acquired during the field experiment. The first result of this attempt is encouraging, although only qualitative because of standard atmospheric corrections. Orientation of future work for better accuracy and reliability is discussed as well.

Simultaneous plant physiological data and canopy polarization and reflectance data were collected before and after the tasseling development stage of the corn canopy, and before and during a period when the soybean canopy was water stressed.  A simple model based upon the hypothesis that leaves specularly reflect light according to the Fresnel equations relates the observed bidirectional effects to the architectural and phenological conditions of the canopy.

TI CORRECTION OF BIHEMISPHERICAL REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS FOR NONCOSINE
   RESPONSE OF 2-PI STERADIAN OPTICS - A METHODOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATION TO
   ANTARCTIC SURFACES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SOLAR-RADIATION; RADIANCE
AB Bihemispherical reflectance of the earth's surfaces is an important parameter in climatology because of its role in the energy exchange between atmosphere and biosphere. Experimental values of bihemispherical reflectance can be obtained by exitance and irradiance measurements performed with 2-pi steradian radiometers provided that the noncosine response of optics, which could strongly affect the retrieved bihemispherical reflectance as a function of the sun zenith, is accounted for in data analysis.  By modeling exitance and irradiance measurable by a 2-pi steradian radiometer, accounting for the angular transmission function of optics and sky radiance nonisotropy, theoretical factors have been computed to correct the bihemispherical reflectance obtained from exitance and irradiance measurements.  Simulation of measurements related to different Antarctic field conditions shows the low sensitivity of the computed correcting factors to the atmospheric optical thickness at sun zenith less than 75-degrees.  This fact suggests the use of climatological data in computations, avoiding additional in situ measurements, which could reduce the operational use of the correction methodology.  Multispectral measurements taken in Victoria Land, with a radiometer working in the same bands as the Landsat MultiSpectral Scanner (MSS), have been elaborated following the proposed correction scheme.  Bihemispherical reflectance of fresh snow, which could have an unreliable value higher than 1.0 at high sun zenith angles when computed with exitance and irradiance taken by noncosine collector optics, has shown good agreement with published data.

AB Measurements of gap probability, defined as the probability that a photon of direct illumination at a given zenith angle will penetrate a tree canopy, were made for some moderate-sized, open-grown conifers of varying species in the National Arboretum, Washington, D.C.  The measurements were collected by rationing the standardizing readings in red and near-infrared bands of two radiometers with 6-degrees fields of view that were pointed directly at the sun.  One radiometer was located within the shadow of the conifer tree; the other was placed outside of the shadow.  The path length associated with each radiometric measurement was calculated by fitting a simple conical geometric model to each tree from measurements of tree height and width.  The radiometric measurements are best fit by a binomial model in which sunlight is either unobstructed or fully attenuated, and analysis shows that the gap probability, which is taken as the mean of the binomial, fits a negative exponential function of path length quite well.  The conifer shadow, then, is an object of almost uniform darkness with some bright holes or gaps that are found near the shadow's edge but rapidly disappear toward the shadow's center.

ID CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS; CLASSIFICATION; RESOLUTION
AB The reflectance values of pixels, recorded by remote sensors, are often generated by more than one ground phenomenon.  This, the so-called mixed pixel problem, has always been a property of scanner-type imaging, but its effect on the image classification process is arguably still a major problem to deriving accurate land cover maps, in spite of the increasing spatial resolution of sensors.  This paper explores use of a fuzzy classifier to determine the constituent land cover components of pixels in a suburban environment.  The classifier derives a measure of the fuzzy membership of a pixel belonging to each land cover class.  For some land cover types including water, wetland, and woodland, a high correlation is shown between the fuzzy membership values for a pixel and the portion of the area of that pixel which belongs to a particular land cover type.  The correlation for other land cover types is statistically significant but qualitatively poorer, and may indicate a lack of signature purity.  The results show that the fuzzy classifier may enable the extraction of information about individual pixels and about subpixel phenomena not addressed by other classifiers.

   freshwater resources

AB Ensuring freshwater availability and supply sufficient for socio-economic development is important for human health and productivity. Globally, increasing industrial agriculture is driving crop productivity, with increasing surface water and groundwater being withdrawn for irrigation. This study mapped center pivot irrigation systems (CPIS), which are indicators of intensified industrial agriculture and large-scale investment in agriculture, with satellite data using a convolutional neural network in global arid areas. A cascade instance segmentation network was adopted, and both the convolutional block attention module technique and PointRend technique were used to increase the performance of off-the-shelf algorithms. Geospatial analysis methods were used to derive the relationships between CPIS and freshwater resources. Overall there were about 10.26 million hectares (Mha) of irrigated areas equipped with CPIS in global arid areas in 2021, and there were 4.41 Mha of CPISequipped irrigated fields added in the past twenty years at a relative increase of 75% compared with those at the beginning of this century. Although the largest extent of increased CPIS-equipped irrigated fields was in North America, the other five continents had higher relative increases, with Africa having the highest relative growth of 253%. The analysis of spatial relationships between CPIS and freshwater resources indicates that the stress on freshwater resources from industrial agriculture is intensifying in arid areas globally. Overall, the world's arid regions with the highest water stress from CPIS are mostly located in western North America, northern Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula. The results facilitate a better understanding of the current status of freshwater stress and ecosystem sustainability in relation to the development of agricultural intensification in global arid areas. The outcomes support governments to judge better the environmental consequences of agricultural modernization and further help them make balanced agriculture and water management policies.

AB Snow water equivalent (SWE) is a critical input for weather, climate, and water resource management models at local to global scales. Despite its importance, global SWE measurements that are accurate, consistent, and at sufficiently high spatiotemporal resolutions are not currently available. L-band interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques have been used to measure SWE at local to regional scales, and two upcoming L-band SAR satellite missions have renewed interest in these techniques to provide regular SWE measurements at the global scale. However, previous research demonstrating the capabilities of L-band InSAR-SWE measurement has been limited to mountain or tundra snowpack regimes. Here we examine the feasibility of applying the same techniques over a prairie snowpack, which are typically characterized by shallow snow depths (mean snow depth of 0.22 m in this study), exposed agricultural vegetation, and high spatial variability over short distances. Our study area in central Montana, USA (47.060,-109.951) was a validation site for NASA SnowEx 2021, as part of the UAVSAR snow timeseries. Airborne L-band SAR imagery was acquired by the UAVSAR platform while concurrent snow measurements were collected using uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-based LiDAR, UAV-based photogrammetry, and ground-based manual techniques. This validation dataset enables an investigation of the effects of sub-pixel snow cover heterogeneity and exposed agricultural vegetation stubble on SAR data and the resulting SWE estimations. Results based on repeated application of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test show that UAVSAR VV phase change is sensitive to differences in snow cover but relatively unaffected by differences in agricultural stubble height. However, we did not find similarly definitive results when we used the same phase change data to estimate SWE. Although broad spatial patterns were similar in both LiDAR-derived and InSAR-derived SWE estimates, considerable differences in the two estimates were apparent in areas with large sub-pixel snow depth variability. Our results indicate that additional work is necessary to derive accurate SWE estimates in prairie environments. Regular measurements from L-band SAR satellites will provide an excellent opportunity to refine InSAR-based snow estimation techniques over shallow, heterogeneous snowpacks.

AB The spectral power coefficient (eta) of the particulate backscattering coefficient (b(bp)(lambda)) is directly estimated from the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda)) with a neural network-based scheme (NN eta) in this study. Evaluations with both synthetic dataset and in-situ measurements show that NN eta could significantly improve the accuracy of estimated eta compared to several conventional schemes reported in the literature that are based on chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl), band ratios of R-rs(lambda), or remotely sensed b(bp)(lambda). Demonstrations with measurements from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua further confirm the robustness of NN eta, where reasonable spatial distribution and seasonality of eta in the global oceans can be acquired by NN eta. High and low eta values are observed in the oligotrophic gyres and the coastal zones, respectively, which are consistent with the current understanding of eta distribution concluded from theoretic analysis and repeated field measurements in the global ocean. Implementation of NN eta to 19-year MODIS monthly composite measurements from 2003 to 2021 reveals strong seasonal variations of eta in most of the global ocean, but the decadal changes of eta are insignificant in the majority (similar to 82.2%) of the global ocean. Similar to any empirical algorithms, the performance of NN eta is dependent on the training dataset, particularly its range, here a proper upper limit of eta for natural waters is provided.

AB Urbanization experiences different speeds and forms under diverse development stages across the globe. However, urbanization-induced impacts on long-term surface urban heat island intensity (I-s) trends across global cities and the regulators of such impacts remain understudied Here we estimate interannual trends in daytime I-s (i.e., urban-rural differences in surface temperatures) across 511 major cities for 1985-2020 using annual averages calculated using reconstructed land surface temperature data derived from >250,000 Landsat thermal images. Our study reveals that the global mean I-s growth rate is 0.156 degrees C/decade. We further examine I-s change associated with per 1% impervious land growth (denoted as beta) in each city throughout the research period and during different periods. The global mean beta is 0.018 +/- 0.025 degrees C/% (mean +/- 1 standard deviation) for the whole period, with greater values in humid than in arid climates; and the beta may change during different periods, e.g., it has more than tripled when urban impervious land exceeds 30%, indicating the spatiotemporally divergent impacts of urbanization on I-s trends across global cities. The spatial variations in beta across global cities are well correlated with rural vegetation abundance and precipitation but not with urban population. Among these three factors, rural vegetation abundance possesses the greatest standardized regression coefficient of partial least-squares model, signifying the critical role of biome background in regulating beta. The finding implies that future urbanization over densely vegetated regions should be more carefully and strategically planned due to the greater urbanization-induced surface warming effect.

ID ACCURACY
AB Land-use land-cover (LULC) change is one of the most important anthropogenic threats to biodiversity and ecosystems integrity. As a result, the systematic generation of annual regional, national, and global LULC map products derived from the classification of satellite imagery data have become critical inputs for multiple scientific disciplines. The importance of quantifying pixel-level uncertainty to improve the robustness of downstream analyses has long been acknowledged but this practice is still not widely adopted in the generation of these LULC products. The lack of uncertainty quantification is likely due to the fact that most approaches that have been put forward for this task are too computationally intensive for large-scale analysis (e.g., bootstrapping). In this article, we describe how conformal statistics can be used to quantify pixel-level uncertainty in a way that is not computationally intensive, is statistically rigorous despite relying on few assumptions, and can be used together with any classification algorithm that produces class probabilities. Our simulation results show how the size of the predictive sets created by conformal statistics can be used as an indicator of classification uncertainty at the pixel level. Our analysis based on data from the Brazilian Amazon reveals that both forest and water have high certainty whereas pasture and the "natural (other)" category have substantial uncertainty. This information can guide additional ground-truth data collection and the resulting raster combining the LULC classification with the uncertainty results can be used to communicate in a transparent way to downstream users which classified pixels have high or low uncertainty. Given the importance of systematic LULC maps and uncertainty quantification, we believe that this approach will find wide use in the remote sensing community.

AB Cloud base heights (CBHs) play an important role in weather and climate studies, but remain one of the most challenging properties to be inferred using passive satellite spectral instruments. This is because spectral signals detected from space are mainly from cloud tops and contain minimal information on cloud vertical structures owing to limited penetration. This paper presents a new algorithm for retrieving CBH from radiometer mea-surements, utilizing an improved characterization for mutable cloud water contents (CWCs). This was achieved by introducing a variable named effective CWC (ECWC) to represent the vertically varying CWC; and subse-quently investigating the sensitivity of ECWC to both cloud and environmental properties. Considering these characteristics, a systematic ECWC lookup table (LUT) was created based on collocated active and passive sat-ellite observations. We then converted the existing cloud water path (CWP; kg/m2) to cloud geometric thickness (CGT; km) via the developed LUT, and calculated CBH by subtracting the CGT estimates from conventional cloud top height (CTH) retrievals. The algorithm was tested using observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) as examples, and was evaluated using active measurements from the CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CAL -IPSO) satellites and a ground-based Ka-band radar. Overall, our CBH results agreed closely with the active ob-servations, with mean biases of 0.11 & PLUSMN; 1.93 km for MODIS and -0.12 & PLUSMN; 2.34 km for AHI in single-layer cloud cases. Despite the natural limitations on retrieving CBHs using passive radiometers, the proposed algorithm achieves retrieval accuracies comparable to those of operational CTH products. Moreover, this algorithm works for both single-layer and overlapping clouds, and can be extended to other passive radiometers by reconstructing the LUT. Such accurate CBH information derived from high-resolution passive radiometers would greatly improve our understanding of cloud vertical distributions; and could play an important role in studies of cloud radiative effects and the aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions.

AB Spring phenology of temperate ecosystems is highly sensitive to climate change, generating various impacts on many important terrestrial surface biophysical processes. Although various prognostic models relying on environmental variables of temperature and photoperiod have been developed for spring phenology, comprehensive ecosystem-scale evaluations over large landscapes and long-time periods remain lacking. Further, environmental variables other than temperature and photoperiod might also importantly constrain spring phenology modelling but remain under-investigation. To address these issues, we leveraged around 20-years datasets of environmental variables (from Daymet and GLDAS products) and the spring phenology metric (i.e., the greenup date) respectively derived from MODIS and PhenoCams across 108 sites in the Northern and Eastern United States. We firstly cross-compared MODIS-derived greenup date with official PhenoCams product with high accuracy (R2 = 0.70). Then, we evaluated the three prognostic models (i.e., Growing Degree Date (GDD), Sequential (SEQ) and optimality-based (OPT)) with MODIS-derived spring phenology, assessed the model residuals and their associations with soil moisture, rainfall, and solar radiation, and revised the two photoperiod-relevant models (SEQ, OPT) by replacing the daylength variable with solar radiation, which was found to contribute the most to model residuals. We found that 1) all models demonstrated good capability in characterizing spring phenology, with OPT performing the best (RMSE = 8.04 +/- 5.05 days), followed by SEQ (RMSE = 10.57 +/- 7.77 days) and GDD (RMSE = 10.84 +/- 8.42 days), 2) all models displayed high model residuals showing tight correlation with solar radiation (r = 0.45-0.75), and 3) the revised models that included solar radiation significantly performed better with an RMSE reduction by 22.08%. Such results are likely because solar radiation better constrains early growing season plant photosynthesis than photoperiod, supporting the hypothesis of spring phenology as an adaptive strategy to maximize photosynthetic carbon gain (approximated by solar radiation) while minimizing frost damage risk (captured by temperature). Collectively, our study reveals the underappreciated importance of solar radiation in constraining spring phenology of temperate ecosystems, and suggests ways to improve spring phenology modelling and other phenology-related ecological processes.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) over urban areas is an essential parameter in the monitoring of urban thermal environment. Urbanization has resulted in a more complex geometric structure of urban surface than natural surface. However, in the conventional LST retrieval algorithms, the impact of urban geometric structure is usually neglected. In this study, an extended algorithm that combines the split-window algorithm (SW) and the temperature and emissivity separation algorithm (TES) was proposed to retrieve LST and land surface emissivity (LSE) over urban areas simultaneously from the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) thermal infrared (TIR) data. In the extended SW-TES algorithm with considering urban geometry effect, the brightness temperature at ground level was obtained using the SW algorithm, and the LST and LSE were retrieved simultaneously by using the TES algorithm. The results indicate that LST (LSE) retrieved by the extended SW-TES algorithm with urban geometry effect correction has generally lower (higher) values than that without urban geometry effect correction. The LST differences mostly vary from 0.3 K to 1.2 K, whereas the LSE differences are mainly concentrated between-0.01 and -0.06. Furthermore, the root mean squared error (RMSE) between LST/LSE retrieved by the extended SW-TES algorithm with urban geometry effect correction and LST/LSE obtained from the ECOSTRESS level-2 LST/LSE product decrease with the increase of sky view factor (SVF). The largest RMSE is approximately 1.6 K for LST and 0.03 for LSE in the SVF of 0.1, which represents an urban pixel surrounded by high buildings within its adjacent pixels. There are no evident differ-ences between LST/LSE retrieved by the extended SW-TES algorithm with urban geometry effect correction using five and three ECOSTRESS TIR bands. The LST differences are mainly concentrated between-0.2 K and 0.2 K, whereas the LSE differences mostly range from 0.001 to 0.004. The findings of this study indicate that it is necessary to consider urban geometry effect for accurate LST and LSE retrieval over urban areas.

AB The CALIOP instrument has demonstrated tremendous potential in terms of oceanic detection. Nighttime mea-surements from spaceborne lidar increase knowledge of the diurnal variability of ocean optical properties, while measurements in polar regions fill the gaps that passive measurements of ocean color may leave in these areas. However, due to non-ideal instrumental characteristics, errors may occur during retrieval of the ocean optical properties that are derived directly from CALIOP's measured signals. These errors are caused by the transient response (TR) function of the detectors and the polarization crosstalk (CT) between the polarization beam splitters. However, there is no study that integrates and explicitly describes both the required corrections. In addition, the published physics-based methods for retrieving the particulate backscatter coefficient (bbp) from CALIOP use an empirical linear relationship between bbp and the backscatter coefficient at 180 degrees b(pi) without considering the spatial and temporal variability associated with the conversion coefficient. In this study, after both effects are eliminated through TR deconvolution and CT correction, an innovative deep neural network (DNN) approach is proposed to retrieve bbp and particulate organic carbon (POC) from CALIOP. The DNN is trained with the CALIOP total ocean column-integrated depolarization ratio and subsurface column-integrated perpendicular backscatter data, which are combined with the collocated daytime MODIS bbp and POC prod-ucts. Once the DNN has been trained with the daytime MODIS product, measurements can be derived from CALIOP in conditions not covered by MODIS data, such as at night or in polar regions. Compared to published physics-based methods, this approach does not require diffuse attenuation coefficients, nor are additional as-sumptions regarding the conversion coefficient between bbp and the backscatter coefficient at 180 degrees b(pi) neces-sary. A comparison of global total depolarization ratios, which are calculated before and after TR deconvolution and CT correction, indicates the necessity and efficacy of correction, and the preliminary results show that the oceanic properties derived from CALIOP via this DNN-based approach agree better with the MODIS products than those derived with the traditional physics-based methods. The use of lidar measurements to derive bbp and POC without relying on passively acquired data is of great interest to the ocean color community.

AB Entering the SAR's golden era began with the launch of Sentinel-1A/B satellites in 2014 and 2016 with 6-12 day revisit time, much larger stacks of high-resolution SAR images are available over a given area to perform time series analysis. Algorithms that deal with large stack sizes face several challenges, including interferometric phase quality degradation due to signal decorrelations, phase closure error caused by applied multilooking, and tropospheric phase delay. Here, we present an improved SBAS-type algorithm suitable for processing a large stack of SAR images at an arbitrary resolution. We develop a new pair selection strategy that applies dyadic downsampling combined with widely used Delaunay Triangulation to identify an optimal set of interferometric pairs that minimize systematic errors due to short-lived signals and closure errors. We develop and apply a novel statistical framework that selects elite pixels accounting for distributed and permanent scatterers. Also, we implement a new tropospheric error correction that takes advantage of smooth 2D splines to identify and remove error components with fractal-like structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms by applying them to 3 large datasets of Sentinel-1 SAR images measuring non-linear surface deformation over various terrains. Compared with independent GNSS observations, we find that over the rural/natural terrains adjacent to San Andreas fault in southern California, our approach yields a standard deviation of 0.48 cm for time series differences in both ascending and descending tracks. While in urban areas, such as Los Angeles, standard deviation difference with GNSS time series is 0.30 cm.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer simulations are critical for studying the radiometric properties of canopies. Efficient and easy-to-use 3D radiative transfer models are required by remote sensing inversion and many validation applications. Extensive efforts have been made to improve the computational effi-ciency, accuracy, and useability of 3D radiative transfer models. This study focuses on the abstraction of canopies for 3D radiative transfer simulations by proposing a lightweight boundary-based description of leaf clusters (B-cluster) to ease the creation of 3D scenes while keeping the simulation as accurate as possible. B -cluster partitions a tree crown into sub-crown leaf clusters and abstracts each of them into a turbid medium enclosed by a complex and tight boundary, while terrain and branches are described with precise mesh surfaces. The radiative transfer simulation within B-cluster has been developed based on an efficient Monte Carlo path-tracing algorithm and implemented in the LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation framework (LESS) model by considering the presence of both turbid medium and surface scattering. The performance of the model was assessed by comparing with original LESS version, which describes all landscape elements with mesh surfaces (here called M-surface approach), and with a uniform voxel-based approach (U-voxel) in terms of the multiangle bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) as well as with pixel -wise images. Results show that B-cluster is highly consistent with M-surface in abstract canopies (mean normalized absolute BRF differences delta) < 2%) and in realistic forest stand (delta) < 5% at 5-m resolution) with considerably reduced requirements for computational memory. Compared with U-voxel, B-cluster is also more robust and better at describing canopy structures with different levels of detail. B-cluster enables to quickly construct accurate 3D scenes with reduced requirements of computational resources. It is also a unified and scale-adaptive approach that can describe crowns as simple as geometric primitives and as complex as explicitly described meshes. The newly proposed approach has been released in new LESS ver-sions at http://lessrt.org/.

AB Effective calibration of microwave scattering model and accurate simulation of backscattering coefficient (sigma o) at the regional scale are essential for improving soil moisture retrieval based on active microwave remote sensing. This study investigates the potential of simulating the Sentinel-1A observations and constraining the coefficients of the water cloud model (WCM) at the regional scale based on a theoretical microwave scattering model named Tor Vergata model. The Tor Vergata discrete scattering model is firstly calibrated at both site-and regional-scale to find a single set of model parameters for capturing the Sentinel-1A observations at the regional scale. Sub-sequently, the coupled WCM and Oh model is calibrated at the regional scale based on three strategies, i.e., using either the calibrated Tor Vergata simulations or the Sentinel-1A observations, or with the assumption that the sigma o only comes from the vegetation contribution during the peak growth period. The investigation is conducted in a Tibetan meadow ecosystem configured with a long-term regional-scale soil moisture monitoring network. The results show the optimized parameter values obtained for the Tor Vergata model are consistent with each other based on both calibration methods, leading to comparable performances in simulating well the Sentinel-1A observations and scattering components. These results demonstrate the transferability of model parameters under similar land condition and the feasibility of simulating the regional-scale sigma o based on a single set of model parameters using the Tor Vergata model. The sigma o simulated by the coupled WCM and Oh model based on the three calibration strategies are comparable to each other and well agree with the calibrated Tor Vergata simulations as well as Sentinel-1A observations. However, the traditional calibration method using the Sentinel-1A observations tends to produce unreasonable WCM coefficients and thus unrealistic simulation of vegetation transmissivity. Above deficiencies are largely addressed by other two calibration strategies, whereby the first one preserves the physical mechanism of the Tor Vergata model and reduces the computation cost, and the assumption made by the other strategy may provide a new sight to solve the unknown WCM coefficients. These positive results warrant further investigation for developing new parameterization of WCM to improve soil moisture retrieval at the regional scale based on active microwave remote sensing.

AB In recent years, various techniques have been developed to generate crop-type maps based on remote sensing data. Wheat and barley are two major cereal crops cultivated as the first and fourth largest grain crops across the globe. The variations in spectral temporal profile of both crops are generally insignificant at small scales and therefore the two crops are phenologically fairly clearly separated; however, at large scale areas the variance of phenological parameters increases for both crops due to the effects of various climatic and orographic factors which adversely influences discrimination of wheat and barley. Additionally, wheat and barley are usually cultivated as both spring and winter or early and late season crops in some areas, making it more difficult to distinguish them. Therefore, developing a new method based on remote sensing data for effective discrimination of wheat and barley is an important necessity in the field of precision agriculture. To this end, this research presents a new phenology-based method to discriminate barley from wheat. In this study, Sentinel-2 (S2) time-series data of a study site in Iran (Markazi) and two sites in the USA (Idaho and North California), are employed. Spectral reflectance values of wheat and barley are examined during the growing season and a new spectral-temporal feature is successfully developed for automatic identification of the barley heading date. The Relief-f algorithm is then employed to select appropriate spectral features of S2 to distinguish wheat from barley at the heading date. Finally, generated spectral features at the heading date are used as input to Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) to produce barley and wheat maps. The Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy (OA) obtained for the three study sites are more than 0.67 and 76%, respectively. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of remote sensing data to identify the phenological growth stages of barley and distinguish it successfully from wheat.

AB Due to recent technological advancements in the field of cloud-based satellite remote sensing, the barriers to global analysis ready dataset access and processing have lowered drastically increasing the opportunity for large-scale long-term satellite-derived shoreline monitoring solutions. However, validation studies employing syn-chronous and independent in-situ instantaneous shorelines at scale are limited. Thanks to a unique dataset of 47 synchronous UAV photogrammetric surveys in 15 coastal locations in Victoria, Australia, over 3 years, we validated Sentinel-2 instantaneous subpixel shorelines extracted using the most common water indices, CoastSat and a tidal-balanced convolutional neural network (Unet+++). We assessed the accuracy of the water level estimation using 9 wave run-up models and wave data sourced from a nearshore wave buoy network, a regional hindcast model and a global altimeter wave dataset. This paper also presents the first validation of Deep Learning-derived shorelines using synchronous independent in-situ data. We found the best overall performance and least threshold-sensitive shoreline extraction approach to be the WI index, whilst NDWI had the poorest performances despite being the most utilized across the literature. We found that the thresholdless Unet+++ solution coupled with an ensemble wave run-up model and the altimeter wave data is an adequate trade-off in terms of accuracy, adaptability and wave data access for global scale shoreline studies.Moreover, we highlighted the very high spatial variability of beach-scale shoreline extraction performances and found that generally, the best SDS extractor only performs best along 30-40% of a coastline. Our results suggest that future satellite-derived shoreline approaches should investigate the relationships between scene -dependent variables and shoreline accuracies in order to better understand the causes of beach-scale perfor-mance variations and increase the accuracy of satellite-derived shorelines.

AB Over the past decade, spatiotemporal fusion has become an indispensable tool for monitoring land surface dy-namics due to its promising ability to produce surface reflectance products with both high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, existing fusion methods usually generate multispectral band products by predicting each spectral band separately, so the useful information of spectral autocorrelation within the spectrum has been ignored and waits to be exploited. To address this issue, we propose a novel spatiotemporal fusion method, the spatiotemporal Fusion Incorrporting Spectral autocorrelaTion (FIRST) model, to fully utilize the multiple spectral bands of surface reflectance products. Compared with other fusion methods, the model has three distinct ad-vantages: (1) it utilizes spectral autocorrelation in a many-to-many regression framework that simultaneously inputs and predicts multispectral bands without the collinearity effect; (2) it maintains high fusion accuracy when the spatiotemporal variation is large with acceptable computational efficiency; and (3) it can produce robust results even with input images contaminated by haze and thin clouds. We tested the FIRST model at several experimental sites and compared it with four typical methods, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) model, the regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation (Fit-FC) model and the enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM). The results demonstrate that FIRST yields better overall performance for its simple and effective technical principles. FIRST is thus expected to provide high-quality remotely sensed data with high spatial resolution and frequent observations for various applications.

AB Thermokarst lakes (TLs) widespread in thawing permafrost can degrade vegetation through thermomechanical erosion and waterlogging. However, whether TLs change water sources and alleviate water stress for plants is unknown, and previous knowledge about regional TL effects on surrounding vegetation greenness is rare. Here, we synthesized field investigations, stable isotopes, and remote sensing images from an unmanned aerial vehicle and Sentinel-2 to determine the effects of over 160,000 TLs on their surrounding growing-season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results are as follows: 1) With the largest water source shifting from 0 to 10 cm soil water to lake water, TL-affected plants can grow better than TL-unaffected plants, which is associated with soil texture and the development stage of the lake. 2) Overall, the median affecting distances of TLs on surrounding surface moisture (tasseled cap wetness, TCW) and NDVI were 50 m with their 25th-75th percentiles of 40-70 m and 40-60 m, respectively; compared with the unaffected areas, TLs increased peripheral TCW but reduced NDVI with their median change rates of 19.84% and -10.42%, respectively. 3) However, the nonlinear response of NDVI to the TCW gradient was dominant, which was featured by a local peak NDVI due to the coexistence of the physical destruction and improved water availability, and both TCW and NDVI at the peak area were explicitly larger than those at the unaffected area. 4) Along southeast-northwest environmental gradients (topographic, climatic, and edaphic factors), the affected range and degradation ratio of NDVI were greater under drier climate, larger lake area, sand-richer soil, fewer soil nutrients, and worse vegetation type (e.g., alpine desert). Briefly, the net adverse consequence on NDVI suggests that TLs primarily represent permafrost-supported ecosystems deteriorating, but the clear nonlinear effects advance the knowledge of this landscape; additionally, these local vegetation changes can help interpret the regional greening/browning and promote the research on the biogeochemical interaction among TL, soil, and plants under climate warming and permafrost thawing.

AB The estimation of particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations from satellite images can provide crucial spatiotemporal continuous observation data for the carbon cycle and ecological environmental governance. Here, we developed a novel inversion algorithm for deriving POC in inland water based on remote sensing and geochemical isotopes, which is summarized as follows. First, we developed empirical relationships between the phytoplankton absorption coefficient and endogenous POC concentration (CendPOC) and between the nonalgal particulate absorption coefficient and terrestrial POC concentration (CterPOC). Second, based on the valid re-lationships, semianalytical retrieval models were established to estimate CendPOC and CterPOC. Third, the pro-portions of endogenous POC (RendPOC) and terrestrial POC (RterPOC) to the total POC concentration (CPOC) were derived using a three-band empirical model. Finally, CPOC was obtained by dividing CendPOC by RendPOC (RendPOC & GE; 0.5) or dividing CterPOC by RterPOC (RendPOC < 0.5). Validation with field data shows that our proposed algo-rithm can accurately derive CPOC (0-20 mg/L), with a root mean square deviation (RMSD), median bias (MB), median absolute percent difference (MAPD), and median ratio (MR) of 1.15 mg/L,-0.05 mg/L, 24%, and 0.98, respectively. Synchronous validation based on Sentinel-3/OLCI images confirmed the accuracy, with RMSD, MB, MAPD, and MR values of 0.41 mg/L,-0.16 mg/L, 28%, and 0.91, respectively. The algorithm was applied to ocean and land color sensor (OLCI) images to reveal the temporal and spatial variations in POC in Lake Taihu.

AB Antarctic blue ice areas are exposed due to erosion and sublimation of snow. At the same time, surface melt can form surface types that are spectrally similar to blue ice, especially at low elevations. These are termed melt -induced blue ice areas. Both types of blue ice are sensitive indicators of climate change. Satellite remote sensing is a powerful technique to retrieve the spatial extent of blue ice areas and their variation in time. Yet, existing satellite-derived blue ice area products are either mono-temporal for the entire Antarctic ice sheet, or multi-temporal for a limited area. Here, we present FABIAN, a product of blue ice fraction over Antarctica, derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) archive covering the period 2000-2021. A spectral mixture analysis (SMA) in Google Earth Engine, based on a careful selection of end -member spectra, accurately reconstructs the reflectance observed by MODIS in blue ice areas. Based on a vali-dation with contemporaneous Sentinel-2 images, FABIAN has a root mean square error in blue ice fraction of approximately 10% -20% in wind-induced blue ice areas, and 20% -30% in melt-induced blue ice areas across six selected test sites in the coastal East Antarctic ice sheet. FABIAN is challenged in regions with shallow melt streams and lakes, since their spectral profiles are similar to those from blue ice areas in MODIS bands. For further analyses and applications, FABIAN holds the potential for (1) deriving annual blue ice area maps, (2) distinguishing between wind-and melt-induced blue ice types, (3) evaluating and correcting (regional) climate models, and (4) analyzing temporal variations in blue ice abundance and exposure.

AB In this study, a deep learning algorithm is developed to consistently retrieve the daytime and nighttime cloud properties from passive satellite observations without auxiliary atmospheric parameters. The algorithm involves the thermal infrared (TIR) radiances, viewing geometry, and altitude into a convolutional neural network (denoted as TIR-CNN), and retrieves the cloud mask, cloud optical thickness (COT), effective particle radius (CER), and cloud top height (CTH) simultaneously. The TIR-CNN model is trained using daytime Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products during a full year, and the results are validated and evaluated using passive and active products observed in independent years. The evaluation results show that the cloud properties retrieved by the TIR-CNN are well consistent with all available MODIS day-time products (cloud mask, COT, CER, and CTH) and night-time products (cloud mask and CTH). The retrieved COT and CTH also show good agreements with active sensors for both daytime and nighttime, indicating that the algorithm performs stably in the diurnal cycle.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter when monitoring land surface processes. However, cloud contamination and the tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions greatly impede the access to highquality thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data. Despite the massive efforts made to solve these dilemmas, it is still difficult to generate LST estimates with concurrent spatial completeness and a high spatio-temporal resolution. Land surface models (LSMs) can be used to simulate gapless LST with a high temporal resolution, but this usually comes with a low spatial resolution. In this paper, we present an integrated temperature fusion framework for satellite-observed and LSM-simulated LST data to map gapless LST at a 60-m spatial resolution and halfhourly temporal resolution. The global linear model (GloLM) model and the diurnal land surface temperature cycle (DTC) model are respectively performed as preprocessing steps for sensor and temporal normalization between the different LST data. The Landsat LST, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST, and Community Land Model Version 5.0 (CLM 5.0)-simulated LST are then fused using a filter-based spatiotemporal integrated fusion model. Evaluations were implemented in an urban-dominated region (the city of Wuhan in China) and a natural-dominated region (the Heihe River Basin in China), in terms of accuracy, spatial variability, and diurnal temporal dynamics. Results indicate that the fused LST under all-weather conditions is highly consistent with actual Landsat LST data (in situ LST measurements), in terms of a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.94 (0.96-0.99), a mean absolute error of 0.71-0.98 K (0.82-3.34 K), and a root-mean-square error of 0.97-1.26 K (1.09-4.36 K). The generated diurnal Landsat-like LSTs under all weather conditions are able to support diurnal dynamic studies that are the most relevant to human activities, such as the study of urban heat islands (UHIs) and water resource management at the field scale.

AB Near-surface air temperature (Ta) is one of the key variables in a variety of studies such as hydrological modeling, assessment of heat waves, and energy modeling. Among existing methods, statistical algorithms are suitable for integrating auxiliary spatial data with station-based Ta data to produce gridded Ta over large areas. However, existing statistical algorithms (e.g., Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)) cannot always correctly capture and preserve relationships between Ta and explanatory variables, which may increase un-certainties of relevant applications based on the estimated Ta with abnormal spatial patterns. This issue is mainly caused by the lack of enough observations due to the limited spatial coverage of weather stations, leading to abnormal relationships between Ta and explanatory variables. In order to address this issue, in this study, we introduced a new method named the Spatially Varying Coefficient Models with Sign Preservation (SVCM-SP) to estimate gridded Ta using gridded land surface temperature (LST) and elevation as explanatory variables with presetting positive and negative signs for coefficients, respectively. Using this method, first, we calculated the preset parameters of the bivariate spline surface. Second, we used the input data at weather stations and con-strained least squares regression to obtain the coefficient surface for both the explanatory variables (i.e., elevation and LST) and the intercept. Third, we calculated the gridded Ta using the 1 km gridded LST and elevation data, and the estimated spatially varying coefficient surfaces. We evaluated the model performance for estimating 1 km gridded daily maximum and minimum Ta (i.e., Tmax and Tmin) data in mainland China from 2003 to 2016 using 10-fold cross-validation and compared its performance with the GWR model. The average root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) based on the SVCM-SP are 1.75 C and 1.22 C for Tmax, and 1.82 C and 1.30 C for Tmin, respectively. The SVCM-SP method showed better performance than the GWR in terms of accuracy, computing efficiency, and has more interpretable coefficients for explanatory variables to get more realistic spatial pattern of gridded Ta. More important, the sign preservation of the SVCM-SP method can mitigate the issue of abnormal relationships between Ta and explanatory variables in the traditional methods such as GWR, and therefore will contribute to future studies in developing better gridded air temperature or relevant data products.

AB Clouds constitute a key component of weather and climate systems, whereas the uniform retrieval of cloud properties, such as cloud top height (CTH) and cloud optical thickness (COT), requires accuracy and computational efficiency improvements. In this study, an image-based deep neural network (DNN) model for cloud identification and simultaneous retrieval of CTH and ice-COT is developed for Himawari-8 satellite infrared measurements. The DNN model is trained with brightness temperature data from four months in 2016 as the input, and cloud properties of an active remote sensing product from CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) as the target truth. Supplementary variables, including the vertical temperature profile, the surface elevation, and the geometrical parameters, are added as the input data. DNN model performance is first tested with an independent dataset, and then cases over a CloudSat track and a Himawari-8 granule (85?E-205?E, 60?S-60?N) are selected for further validation of the model by comparing its results with those from two physics-based models. For both the water-and ice-CTH estimates, the DNN model shows high consistency with the target values, with an overall CTH correlation coefficient of 0.90 for high ice clouds with COT >= 0.3. Notably, as an infrared method in nature, the DNN extends the predictable ice-COT to similar to 200, with relative biases of similar to 20% for high ice clouds with COT > 1. The strong accuracy of the DNN model is primarily derived from its ability to learn from the spatial features imprinted on the input brightness temperature image, and its integration of information from neighboring pixels in a three-dimensional space. A single full disk estimation with the DNN model takes about 20 min using one processor; therefore, near-real-time cloud property retrieval that is uniformly available over 24 h can be obtained for severe weather monitoring and mesoscale cloud-system studies.

AB Sediment-laden sea ice is a ubiquitous phenomenon in the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas. This study presents a satellite-based approach at quantifying the distribution of sediment-laden ice that allows for more extensive observations in both time and space to monitor spatiotemporal variations in sediment-laden ice. A structural-optical model coupled with a four-stream multilayer discrete ordinates method radiative transfer model was used to examine surface spectral albedo for four surface types: clean ice, sediment-laden ice with 15 different sediment loadings from 25 to 1000 g m(-3), ponded ice, and ice-free open water. Based on the fact that the spectral characteristics of sediment-laden ice differ from those other surface types, fractions of sediment-laden ice were estimated from the remotely-sensed surface reflectance by a spectral unmixing algorithm using a least square method. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that a combination of sediment loads of 50 and 500 g m(-3) effectively represents the areal fraction of sediment-laden ice with a wide range of sediment loads. The estimated fractions of each surface type and corresponding remotely-sensed surface reflectances were used to train an artificial neural network to speed up processing relative to the least squares method. Comparing the fractions of sediment-laden ice derived from these two approaches yielded good agreements for areal fractions of sediment-laden ice, highlighting the superior performance of the neural network for processing large datasets. Although our approach contains potential uncertainties associated with methodological limitations, spatiotemporal variations in sediment-laden ice exhibited reasonable agreement with spatial patterns and seasonal variations reported in the literature on in situ observations of sediment-laden ice. Systematic satellite-based monitoring of sediment-laden ice distribution can provide extensive, sustained, and cost-effective observations to foster our under-standing of the role of sediment-laden ice in a wide variety of research fields including sediment transport and biogeochemical cycling.

AB The triple collocation (or three-way error) analysis is a widely used approach to infer the random uncertainty of three datasets measuring the same geophysical variable. It has been applied primarily for studying the quality of satellite observations for several variables, including sea surface temperature (SST) among others. Different algorithms have been developed in the literature to calculate the random uncertainties with sometimes distinct assumptions of the underlying error model or different equations. Four of the available triple collocation (TC) algorithms have been examined here in order to clarify the assumptions behind them and investigate their mathematical equivalence. In addition, triple collocations of SST observations from drifting buoys, and satellite observations from the ATSRs and microwave (MW) imagers have been used to examine the divergence among the TC algorithms with real data. It has been found that the maximum absolute difference is less than 0.009 K for the data considered here, indicating that the choice of TC algorithm is not significant to first order. This result permitted the investigation of the impact of the number of collocations by performing statistical experiments with real observations selecting them randomly without replacement. It is established that the ideal number is at least 500. Numbers below 200 on average would underestimate the true value of random uncertainties, while for numbers of about 100 or below numerical instabilities appear preventing the convergence to a solution with this issue becoming more acute as the number becomes smaller. For the SST instruments considered, the dependence of the random uncertainty on the sample number is described adequately by a theoretical equation given by Zwieback et al. (2012). This theoretical equation has been used to study the robustness of the differences in AMSR-E random uncertainties between day and night. The differences are mainly due to wind speed dependence, manifested also as latitudinal dependence. This is further confirmed when examining the variability of the random uncertainties with wind speed and SST. The AATSR random uncertainty slightly decreases linearly with wind speed, while AMSR-E increases by up to 50% between low and high wind speeds. A non-negligible dependence with SST has been found for both AATSR and drifting buoys with higher random uncertainty for SST in the range 10 degrees-15 degrees C. The AMSR-E random uncertainty decreases linearly with SST, when SST is above about 15 degrees C. Obviously, the dependence of the random uncertainty with the geophysical variable, here SST, violates one of the assumptions behind TC. Nevertheless, this can be mitigated through the application of TC into intervals of the geophysical variable for which the independence from the random uncertainty holds. These practical results unveil the real power of TC which based on the use of three collocated datasets is able to characterise their random uncertainties in a robust way, something extremely difficult to achieve by employing only two datasets without prior knowledge.

AB Satellite-based gross primary productivity (GPP) monitoring in croplands is challenging due to our limited ability to empirically constrain photosynthetic capacity and associated parameters. Here, we investigated if integrating land surface temperature (T-R)-based evapotranspiration (ET) or latent heat flux (lambda E) into a Remote sensing-driven approach to Coupling Ecosystem Evapotranspiration and Photosynthesis (RCEEP) model, which is modified from the underlying water use efficiency method, can better characterize GPP under dry conditions as compared to the light use efficiency (LUE)-based models. We developed the new GPP model, termed STIC-RCEEP, by combining an ET model, called STIC (Surface Temperature Initiated Closure), and RCEEP. We compared the performance of STIC-RCEEP against four conventional LUE-based models (Vegetation Photosynthesis Model, MOD17, STIC-MOD17, STIC-LUE), using tower-based daily GPP data from different cropland flux sites across the globe. An evaluation of the five GPP models, all optimized using available 170 site-years data from the 22 flux sites, revealed the relatively better performance of the STIC-RCEEP (R-2 = 0.78 and RMSE = 2.5 gC m(-2) d(-1)) with respect to the other four LUE models. Error analysis revealed substantially less error of STICRCEEP particularly under the dry conditions and RMSE of STIC-RCEEP was 9%-14% less than the other models. This finding highlights the enhanced ability of thermal sensors to capture the water stress signals in ET and GPP, which is also evidenced by the substantially better performance of STIC than another widely-regarded nonthermal ET model (the Priestly Taylor - Jet Propulsion Laboratory model), under dry conditions. The improved GPP estimates from STIC-RCEEP under water-stressed environment opens avenues for further research and applications using existing and new TR-based sensors in coupled crop water use-productivity modeling.

AB Research has demonstrated the utility of digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) for area-based predictions of forest inventory attributes. To date, studies have used DAP data acquired with a range of spatial resolutions and image overlaps. The systematic benchmarking of DAP acquisition parameters remains an outstanding research and operational gap for forest applications. While the impact of along-track overlap on point cloud metrics and areabased attribute estimates can be readily simulated, the impact of image resolution or across-track overlap requires purpose-acquired data. Moreover, although increases in along-track overlap are enabled by digital camera systems, costs for increasing across-track overlap can be substantial and may negate the cost-effectiveness of DAP for forest inventory. Hence, determining the impacts of varying acquisition parameters is of practical value for inventory programs. Researchers and practitioners have often assumed that more overlap will result in better DAP data, and that minimal overlaps often associated with historic airborne image campaigns are inadequate to support DAP processing. In our study, we found no marked difference among 15 and 20 cm spatial resolutions and overlap scenarios unless across-track overlap was reduced to 40%. Mean differences between DAP metrics and the ALS reference generally increased with decreasing overlap, and mean differences were larger for lower height percentiles (p10). Estimates of canopy height using the p90 metric varied by a root mean squared difference (RMSD) of approximately 5% between 15 cm and 20 cm datasets when along-track overlap was greater than 40%. Lower height percentiles were more strongly impacted by overlaps and resolution. Cover metrics varied by 2% RMSD across all overlap scenarios and resolutions. Comparisons between forest types (conifer, deciduous, mixed), terrain slope and aspect, and ALS-derived canopy cover were conducted to determine whether significant mean differences existed between DAP and the ALS reference. Although some significant differences were found by forest type and terrain variables, significant differences were most commonly associated with canopy cover. Based on the results reported herein, along and across-track overlaps >= 60% result in DAP metrics that were more similar to ALS. Increasing across-track overlap from 60% to 80% did not consistently improve the level of agreement between DAP metrics and ALS reference metrics. Conversely, DAP metrics generated using across-track overlaps <60% resulted in metrics with greater differences from the ALS reference, and a greater range of variability in DAP metric values. Image acquisitions for forest inventory must consider a broad range of factors and herein we have quantified that increasing along- or across-track overlap beyond 60% does not improve agreement with ALS area-based point cloud metrics commonly used to model forest inventory attributes. Likewise, overlap that is <60% does result in greater differences with ALS reference. Other applications beyond forest inventory may have different overlap requirements.

AB In recent years, massive blooms of pelagic Sargassum have occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico, and satellite imagery have been used operationally to monitor and track the blooms. However, limited by the coarse resolution and other confounding factors, there is often a data gap in nearshore waters, and the uncertainties in the estimated Sargassum abundance in offshore waters are also unclear. Higher-resolution satellite data may overcome these limitations, yet such a potential is hindered by the lack of reliable methods to accurately detect and quantify Sargassum in an automatic fashion. Here, we address this challenge by combining large quantities of high-resolution satellite data with deep learning. Specifically, data from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI, 10-20 m), Operational Land Imager (OLI, 30 m), WorldView-II (WV-2, 2 m), and PlanetScope/Dove (3 m) are used with a deep convolution neural network (DCNN) to extract Sargassum features and quantify Sargassum biomass density or areal coverage. By utilizing the U-net architecture and the pre-trained weights from the VGG16 model, the DCNN (i.e., the VGGUnet model) can extract Sargassum features while discarding other confusing features (waves, currents, phytoplankton blooms, clouds, cloud shadows, or striping noise). For Sargassum biomass estimated from OLI and MSI images, results indicate an accuracy of -92% and 90%, respectively, when evaluated using images from the same sensor. When Sargassum areal coverage is estimated from WV-2 and Dove images, there is an accuracy of -98% and 82%, respectively. When different sensors are cross-compared, OLI reveals -30% more Sargassum biomass than MODIS from 14 OLI images collected in the Caribbean Sea (path/row: 001/050) for their commonly viewed observable areas, and - 180% more Sargassum biomass than MSI (N = 15, path/row: 001/050); such differences appear systematic (R2 = 0.98 and 0.73, respectively). Compared to the quasi-simultaneous MSI, OLI, and MODIS images, Dove shows higher Sargassum coverage. Higher-resolution sensors tend to observe more Sargassum because they can detect smaller-scale features that are missed by the coarser-resolution sensors, although the difference varies with time and location. The morphological characteristics of Sargassum features from these high-resolution data are also reported to facilitate management actions. The findings here not only fill the knowledge gaps and coverage gaps from previous studies, but more importantly pave the road toward operational monitoring and tracking Sargassum features in nearshore waters.

AB This study aims to evaluate the spatial and spectral characteristics of dominant heat-inducing urban built-up surface materials (UBSM) in Kalaburagi, Karnataka State (India) using multi remote sensing datasets and field/lab instruments. A total of 16 UBSM were collected at different locations of the study area and spectra were generated using ASD Field spec 3 Spectro radiometer operated at VNIR and SWIR regions (0.35 mu m to 2.5 mu m). The collected spectra were then resampled with the spectral range of 0.3-2.5 mu m and used for classifying dimensionally reduced AVIRIS-NG (Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer - Next Generation) dataset through Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier for understanding spatial and spectral characteristics of heat inducing UBSM in the study area. The classification shows that concrete, basalt stones and asbestos are the dominant UBSM in the study area and its spectral reflectance are comparatively low in the VNIR and SWIR regions. The land surface temperature (LST) of the study area was retrieved from the Landsat-8 TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor), and compared with the ECOSTRESS (ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station) LST data product and Fluke Infrared thermometer measurements operated at LWIR (8-14 mu m). All these LST estimation and comparison processes were synchronized at the most possible manner (+/- 7 days). Additionally, emissivity of collected UBSM were determined using FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Radiometer) emissivity in the laboratory. The amalgamation of results shows that barren land (mostly basaltic), basalt stones and concrete surfaces cover dominantly the high LST region of the study area. The FTIR measurements reveal that, among 16 dominant UBSM, basalt stones had recorded high spectral radiance (0.0309 Wm(-1)mu m(-1)sr(-1)) and emissivity (0.98) followed by concrete (emissivity = 0.94). Whereas marble had the lowest spectral radiance (0.0246 Wm(-1)mu m(-1)sr(-1)) and emissivity (0.49). The results agree with the SWIR reflection spectra (where basalt stones, concrete and barren rocks shows lower reflectance) and principle of Wien's displacement law (where radiance spectra display series of peaks that corresponding to the temperature measurements). Besides proposing a newer methodology for understanding spatial and spectral distribution of dominant heat inducing urban builtup surface materials, the results offer baseline data for studying microclimatic variations in the study area.

AB The vertical distribution of subsurface phytoplankton in the ocean contains key information about not only ocean ecology but also water column optical properties relevant to remote sensing. The existing methods for measuring this vertical distribution are mainly field bio-optical and biogeochemical observations, which are time- and labor-intensive and do not provide sufficient spatial coverage. Passive satellite remote sensing provides global observations of phytoplankton but offers no information on subsurface vertical structure. In this study, we made the first quantitative measurements of vertical distribution of the subsurface phytoplankton layer (SPL) in the South China Sea (SCS) using airborne lidar. A total of five lidar flight experiments were conducted between 2017 and 2019 in the SCS, and approximately 2.5 terabytes of data were obtained. A hybrid retrieval method combining the Klett method for klidar and the perturbation method for beta pi was developed. The lidar-retrieved chlorophyll-a concentrations and in situ data show good agreement (R2 greater than 0.8). The mean absolute percentage error for the lidar-retrieved chlorophyll-a concentrations is less than 15%. SPLs were observed both in Sanya Bay and in the open sea near Lingshui city, Hainan Province, China. The SPLs were observed at depths between 50 and 70 m in the open sea near Lingshui city, and between 5 and 30 m in Sanya Bay. The SPL depths have spatiotemporal variability, and we analyzed the possible factors (monsoon, seafloor depth, and sea surface temperature) that influence this spatiotemporal variability. The results show that lidar technology has a great potential for wide-range and long-term monitoring of SPLs, and is a good complement for discrete in situ observations and passive satellite remote sensing.

AB Daily continuous evapotranspiration (ET) estimates of 1 km spatial resolution can benefit agricultural water resources management at regional scales. Thermal infrared remote sensing-derived land surface temperature (LST) is a critical variable for ET estimation using energy balance-based models. However, missing LST information under cloudy conditions remains a long-standing barrier for spatiotemporally continuous monitoring of daily ET at regional scales. In this study, LST data of 1 km spatial resolution at 11:00 local solar time under allweather conditions across the North China Plain (NCP) were first generated using a data fusion approach developed previously. Second, combined with the generated LST data, MODIS products, and meteorological forcing from the China Land Data Assimilation System, the Two-Source Energy Balance model (TSEB) and a temporal upscaling method were jointly used to estimate daily ET at 1 km spatial resolution across the NCP for a decade from 2008 to 2017. In particular, to better incorporate the impact of crop phenology on ET and improve the ET estimation, the fraction of greenness in TSEB was determined in terms of a leaf area index threshold during the crop growth period. Compared with observed instantaneous latent heat flux (LE) corrected for energy balance closure, the estimated LE reasonably captures inter- and intra-annual variations in LE measured at the Huailai, Daxing, Weishan, and Guantao flux towers, with R2 of 0.63-0.79. Estimated daily ET against in situ ET measurements with energy balance closure at the Huailai, Daxing, and Guantao sites showed good performance in terms of R2 greater than 0.70 and RMSE below 0.91 mm/d. These accuracies are comparable with published results, with our ET data set validated by many more observations than previous studies and featuring spatiotemporal continuity and high spatial resolution across the entire NCP for a decade. Furthermore, seasonal ET variations reflected by our product outperform two widely used global products in capturing water consumption characteristics in the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system. In terms of temporal trends, annual ET estimates across the NCP show a decreasing and then increasing trend over the past decade, which is attributed to the increased cropping intensity over the recent years reflected by an increase in leaf area index.

AB Estimation of Green Area Index (GAI) and fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fAPAR) from decametric satellites was investigated in this study using a large database of ground measurements over croplands. It covers six main crop types including rice, corn, wheat and barley, sunflower, soybean and other types of crops. Ground measurements were completed using either digital hemispherical cameras, LAI-2000 or AccuPAR devices over sites representative of a decametric pixel. Sites were spread over the globe and the data collected at several growth stages concurrently to the acquisition of Landsat-8 images. Several machine learning techniques were investigated to retrieve GAI and fAPAR from the Landsat-8 top of canopy reflectance values, either using empirical or simulated calibration databases and generic or crop-type specific algorithms.
   Results show that using the six Landsat-8 bands together provided the best estimates of GAI and fAPAR. Machine learning techniques trained over a dataset simulated by the PROSAIL model provided less accurate estimates of GAI and fAPAR as compared to machine learning techniques trained over the ground data collected and applied over a similar dataset (best-case scenario). All machine learning techniques performed similarly when calibrated on PROSAIL simulations. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) was the best performing machine learning technique as compared to artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine regression (SVM) and as compared to NDVI simple model when calibrated over the ground dataset in the best-case scenario. However, the performance of the GPR trained over ground data is notably degraded when applied to crop types excluded from the calibration (worst-case scenario), and models based on simulations performs similarly of even better. Furthermore, training the GPR over specific crop types was performing slightly better than training over all the crop types together if at least 100 well distributed data points were available in the training dataset. Similar conclusions were obtained for the other machine learning techniques, with crop specific empirical models providing slightly better performances with a few exceptions. Finally, GAI was estimated by GPR with a RMSE varying between 0.45 and 1.19 and fAPAR with RMSE varying between 0.07 and 0.15 depending on the crop type.

AB Generation of consistent multi-sensor datasets is critical to the assessment of long-term global changes using satellite-borne instruments. Recent research suggests, however, that a fundamental assumption in satellite ocean color data processing concerning the calibration of the long near infrared band (i.e., 865 nm for MODIS) may introduce sensor-specific biases in space and/or time, which may also contribute to cross-sensor inconsistency in the derived reflectance data products. As such, it is necessary to assess the calibration of this band across sensors - performed here for MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/SNPP using 'simultaneous same view' matchups (SSV; similar to simultaneous nadir overpass, but allowing for non-nadir measurements). Towards that end, we assess geometric, temporal, and spatial homogeneity metrics to identify SSVs, and develop a band-shifting approach applicable within standard satellite data processing routines to resolve expected spectral differences in the radiometry. We find top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data from VIIRS/SNPP long near infrared band to be approximately 3% higher than the corresponding MODIS/A data. With the expectation that cross-calibrating the NIRL should improve cross-sensor continuity of downstream geophysical products (e.g., chlorophyll-a), we reprocessed VIIRS data using updated calibration coefficients. While we noticed many minor improvements in cross-sensor continuity in such data products, large-scale geographic and temporal biases between these two datasets still remain. These discontinuities may be the result of disparate errors in polarization correction or atmospheric correction, both of which are modulated by radiant path geometry.

AB Mixed pixels exist widely in remotely sensed images. To obtain more reliable land cover information than traditional hard classification, spectral unmixing methods have been developed to estimate the composition of the mixed pixels, in terms of the proportions of land cover classes. The existing spectral unmixing methods usually require pure spectra (i.e., endmembers) of each land cover class. However, in areas dominated by mixed pixels (e.g., highly heterogeneous areas), it can be a great challenge to extract a large number of pure endmembers, especially for long time-series data. Meanwhile, intra-class spectral variation remains a long-standing issue in spectral unmixing. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal spectral unmixing (STSU) approach to address these issues. The proposed method extends spectral unmixing from the traditional spatial domain to the spatio-temporal domain. It exploits fully the multi-scale spatio-temporal information, by using temporally neighboring fine spatial resolution images to detect land cover changes and, further, extracts the proportion information of unchanged mixed pixels required for training. The STSU method is free of the need for endmember extraction, using directly the extracted mixed training samples to construct a learning model, and it accounts for intra-class spectral variation. Therefore, it is a fully automatic method suitable for dynamic monitoring of land cover changes. The effectiveness of the STSU method was validated through experiments on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in five different areas. The proposed STSU method provides a new solution for spectral unmixing of time-series data based on the goal of continuous monitoring at the global scale.

AB Snow cover affects a diverse array of physical, ecological, and societal systems. As such, the development of optical remote sensing techniques to measure snow-covered area (SCA) has enabled progress in a wide variety of research domains. However, in many cases, the spatial and temporal resolutions of currently available remotely sensed SCA products are insufficient to capture SCA evolution at spatial and temporal resolutions relevant to the study of fine-scale spatially heterogeneous phenomena. We developed a convolutional neural network-based method to identify snow covered area using the similar to 3 m, 4-band PlanetScope optical satellite image dataset with similar to daily, near-global coverage. By comparing our model performance to snow extent derived from high-resolution airborne lidar differential depth measurements and satellite platforms in two North American sites (Sierra Nevada, CA, USA and Rocky Mountains, CO, USA), we show that these emerging image archives have great potential to accurately observe snow-covered area at high spatial and temporal resolutions despite limited radiometric bandwidth and band placement. We achieve average snow classification F-Scores of 0.73 in our training basin and 0.67 in a climatically-distinct out-of-sample basin, suggesting opportunities for model transferability. We also evaluate the performance of these data in forested regions, suggesting avenues for further research. The unparalleled spatial and temporal coverage of CubeSat imagery offers an excellent opportunity for satellite remote sensing of snow, with real implications for ecological and water resource applications.

TI ACIX-Aqua: A global assessment of atmospheric correction methods for
   Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 over lakes, rivers, and coastal waters
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Atmospheric correction over inland and coastal waters is one of the major remaining challenges in aquatic remote sensing, often hindering the quantitative retrieval of biogeochemical variables and analysis of their spatial and temporal variability within aquatic environments. The Atmospheric Correction Intercomparison Exercise (ACIX-Aqua), a joint NASA - ESA activity, was initiated to enable a thorough evaluation of eight state-of-the-art atmospheric correction (AC) processors available for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data processing. Over 1000 radiometric matchups from both freshwaters (rivers, lakes, reservoirs) and coastal waters were utilized to examine the quality of derived aquatic reflectances ((rho) over cap (w)). This dataset originated from two sources: Data gathered from the international scientific community (henceforth called Community Validation Database, CVD), which captured predominantly inland water observations, and the Ocean Color component of AERONET measurements (AERONET-OC), representing primarily coastal ocean environments. This volume of data permitted the evaluation of the AC processors individually (using all the matchups) and comparatively (across seven different Optical Water Types, OWTs) using common matchups. We found that the performance of the AC processors differed for CVD and AERONET-OC matchups, likely reflecting inherent variability in aquatic and atmospheric properties between the two datasets. For the former, the median errors in (rho) over cap (w)(560) and (rho) over cap (w)(664) were found to range from 20 to 30% for best-performing processors. Using the AERONET-OC matchups, our performance assessments showed that median errors within the 15-30% range in these spectral bands may be achieved. The largest uncertainties were associated with the blue bands (25 to 60%) for best-performing processors considering both CVD and AERONET-OC assessments. We further assessed uncertainty propagation to the downstream products such as near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). Using satellite matchups from the CVD along with in situ Chla and TSS, we found that 20-30% uncertainties in (rho) over cap (w)(490 <= lambda <= 743 nm) yielded 25-70% uncertainties in derived Chla and TSS products for top-performing AC processors. We summarize our results using performance matrices guiding the satellite user community through the OWT-specific relative performance of AC processors. Our analysis stresses the need for better representation of aerosols, particularly absorbing ones, and improvements in corrections for sky- (or sun-) glint and adjacency effects, in order to achieve higher quality downstream products in freshwater and coastal ecosystems.

AB We develop a methodology to derive a global medium resolution (250 m) land mask from several existing data sources. In particular, a number of improved land mask data sets have been developed from satellite measurements recently, though some artifacts and omissions still remain. We show how combining global land mask data from multiple independent data sources can decrease the frequency of artifacts, and improve the data consistency and quality. We use the ocean color product imagery derived from measurements of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) to evaluate and validate the new global land mask implemented in the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system, and demonstrate the improvements in the derived global ocean color data coverage. Results show that when using the new proposed land mask the accuracy of global ocean color data coverage is significantly improved over coastal and inland waters. The new land mask more accurately represents the current global land coverage status, providing more complete and consistent global land/water coverage data set for ocean color remote sensing and for various other satellite Earth observing applications.

AB During the last two decades, forest monitoring and inventory systems have moved from field surveys to remote sensing-based methods. These methods tend to focus on economically significant components of forests, thus leaving out many factors vital for forest biodiversity, such as the occurrence of species with low economical but high ecological values. Airborne hyperspectral imagery has shown significant potential for tree species classification, but the most common analysis methods, such as random forest and support vector machines, require manual feature engineering in order to utilize both spatial and spectral features, whereas deep learning methods are able to extract these features from the raw data.
   Our research focused on the classification of the major tree species Scots pine, Norway spruce and birch, together with an ecologically valuable keystone species, European aspen, which has a sparse and scattered occurrence in boreal forests. We compared the performance of three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) with the support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting machine and artificial neural network in individual tree species classification from hyperspectral data with high spatial and spectral resolution. We collected hyperspectral and LiDAR data along with extensive ground reference data measurements of tree species from the 83 km(2) study area located in the southern boreal zone in Finland. A LiDAR-derived canopy height model was used to match ground reference data to aerial imagery. The best performing 3D-CNN, utilizing 4 m image patches, was able to achieve an F1-score of 0.91 for aspen, an overall F1-score of 0.86 and an overall accuracy of 87%, while the lowest performing 3D-CNN utilizing 10 m image patches achieved an F1-score of 0.83 and an accuracy of 85%. In comparison, the support-vector machine achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 82.4% and the artificial neural network achieved an F1-score of 0.82 and an accuracy of 81.7%. Compared to the reference models, 3D-CNNs were more efficient in distinguishing coniferous species from each other, with a concurrent high accuracy for aspen classification.
   Deep neural networks, being black box models, hide the information about how they reach their decision. We used both occlusion and saliency maps to interpret our models. Finally, we used the best performing 3D-CNN to produce a wall-to-wall tree species map for the full study area that can later be used as a reference prediction in, for instance, tree species mapping from multispectral satellite images. The improved tree species classification demonstrated by our study can benefit both sustainable forestry and biodiversity conservation.

DT Article

ID SEA; MODEL
AB This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate the wind direction over the sea from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images without any external information. The method employs deep residual network (ResNet), a variant of Convolutional Neural Network, to obtain high resolution (2 km by 2 km) aliased wind direction fields. Forty-seven SAR images of the European Space Agency satellites Sentinel-1 have been processed with ResNet, previously trained with other fifteen images. The areas of interest are the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf, two regional seas where the SAR images often present complex patterns associated to the wind field spatial structure reporting traces of the interaction with coastal orography, hence valuable test sites to evaluate the performance of the methodology here proposed. Statistical analysis was carried out comparing the SAR-derived wind directions with those from ECMWF atmospheric model, ASCAT scatterometer and in-situ gauges. It reports biases beta of -1.1 degrees, 2.4 degrees and -4.6 degrees respectively, and centered root mean square difference cRMSd<21 degrees, consistent with the benchmark obtained comparing scatterometer with ECMWF wind directions over the areas imaged by SAR (beta 2.1 degrees, cRMSd=19 degrees). These results are relevant because they include the coastal data not accounted in the benchmark. Analysis of selected cases showed that SAR-derived wind fields reproduce meteorological situations characterized by strong divergence. Notably, our ResNet is able to estimate the wind direction even in the absence of wind streaks on the SAR images and in presence of convective turbulence structures, atmospheric lee waves, and ships. Furthermore, the model is also able to derive the wind field over small areas, as the example of Venice lagoon has shown. Detailed analysis of selected cases raised the issue of the lack of data with true spatial resolution of approximate to 2 km and within half hour from the satellite pass time necessary for exhaustive comparisons.

AB Understanding the reflectance anisotropy of forests and the underlying scattering mechanisms is needed to improve the accuracy of retrievals of fundamental forest characteristics from optical remote sensing data. In this paper, we developed a laboratory measurement set-up for a large goniometer (LAGOS) and measured multiangular spectra (350-2500 nm) of 18 small trees, composed of three common European tree species: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.). For all trees, we measured tree spectra in 47 view angles in the upper hemisphere. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting multi-angular reflectance spectra of single trees. We also measured the reflectance and transmittance spectra of needles and leaves, as well as reflectance spectra of bark of the sample trees. We analyzed the spectro-directional characteristics of the trees, and the inter- and intraspecific variations of these characteristics. The anisotropy of trees was shown to be strongly asymmetrical and characteristic to species: while pine and spruce exhibited strong hotspot effects, oak showed a strong specular component. Our results indicate that simultaneous measurements of both spectral and directional characteristics of trees may enhance the discrimination of species and thus, support the retrieval of information of their biophysical properties.

AB Remote sensing is a useful tool for observing the water cycle. However, combining remote sensing products over any major river basin will result in a residual error in the overall water balance. Previous studies have either quantified this error without correcting it, or have merged observations together with land surface models (LSMs) to produce a single "best" estimate of the water balance. Here, we present a new approach in which combinations of remote sensing and in situ observations are constrained to enforce water balance closure. Rather than a single estimate, this produces an ensemble of unique water balance estimates intended to characterize uncertainty and to avoid biases implicit in LSMs. We evaluate three techniques of varying complexity to enforce water balance closure for individual ensemble members over 24 global basins from Oct. 2002 Dec. 2014, resulting in as many as 60 realizations of the monthly water budget, contingent upon data availability. Compared with a published climate data record, the ensemble shows strong agreement for precipitation, evapotranspiration and changes in storage (R-2: 0.91-0.95), with less agreement for streamflow (R-2: 0.42-0.47), which may be indicative of LSM biases in the climate data record. Water balance residual errors resulting from combinations of raw products vary significantly (p < 0.001) with latitude, with a tendency for positive biases for lowand mid latitude basins, and negative biases elsewhere. Overall, residual errors are equivalent to 15% of total precipitation when averaged across all data products and basins. This study shows that closure constraints provide additional value outside of closing the water budget, including reduction of uncertainty and transfer of closure constraints in time to provide skillful estimates of mean annual basin discharge. We also showed that a simpler closure technique, proportional redistribution, performed better than more complex ones in decreasing uncertainty and for transfer through time to estimate basin discharge when a rigorous analysis of errors for each data product is not accounted for. This observation-based dataset is distinct from modeled estimates and therefore has the potential to preserve important information of anthropogenic effects on the water balance.

AB French Guiana forests cover 8 million hectares. With 98% of emerged land covered by forests, French Guiana is the area with the highest proportion of forest cover in the world. These forests are home to an exceptionally rich and diverse wealth of biodiversity that is both vulnerable and under threat due to high levels of pressure from human activity. As part of the French territory, French Guiana benefits from determined and continuous national efforts in the preservation of biodiversity and the environmental functionalities of ecosystems. The loss and fragmentation of forest cover caused by gold mining (legal and illegal), smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation, are considered as small-scale disturbances, although representing strong effects to vulnerable natural habitats, landscapes, and local populations. To monitor forest management programs and combat illegal deforestation and forest opening near-real time alerts system based on remote sensing data are required. For this large territory under frequent cloud cover, Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) data appear to be the best adapted. In this paper, a method for forest alerts in a near-real time context based on Sentinel-1 data over the whole of French Guiana (83,534 km2) was developed and evaluated. The assessment was conducted for 2 years between 2016 and 2018 and includes comparisons with reference data provided by French Guiana forest organizations and comparisons with the existing University of Maryland Global Land Analysis and Discovery Forest Alerts datasets based on Landsat data. The reference datasets include 1,867 plots covering 2,124.5 ha of gold mining, smallholder agriculture and forest exploitation. The validation results showed high user accuracies (96.2%) and producer accuracies (81.5%) for forest loss detection, with the latter much higher than for optical forest alerts (36.4%). The forest alerts maps were also compared in terms of detection timing, showing systematic temporal delays of up to one year in the optical method compared to the SAR method. These results highlight the benefits of SAR over optical imagery for forest alerts detection in French Guiana. Finally, the potential of the SAR method applied to tropical forests is discussed. The SAR-based map of this study is available on http://cesbiomass.net/.

AB Daily global burned area mapping of Earth from remotely sensed data is of considerable interest and indicates a clear user need, despite well-known accuracy limitations. Many studies report global and regional indicators of spatial and temporal accuracy to evaluate the quality of burned area products, but tend to rely on relatively sparse validation data. In this paper, an extensive validation data set covering 223 million ha over the Brazilian Cerrado for the 2015 fire season is used to thoroughly evaluate how the accuracy of burned area products relying on distinct spectral channels (SWIR+NIR versus NIR) and spatial resolution (250 m, 500 m, and both) depends on fire size.
   Toward this end, we consider publicly available burned area products MCD64A1 (v006) at 500 m and FireCCI51 at 250 m and use a recently proposed graph-based patch algorithm, which is flexible enough to combine 250-500 m bands.
   he trade-off between spatial resolution and spectral channels for the problem at hand reveals that better spatial resolution (NIR at 250 m) is preferable to a broader range of spectral channels (NIR + SWIR at 500 m) for small burns ( 250 ha), but that this relation is not preserved for large burns ( 1000 ha). Also, this study shows that combining both spectral indices into a single classifier leads to the most accurate burned area map. The analysis by land cover type indicates that overall accuracy is highest for grasslands and savannas, with grasslands benefiting the most from the use of SWIR bands. Results also indicate that burned areas can be classified with accuracy measured by the Dice Coefficient close to 80% for fire sizes larger than 500 ha, which corresponds to 60% of the total burned area, but accuracy lower than 36% for fire sizes smaller than 250 ha. In particular, our analysis suggests that the validation of burned area products always should be linked to the description of fire size distribution since it is a fundamental driver of accuracy.
   Results show that MODIS daily burned area mapping at 250-500 m spatial resolution can exhibit high temporal accuracy, with almost unbiased estimates and standard deviation close to 1.5 days, indicating an accurate characterization of the spread of large fires.

AB Paddy rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world, feeding over 50% of the global population. A quick and accurate mapping of the extent of paddy rice is of critical importance for ensuring food security, studying climate change and monitoring water resources. Based on Sentinel-1A data and rice flooding features, we proposed a rice mapping method called the Automated Rice Mapping using Synthetic Aperture Radar Flooding Signals (ARM-SARFS), in which the key "V" shaped feature in the Sentinel-1A VH backscatter time series rising from the flooding before and after rice transplanting was used for rice mapping. The ARM-SARFS was validated at three study sites in Hubei, Liaoning and Guangdong provinces in China under different rice cropping systems and different geographical and climate conditions. The results showed that even without any training samples, the ARM-SARFS was able to provide a satisfying classification result with an overall accuracy of over 86% and an F-1 score of over 0.85 at all three study sites. With the aid of training samples, the classification performance increased further. When compared with the previously proposed Sentinel-1-based rice mapping methods, the ARM-SARFS improved the overall accuracy by 13.3-37.2%, and the most significant improvement was in the producer's accuracy. The sensitivity test showed that the ARM-SARFS is not sensitive to thresholding, and a high classification accuracy can be achieved at thresholds ranging from -0.025 to 0. These results demonstrated the robustness of ARM-SARFS for automated rice mapping with a high accuracy at large scales.

AB Tropical forests are characterized by large carbon stocks and high biodiversity, but they are increasingly threatened by human activities. Since structure strongly influences the functioning and resilience of forest communities and ecosystems, it is important to quantify it at fine spatial scales.
   Here, we propose a new simulation-based approach, the "Canopy Constructor", with which we quantified forest structure and biomass at two tropical forest sites, one in French Guiana, the other in Gabon. In a first step, the Canopy Constructor combines field inventories and airborne lidar scans to create virtual 3D representations of forest canopies that best fit the data. From those, it infers the forests' structure, including crown packing densities and allometric scaling relationships between tree dimensions. In a second step, the results of the first step are extrapolated to create virtual tree inventories over the whole lidar-scanned area.
   Across the French Guiana and Gabon plots, we reconstructed empirical canopies with a mean absolute error of 3.98 m [95% credibility interval: 3.02, 4.98], or 14.4%, and a small upwards bias of 0.66 m [-0.41, 1.8], or 2.7%. Height-stem diameter allometries were inferred with more precision than crown-stem diameter allometries, with generally larger heights at the Amazonian than the African site, but similar crown-stem diameter allometries. Plot-based aboveground biomass was inferred to be larger in French Guiana with 400.8 t ha(-1) [366.2-437.9], compared to 302.2 t ha(-1) in Gabon [267.8-336.8] and decreased to 299.8 t ha(-1) [275.9-333.9] and 251.8 t ha(-1) [206.7-291.7] at the landscape scale, respectively. Predictive accuracy of the extrapolation procedure had an RMSE of 53.7 t ha(-1) (14.9%) at the 1 ha scale and 87.6 t ha(-1) (24.2%) at the 0.25 ha scale, with a bias of -17.1 t ha(-1) (-4.7%). This accuracy was similar to regression-based approaches, but the Canopy Constructor improved the representation of natural heterogeneity considerably, with its range of biomass estimates larger by 54% than regression-based estimates.
   The Canopy Constructor is a comprehensive inference procedure that provides fine-scale and individual-based reconstructions even in dense tropical forests. It may thus prove vital in the assessment and monitoring of those forests, and has the potential for a wider applicability, for example in the exploration of ecological and physiological relationships in space or the initialisation and calibration of forest growth models.

AB Radar data at C-band has shown great potential for the monitoring of soil and canopy hydric conditions of wheat crops. In this study, the C-band Sentinel-1 time series including the backscattering coefficients u(0) at VV and VH polarization, the polarization ratio (PR) and the interferometric coherence p are first analyzed with the support of experimental data gathered on three plots of irrigated winter wheat located in the Haouz plain in the center of Morocco covering five growing seasons. The results showed that p and PR are tightly related to the canopy development. p is also sensitive to soil preparation. By contrast, u(0) was found to be widely linked to changes in surface soil moisture (SSM) during the first growth stages when Leaf Area Index remains moderate (< 1.5 m(2)/m(2)). In addition, drastic changes in the crop geometry associated to heading had a strong impact on the C-band u(0), in particular for VH polarization. The coupled water cloud and Oh models (WCM) were then calibrated and validated on the study sites. The comparison between the predicted and observed u0 yielded a root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 1.50 dB to 2.02 dB for VV and between 1.74 dB to 2.52 dB for VH with significant differences occurring in the second part of the season after heading. Finally, new approaches based on the inversion of the WCM for SSM retrieval over wheat fields were proposed using Sentinel-1 radar data only. To this objective, the dry above-ground biomass (AGB) and the vegetation water content (VWC) were retrieved from the interferometric coherence and the PR. The relationships were then used as the vegetation descriptor in the WCM. The best retrieval results were obtained using the relationship between pVV and the AGB (R and RMSE of 0.82, 0.05 m3/m3 respectively and no bias). The new retrieval approaches were then applied to a large database covering a rainfed field in Morocco and 18 plots of rainfed and irrigated wheat of the Kairouan plain (Tunisia) and compared to other classical techniques of SSM retrieval including simple linear relationships between SSM and u0. The method based on the WCM and the pVV-AGB relationships also provided with slightly better results than the others on the validation database (r = 0.75, RMSE = 0.06 m(3)/m(3) and bias = 0.01 m(3)/m(3) over the 18 plots of Tunisia) but the simple linear relationships performed also reasonably well (r = 0.62, RMSE = 0.07, bias = -0.01 in Tunisia for instance). This study opens perspectives for high resolution soil moisture mapping from Sentinel-1 data over south Mediterranean wheat crops and in fine, for irrigation scheduling and retrieval through the assimilation of these new products in an evapotranspiration model.

AB Cloud cover is a common and inevitable phenomenon that often hinders the usability of optical remote sensing (RS) image data and further interferes with continuous cartography based on RS image interpretation. In the literature, the off-the-shelf cloud detection methods either require various hand-crafted features or utilize data -driven features using deep networks. Overall, deep networks achieve much better performance than traditional methods using hand-crafted features. However, the current deep networks used for cloud detection depend on massive pixel-level annotation labels, which require a great deal of manual annotation labor. To reduce the labor needed for annotating the pixel-level labels, this paper proposes a weakly supervised deep learning-based cloud detection (WDCD) method using block-level labels indicating only the presence or the absence of cloud in one RS image block. In the training phase, a new global convolutional pooling (GCP) operation is proposed to enhance the ability of the feature map to represent useful information (e.g., spatial variance). In the testing phase, the trained deep networks are modified to generate the cloud activation map (CAM) via the local pooling pruning (LPP) strategy, which prunes the local pooling layers of the deep networks that are trained in the training phase to improve the quality (e.g., spatial resolution) of CAM. One large RS image is cropped into multiple overlapping blocks by a sliding window, and then the CAM of each block is generated by the modified deep networks. Based on the correspondence between the image blocks and CAMs, multiple corresponding CAMs are collected to mosaic the CAM of the large image. By segmenting the CAM using a statistical threshold against a clear-sky surface, the pixel-level cloud mask of the testing image can be obtained. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed WDCD method, we collected a new global dataset, for which the training dataset contains over 200,000 RS image blocks with block-level labels from 622 large GaoFen-1 images from all over the world; the validation dataset contains 5 large GaoFen-1 images with pixel-level annotation labels, and the testing dataset contains 25 large GaoFen-1 and ZiYuan-3 images with pixel-level annotation labels. Even under the extremely weak supervision, our proposed WDCD method could achieve excellent cloud detection performance with an overall accuracy (OA) as high as 96.66%.

AB The history of Earth observation from space is well reflected through the Landsat program. With data collection beginning with Landsat-1 in 1972, the program has evolved technical capabilities while maintaining continuity of land observations. In so doing, Landsat has provided a critical reference for assessing long-term changes to Earth's land environment due to both natural and human forcing. Poised for launch in mid-2021, the joint NASA-USGS Landsat 9 mission will continue this important data record. In many respects Landsat 9 is a clone of Landsat-8. The Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) is largely identical to Landsat 8 OLI, providing calibrated imagery covering the solar reflected wavelengths. The Thermal Infrared Sensor-2 (TIRS-2) improves upon Landsat 8 TIRS, addressing known issues including stray light incursion and a malfunction of the instrument scene select mirror. In addition, Landsat 9 adds redundancy to TIRS-2, thus upgrading the instrument to a 5-year design life commensurate with other elements of the mission. Initial performance testing of OLI-2 and TIRS-2 indicate that the instruments are of excellent quality and expected to match or improve on Landsat 8 data quality. Landsat-9 will maintain the current data acquisition rate of up to 740 scenes per day, with these scenes available from the Landsat archive at no cost to users. In this communication, we provide background and rationale for the Landsat 9 mission, describe the instrument payloads and ground system, and discuss data products available from the Landsat 9 mission through USGS.

AB Satellite-observed night-time light in urban areas has been widely used as an indicator for socioeconomic development and light pollution. Up to present, the diurnal dynamics of city light during the night, which are important to understand the nature of human activity and the underlying variables explaining night-time brightness, have hardly been investigated by remote sensing techniques due to limitation of the revisit time and spatial resolution of available satellites. In this study, we employed a consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to monitor city light in a study area located in Wuhan City, China, from 8:08 PM, April 15, 2019 to 5:08 AM, April 16, 2019, with an hourly temporal resolution. By using three ground-based Sky Quality Meters (SQMs), we found that the UAV-recorded light brightness was consistent with the ground luminous intensity measured by the SQMs in both the spatial (R-2 = 0.72) and temporal dimensions (R-2 > 0.94), and that the average city light brightness was consistent with the sky brightness in the temporal dimension (R-2 = 0.98), indicating that UAV images can reliably monitor the city's night-time brightness. The temporal analysis showed that different locations had different patterns of temporal changes in their night-time brightness, implying that inter-calibration of two kinds of satellite images with different overpass times would be a challenge. Combining an urban function map of 18 classes and the hourly UAV images, we found that urban functions differed in their temporal light dynamics. For example, the outdoor sports field lost 97.28% of its measured brightness between 8: 08 PM - 4:05 AM, while an administrative building only lost 4.56%, and the entire study area lost 61.86% of its total brightness. Within our study area, the period between 9:06 PM and 10:05 PM was the period with largest amount of light loss. The spectral analysis we conducted showed that city light colors were different in some urban functions, with the major road being the reddest region at 8:08 PM and becoming even redder at 4:05 AM. This preliminary study indicates that UAVs are a good tool to investigate city light at night, and that city light is very complex in both of the temporal and spatial dimensions, requiring comprehensive investigation using more advanced UAV techniques, and emphasizing the need for geostationary platforms for night-time light sensors.

AB Mediterranean-climate oak woodlands are prized for their biodiversity, aesthetics, and ecosystem services. Conservation and maintenance of these landscapes requires accurate observations of both present and historic conditions capable of spanning millions of hectares. Decameter optical satellite image time series have the observational coverage to meet this need, with almost 40 years of intercalibrated global observations from the Landsat program alone. However, the optimal approach to leverage these observations for oak ecosystem monitoring remains elusive. Temporal mixture models (TMMs) may offer a solution. TMMs use a linear inverse model based on temporal endmembers (tEMs) chosen to optimize both parsimony and information content by 1) possessing clear biophysical meaning, and 2) accurately representing the variance structure of the observations in the temporal feature space (TFS) composed of low-order Principal Components. We apply this approach to oak woodlands of the California Sierra Nevada foothills. Low-order TFS structure across the approximate to 1200 km(2) study area is consistently bounded by 4 tEM phenologies: annual grasses, evergreen perennials, deciduous perennials + shadow, and unvegetated areas. Satellite-based tEM phenologies correspond to ground-based PhenoCam time series (correlations 0.8 to 0.9). Systematic temporal decimation is conducted to simulate years with varying numbers of cloud free measurements. Fractional cover of temporal endmembers is observed to scale linearly using as few as 6 images per year and coarse feature space topology is retained with as few as 4 well-timed images per year. In comparing 10 m versus 30 m pixel resolution, linear scaling is observed with correlations of 0.78-0.95. Comparison of 10 m Sentinel-2 and LiDAR-derived tree cover estimates at San Joaquin Experimental Range shows a correlation of 0.74. Visual orthophoto validation shows accuracies of annual, deciduous, and evergreen cover fractions of 74-88% (n = 102). Multi-year analysis of August imagery at Sequoia National Park to investigate dynamics associated with the 2012-2016 drought reveals 5 tEMs corresponding to: steady growth, steady decline, early decline then regrowth, persistent vegetation, and no vegetation. Validation images are sparse, but where available show accuracies in the 88 to 91% range for decrease, growth, and persistently vegetated multiyear endmembers (n = 102). Decreases are observed in areas with oak mortality documented in a recent field-based study. Overall, our results suggest the TMM approach has promise as an accurate, explainable, and linearly scalable method for retrospective analysis and prospective monitoring of Mediterranean-climate oak landscapes.

AB The potential of time series metrics based on optical sensors for monitoring of crops and their phenological stages has long been recognized. SAR (synthetic aperture radar) sensors such as Sentinel-1 can provide dense time series, but their potential for retrieving time series metrics is to date underexplored. The backscatter coefficient in VH (vertical-horizontal) and VV (vertical-vertical) polarization as well as the interferometric coherence of Sentinel-1 was retrieved in a German agricultural area in order to obtain a time series with a temporal resolution of 6 days. The backscatter coefficient ratio of VH and VV polarization was also calculated. Local extrema and breakpoints were detected in the locally smoothed time series data in wheat fields for the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. Breakpoints in the VH/VV ratio time series have high potential for detecting the date of shooting and harvesting of the studied wheat fields. The root mean squared differences between detected date and in situ observed date were 4.6 days in 2017, 5.3 days in 2018 and 9.5 days in 2019 for the shooting and 5.1 days in 2017, 8.2 days in 2018 and 10.4 days in 2019 for the harvest. Ripeness stages could not be detected with a high degree of accuracy. The results suggest that the VH/VV ratio has a high potential for monitoring the phenological stages of wheat fields, which can be used for large-scale crop productivity monitoring and risk assessment in agricultural cropping systems.

AB Altimeters can provide global long-duration observations of oceanic wind speed and wave height. However, altimeters face an undersampling problem in estimating wind and wave climate because of their sparse sampling pattern and the changing number of in-orbit satellites. In this study, the undersampling error of altimeters was studied by sampling the oceanic wind speed and wave height data from the ERA5 and the Integrated Ocean Waves for Geophysical and other Applications datasets using the track information of multiplatform altimeters. Comparisons were made between the statistics (mean, 90th and 99th percentiles, and long-term trends of them) of the original reanalysis/hindcast data and the gridded along-track sampling of the reanalysis/hindcast data. The results show a large discrepancy with respect to the extreme values (90th and 99th percentiles). The undersampling of altimeters can lead to significant underestimations of monthly extreme values of oceanic wind speed and wave height. Meanwhile, this underestimation is alleviated with the increase of the number of in-orbit altimeters, leading to very large overestimations of long-term trends of these extreme values over the period 1985-2018. In contrast, the annual extreme values of oceanic wind speed and wave height and their long-term trends are more reliable, although slight aforementioned biases of extreme values still exist and the data from GEOSAT are not suitable for computing annual statistics. For altimeter data, the annual values are a better option to compute long-term trends than the monthly data. This study also presents a correction scheme of using model data to compensate for the wind and wave events missed by altimeter tracks. After the correction, the global trends in oceanic wind speed and wave height over 1992-2017 are recomputed using annual statistics. The results show a clear discrepancy between the trends of wind speed and wave height during this period: the wind speed increased, while the wave height decreased. However, uncertainty still exists in the results and the reason for this discrepancy is unknown at this stage.

AB Tree mortality from major disturbances can greatly increase dead wood in forested areas, affecting fire intensity and behavior, wildlife habitat, and carbon dynamics. Accurately quantifying regional standing dead tree (SDT) pools, as conducted by the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, remains a prominent challenge. Little empirical work has been done accounting for structural changes in SDT volume across decay classes due to measurement and sampling challenges associated with SDT. Light-detection-and-ranging (LiDAR) represents a remote sensing technology with the potential to improve sampling efficacy and provide volume estimates of SDT via non-destructive sampling. Following this, the goal of this study was to explore the feasibility of empirically quantifying and assessing structural volume in southern pine SDT by decay class using terrestrial LiDAR. To meet this goal, we addressed three objectives, 1) construct empirical volume estimates of SDT by decay class using terrestrial LiDAR and a voxel-based, volume calculation algorithm capable of accounting for occlusion and point cloud quality, 2) develop allometric relationships of aboveground SDT component volumes by decay class and assess error in models and predictions, and 3) quantify proportion-remaining volume of SDT components from terrestrial LiDAR-derived volumes relative to predicted intact tree volumes. This study represents the first to develop empirically-based, terrestrial LiDAR-derived allometric volume relationships and proportion-remaining volume of SDT by decay class. Results indicate that terrestrial LiDAR-derived volumes of SDT produced robust allometric equations by decay class for total above-stump and stem-plus-bark components (adjusted R-2 = 0.94-0.98). Allometric relationships for tops-and-branches comprised more variability, likely impacted by scan quality, having adjusted R-2 values of similar to 0.52-0.59. Notably, the inclusion of height in allometric relationships for total above-stump volume precluded the need for decay class as a covariate, accounting for the variability inherent in each decay class. Importantly, this means that total above-stump allometric equations could be effective under different decay class systems or, more broadly, where no decay classes were measured, thus providing broad utility. Empirically-derived proportion-remaining volume of SDT components followed expected decreasing trends by decay class. Interestingly, proportion-remaining volume for tops-and-branches closely matched theoretically-derived values from a previous FIA-related study. Ultimately, terrestrial LiDAR was critical for efficiently measuring volume of southern pine SDT by decay class and for developing SDT-specific allometric relationships of volume and estimates of structural change by decay class. This study showcases the feasibility of LiDAR-derived, SDT-specific tools for improved accounting of SDT resources in FIA and other inventories.

AB Building height is one of the key variables in studying anthropogenic activities and built environments in the urban system. However, the information of urban building height over large areas is still limited due to the lack of available data. In this study, we developed an approach to estimate building height using the Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected data. First, we proposed an indicator of VVH that integrates the dual-polarization information (i.e., VV and VH) from the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data. Second, we developed a building height model using the indicator of VVH and the reference building height from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) images in seven cities in the United States (US). Third, we estimated building height of major cities with area larger than 500 km(2) in the US using the developed model. The root mean square error between estimated and reference height is 1.5 m in seven study cities in the US. The comparison with the Laser observations from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite data in available footprints also indicates that the estimated building height from Sentinel-1 data is reliable. The estimated building height from Sentinel-1 data shows a better agreement with the reference data compared to the Advanced Land Observing Satellite data in seven US cities. Our results of building height in major US cities indicate that there are more cities with tall buildings in the Northeastern US compared to the Western and Southern US, with more aggregated tall buildings in central business districts of cities. The information of building height from this study is of great value in urban studies, such as estimating energy consumption and carbon emissions in urban areas.

AB The seasonal snow cover contributes significantly to the water resource in the Indian Himalayas, and snow density is one of the vital parameters in the determination of the hydrological potential of snow. The application of conventional methods for snow density retrieval using fully polarimetric SAR data is constrained by the properties of snow primarily due to the melt and frost cycles, as compared to fresh dry snow. The surface component of backscatter is significant in case of melt and frost. In the conventional decomposition based methods, the surface component is not considered for the inversion of permittivity, as proposed in this study. In this paper, we also propose a methodology for the estimation of snow density using bi-temporal fully polarimetric C-band RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. We utilize the relation between the differential modified Mueller matrix components, the attenuation constants, and the Fresnel transmission coefficients. The permittivity of snow is derived using the inversion of the Fresnel transmission coefficients which is used to determine the snow density using a state of the art empirical relation. The snow density estimates from the proposed method are compared with other methods based on coherency matrix decomposition and evaluated against in-situ measurements collected during a field campaign carried out in Dhundi in the state of Himachal Pradesh in India. The snow density estimates using the proposed method are observed to correlate with the in-situ measurements and were also found to be better than the decomposition based methods.

AB Human-mediated climate change over the past century has resulted in significant impacts to global ecosystems and biodiversity including accelerating redistribution of the geographic ranges of species. In mountainous regions, the transition zone from continuous closed-canopy montane forests to treeless alpine tundra areas at higher elevations is commonly referred to as the "alpine treeline ecotone" (ATE). Globally, warming climate is expected to drive ATEs upslope, which could lead to negative impacts on local biodiversity and changes in ecosystem function. However, existing studies rely primarily on field-based data which are difficult and time consuming to collect. In this study, we define an ATE-detection index (ATEI) to automatically identify the ATE positions from 2009 to 2011 in the western United States using geospatial tools and remotely sensed datasets provided by Google Earth Engine. A binomial logistic regression model was fitted between standardized ATEI components and a binary variable of pixel status of 141 sampled Landsat pixels manually classified with high-resolution imagery in Google Earth. The average model accuracy was around 0.713 (+/- 0.111) and the average Kappa coefficient was approximately 0.426 (+/- 0.221) based on a 100-time repeated 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, the ATEI-estimated elevation is highly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.98) with a published set of field-collected ATE elevations at 22 sampling sites across the region. The detection metric developed in this study facilitates monitoring the geographic location and potential shifts of ATEs as well as the general impact of climate change in mountainous areas during recent decades. We also expect this approach to be useful in monitoring other ecosystem boundaries.

AB Remote sensing assessments of land use and land cover change (LULCC) are critical to improve understanding of socio-economic, institutional and ecological processes that lead to and stem from land use change. This is particularly crucial in the emerging frontiers of Southern Africa, where there is a paucity of LULCC studies relative to the humid tropics. This study focuses on Gurue District (5606 km2) of Zambezia province of Mozambique, one of many countries in the region that has experienced a recent growth in foreign investments in agriculture through large-scale land acquisitions, often resulting in land use conversions and modifications. Previous LULCC assessments covering Mozambique have focused on dynamics between natural and anthropogenic land categories, with limited efforts to distinguish the different land use agents associated with these changes, and relating this with social, economic and technological processes. In this study we built a new LULC assessment methodology that leverages the power of open remote sensing data and tools to integrate categorical and continuous training and validation data obtained from field surveys and Collect Earth software within Google Earth Engine. We then examined the suitability of five pixel-based compositing techniques for generating cloud-free Landsat images that can support analysis of land use dynamics in persistently cloudy, mosaic landscapes with more limited Landsat archives. Drawing upon the spectral and textural features of Landsat data in pixel-based composites, we classified land use over three time periods, 2006, 2012 and 2016, and characterized land use change, focusing on changes between small-scale cropland, large-scale mechanized cropland, and other land uses. This method can be upscaled and applied in many parts of Africa with similar historic image availability challenges, and similar economic contexts with great disparities between small-scale unmechanized cropland and very large-scale mechanized cropland, to explore land consolidation dynamics and agent-specific pathways of land use change.

AB A combined snow modelling approach integrating remote sensing data, in-situ data, and an improved hydrological model is presented. Complementary information sources are evaluated in terms of its value for constraining the model parameters and to overcome limitations of individual data such as inadequate scale representation. The study site consists of the Upper Fagge river basin in the Austrian Alps featuring the Weisssee Snow Research Site. The available remote sensing datasets include Terra MODIS based medium resolution and Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2A based high resolution fractional snow covered area maps. Recently, Sentinel-1 based wet snow covered area maps have become increasingly available. To the knowledge of the authors the first evaluation of their value for snow-hydrological modelling is presented. Besides conventional small footprint station data, in-situ time-series of snow water equivalent (SWE) of a Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) having a footprint of several hectares is additionally used. For including these data the model now provides respective outputs such as fractional snow cover, wet/dry snow surface and SWE areal means equivalent to the CRNS sensor footprint. By means of 40,000 model runs the high complementary value of representative SWE data and remote sensing information was assessed with most promising results achieved by combining high resolution fractional snow covered area maps with CRNS-SWE data. Regarding mean SWE or mean snow covered area in the catchment the ensemble spreads are reduced by two thirds compared to the results of a benchmark simulation based only on runoff for model calibration. Wet snow covered area maps have a high potential for simulating SWE at Weisssee Snow Research Site but introduce additional uncertainties for runoff simulations likely caused by the uncertain detection of the snow covered area from Sentinel-1 backscatter. The approach has high potential for water resources management in gauged and ungauged mountain basin and gives guidance for efficient data assimilation schemes.

AB The retrieval of canopy and soil component temperatures for estimating evapotranspiration in the two source energy balance (TSEB) model depends on a relatively accurate partitioning of soil/substrate evaporation and canopy transpiration along with the soil and vegetation temperature components. To avoid the need for a Priestley-Taylor based transpiration formulation, this study applies the TSEB model using radiometric land surface temperature observations at multiple view angles from an airborne sensor for estimating soil and canopy temperatures directly. This direct partitioning between soil and canopy temperatures applied with the TSEB formulation improved the agreement between observed and modeled surface heat fluxes, reducing mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in latent heat fluxes (LE) with flux tower observations from nearly 20% using the original Priestley-Taylor based TSEB model (TSEB-PT) to 15% using TSEB with thermal infrared observations from two substantially different view angles (TSEB-2AG) to nearly 5% using multiple (similar to 6) view angles (TSEB-6AG). Moreover, TSEB-6AG is shown to compute physically realistic spatially-distributed LE for a range of vegetation cover and environmental conditions over the imaged domain. Values of MAPE for sensible heat (H) tended to be larger for all three models due to the fact that tower measurements tended to be located in well irrigated and densely vegetated sites having relatively low H values. This increased accuracy of soil and vegetation component temperature separation using multiangle radiometric temperature observations is useful for evaluating the utility of single and dual view angle thermal radiometer measurements currently available for applying the TSEB model.

AB Ongoing increase in human and climate pressures, in addition to the lack of monitoring initiatives, makes the Caatinga one of the most vulnerable forests in the world. The Caatinga is located in the semi-arid region of Brazil and its vegetation phenology is highly dependent on precipitation, which has a high spatial and temporal variability. Under these circumstances, satellite image-based methods are valued due to their ability to uncover human-induced changes from climate effects on land cover. In this study, a time series stack of 670 Landsat images over a period of 31 years (1985-2015) was used to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of landcover clearing (LCC) due to vegetation removal in an area of the Caatinga. We compared the LCC detection accuracy of three spectral indices, i.e., the surface albedo (SA), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We applied a residual trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND) to attenuate seasonal climate effects on the vegetation time series signal and to detect only significant structural changes (breakpoints) from monthly Landsat time series. Our results show that SA was able to identify the general occurrence of LCC and the year that it occurred with a higher accuracy (89 and 62%, respectively) compared to EVI (44 and 22%) and NDVI (46 and 22%). The overall outcome of the study shows the benefits of using Landsat time series and a spectral index that incorporates the short-wave infrared range, such as the SA, compared to visible and near-infrared vegetation indices for monitoring LCC in seasonally dry forests such as the Caatinga.

AB Tidal flats (non-vegetated area), along with coastal vegetation area, constitute the coastal wetlands (intertidal zone) between high and low water lines, and play an important role in wildlife, biodiversity and biogeochemical cycles. However, accurate annual maps of coastal tidal flats over the last few decades are unavailable and their spatio-temporal changes in China are unknown. In this study, we analyzed all the available Landsat TM/ETM +/OLI imagery (-44,528 images) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform and a robust decision tree algorithm to generate annual frequency maps of open surface water body and vegetation to produce annual maps of coastal tidal flats in eastern China from 1986 to 2016 at 30-m spatial resolution. The resulting map of coastal tidal flats in 2016 was evaluated using very high-resolution images available in Google Earth. The total area of coastal tidal flats in China in 2016 was about 731,170 ha, mostly distributed in the provinces around Yellow River Delta and Pearl River Delta. The interannual dynamics of coastal tidal flats area in China over the last three decades can be divided into three periods: a stable period during 1986-1992, an increasing period during 1993-2001 and a decreasing period during 2002-2016. The resulting annual coastal tidal flats maps could be used to support sustainable coastal zone management policies that preserve coastal ecosystem services and biodiversity in China.

AB Aerosols have adverse health effects and play a significant role in the climate as well. The Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) provides Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at high temporal (daily) and spatial (1 km) resolution, making it particularly useful to infer and characterize spatiotemporal variability of aerosols at a fine spatial scale for exposure assessment and health studies. However, clouds and conditions of high surface reflectance result in a significant proportion of missing MAIAC AOD. To fill these gaps, we present an imputation approach using deep learning with downscaling. Using a baseline autoencoder, we leverage residual connections in deep neural networks to boost learning and parameter sharing to reduce overfitting, and conduct bagging to reduce error variance in the imputations. Downscaled through a similar auto-encoder based deep residual network, Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications Version 2 (MERRA-2) GMI Replay Simulation (M2GMI) data were introduced to the network as an important gap-filling feature that varies in space to be used for missingness imputations. Imputing weekly MAIAC AOD from 2000 to 2016 over California, a state with considerable geographic heterogeneity, our full (non-full) residual network achieved mean R-2 = 0.94 (0.86) [RMSE = 0.007 (0.01)] in an independent test, showing considerably better performance than a regular neural network or non-linear generalized additive model (mean R-2 = 0.78-0.81; mean RMSE = 0.013-0.015). The adjusted imputed as well as combined imputed and observed MAIAC AOD showed strong correlation with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD (R = 0.83; R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.04). Our results show that we can generate reliable imputations of missing AOD through a deep learning approach, having important downstream air quality modeling applications.

AB The development of metrics derived from LiDAR to quantify structural attributes of forests has contributed to substantial advances in wildlife-habitat modeling. However, further exploration of the numerous metrics available for quantifying canopy complexity could improve models of forest wildlife habitat while simultaneously increasing understanding of wildlife-habitat relationships. We used the full set of metrics available in the LiDAR-processing software FUSION, including several structural metrics that have not previously been used in published habitat models, to identify those that best quantify structural attributes associated with nest site occupancy by the Northern Spotted Owl (NSO; Strix occidentalis caurina). We identified the best subset of predictor variables for building a parsimonious predictive model using an objective selection process of alternative MaxEnt models. The simple metric maximum canopy height was the single best predictor of NSO occupancy, but three rarely used structural metrics included in our final model provided a novel means of describing the distribution of vegetation throughout the canopy height profile. These metrics critically contributed to the model's ability to distinguish small patches of structurally complex suitable habitat within a matrix of structurally simple intermediate-aged forest. Our results indicate the potential value of rarely used LiDAR metrics readily available for objectively quantifying ecologically important but previously inaccessible habitat attributes for arboreal species.

AB The paper presents an overview of the results of diagnostic and monitoring activities carried out in the last years through satellite radar interferometry (2011-2016) and in situ measurements (2017-2019) in the historical city of Gubbio, Italy. The study is aimed at contributing to understanding the potential of remote sensing technologies in measuring complex deformation phenomena in historic buildings, such as those caused by soil-structural interaction and earthquakes, considering the monumental Consoli Palace and the Town Walls as case studies. The research activities have been carried out within the European HERACLES project, funded in the framework of Horizon (2020) and aimed at proposing novel diagnostic monitoring solutions for enhancing heritage resilience against various types of hazards. Particular attention is focused on the cross-correlation of the outputs of satellite radar interferometry and in-situ structural monitoring data aimed at achieving engineering meaningful results supporting decision making and proactive interventions.

AB A novel NASA remote sensing technique, airborne fluid lensing, has enabled cm-resolution multispectral 3D remote sensing of aquatic systems, without adverse refractive distortions from ocean waves. In 2013, a drone-based airborne fluid lensing campaign conducted over the coral reef of Ofu Island, American Samoa, revealed complex 3D morphological, ecological, and bathymetric diversity at the cm-scale over a regional area. In this paper, we develop and validate supervised machine learning algorithm products tailored for accurate automated segmentation of coral reefs using airborne fluid lensing multispectral 3D imagery. Results show that airborne fluid lensing can significantly improve the accuracy of coral habitat mapping using remote sensing.
   The machine learning algorithm is based on multidimensional naive-Bayes maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Provided a user-selected training subset of 3D multispectral images, comprising -1% of the total dataset, the algorithm separates living structure from nonliving structure and segments the coral reef into four distinct morphological classes - branching coral, mounding coral, basalt rock, and sand. The user-selected training data and algorithm classification results are created and verified, respectively, with sub-cm-resolution ground-truth maps, manually generated from extensive in-situ mapping, underwater gigapixel photogrammetry, and visual inspection of the 3D dataset with subject matter experts.
   The algorithm generates 3D cm-resolution data products such as living structure and morphology distribution for the Ofu Island coral reef ecosystem with 95% and 92% accuracy, respectively. By comparison, classification of m-resolution remote sensing imagery, representative of the effective spatial resolution of commonly-used airborne and spaceborne aquatic remote sensing instruments subject to ocean wave distortion, typically produces data products with 68% accuracy. These results suggest existing methodologies may not resolve coral reef ecosystems in sufficient detail for accurate determination of percent cover of living structure and morphology breakdown.
   The methods presented here offer a new remote sensing approach enabling repeatable quantitative ecosystem assessment of aquatic systems, independent of ocean wave distortion and sea state. Aquatic remote sensing imagery, free from refractive distortion, appears necessary for accurate and quantitative health assessment capabilities for coral reef ecosystems at the cm-scale, over regional areas. The accurate and automated determination of percent cover and morphology distribution at cm-resolution may lead to a significantly improved understanding of reef ecosystem dynamics and responses in a rapidly-changing global climate.

AB Although Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) change is primarily focused on the types, rates, causes, and consequences of land change, increased anthropogenic development on the ocean's surface, such as offshore oil extraction, offshore wind energy, aquaculture, and coral reef conversion to military outposts, suggest that LULC change not only pertains to historically terrestrial space, but also new lands created on top of ocean surfaces. Therefore, similar human disturbance analyses are necessary for these transformed marine environments, but the lack of accurate, accessible, and up-to-date location information about these spatially dispersed changes significantly limits examination of their environmental impacts. Subsequently these dynamic changes across the oceans are poorly documented. Here, we developed a cloud-native geoprocessing algorithm to automatically detect and extract offshore oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico using synthetic aperture radar and Google Earth Engine. Cross-validated results indicate our top model identified offshore infrastructure with a probability of detection of 98.70%, an overall accuracy of 96.09%, a commission error rate of 2.68%, and an omission error rate of 1.30%. Its generalizability was tested across wind farms in waters of China and the United Kingdom, which resulted in an overall accuracy of 97.00%, a commission error rate of 2.07%, and omission error rate of 0.97%. These generalization capabilities indicate our model can be potentially used to map global offshore infrastructure. Such increased ocean transparency could allow for improved marine environmental management by bringing objectivity, scalability, and accessibility.

AB Vegetation plays an essential role in improving urban environments and enhancing the physical and mental health of residents. However, rapid urbanization has exerted complicated influence on vegetation conditions, which remain poorly understood. To assess the impacts of urbanization on the vegetation structure and function in the urban area, we quantified the changes in impervious surface area (ISA) and assessed the impacts of urbanization on vegetation greenness (enhanced vegetation index (EVI)), and gross primary production (GPP) in megacity Shanghai during 2000-2016. The results show that 38.0% and 28.0% decreasing trends of EVI and GPP occurred in peri-urban and rural areas due to land use and land cover conversion, whereas 2.8% and 4.6% increasing trends of EVI and GPP occurred in the central city during 2000-2016 in Shanghai. In addition, the enhancement of EVI and GPP owing to the indirect impact of urbanization increased as the impervious surface coverage (ISC) gradient rose and peaked when the ISC reached similar to 0.8, which compensated for vegetation loss by 24.6% and 17.0%, respectively. The compensation was more stable and significant in peri-urban areas than urban and rural areas. This study provides detailed data and insights on the impacts of urbanization on vegetation, which may help stakeholders to make better management plans for urban vegetation.

AB The Antarctic Peninsula (AP) has recorded one of the strongest warming rates on the Earth since the 1950s, which, however, turned into a cooling trend since 1999. Snow liquid water emerges in the snowpacks in the AP during melt seasons. Monitoring snow liquid water on the AP is critical for evaluating its impacts on the stability, surface mass and energy balances of ice shelves. Most of our knowledge about the occurrence of snow liquid water (OLW) stems from satellite observations and model simulations. However, the relative performances of OLW products derived from these measurements have never been evaluated due to the lack of in-situ snow wetness measurements. We ranked the OLW determined by the radiometer (i.e., Special Sensor Microwave Imager), scatterometer (i.e., Quick Scatterometer and Advanced Scatterometer) and the Regional Atmospheric Circulation Model (RACMO2) based on categorical triple collocation (CTC) which can identify the most accurate observation with unknown true values. The CTC fusion product was generated by adopting the best source for each pixel during 1999-2017. The cumulative liquid water volume simulated by RACMO2 has significantly declined (at the 99% confidence level) by 210 Gt decade(-1), while the decreasing trends in CTC-fused liquid water days (-1.18 days decade(-1)) and cumulative wet surface (-1.69 x 10(6) days km(2) decade(-1)) were not statistically significant. The significantly negative trend in eastern AP snow liquid water agreed well with the simultaneous cooling, and may be linked with the increased adjacent sea ice.

AB The circum-Arctic transitional zone between forest and tundra, i.e. the treeline zone, is shifting northward due to current Arctic warming and, therefore, requires systematic monitoring. Up to now, radar remote sensing was hardly possible in the treeline zone due to spatial resolution and/or temporal decorrelation constraints of preceding satellite missions. The unique constellation of the TanDEM-X satellites with its bistatic mode and very high spatial resolution opens up opportunities for monitoring small (>= 0.01 km(2)) and isolated patches of very sparse forest which are typical for the transitional zone. We focused on an area at the northern edge of the treeline zone in the Northwest Territories, Canada, and evaluated the potential of TanDEM-X bistatic data to characterize the tree height in the forest patches in this region. TanDEM-X data were acquired during the TanDEM-X Science Phase in 2015, when the perpendicular baseline was large (corresponding to the height of ambiguity of approximately 14.6 m) and kept constant. We employed TanDEM-X backscatter, bistatic coherence, and interferometric height from the stack of seven multitemporal bistatic pairs and compared them to maximum vegetation height obtained from full-waveform airborne LiDAR data. We found strong linear relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and LiDAR vegetation height within the forest patches with r = 0.67, r = -0.69, and r = 0.78 for the backscatter, coherence, and interferometric height, respectively. Furthermore, we extracted the position of individual trees from the LiDAR data and estimated tree density as the number of trees per unit area. The linear relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and the tree density were very weak. The relationships between all TanDEM-X metrics and tree height differentiated for three tree density classes (low, medium, and high) remained strong. Random forests regression using all three TanDEM-X metrics predicted the tree height with a mean absolute error of 0.7 m (mean forest height in the study area was 2.5 m). CoSSC pairs were generally consistent with each other and the multitemporal averaging slightly improved the performance compared to single pairs. Taking into account the global coverage of bistatic TanDEM-X data acquired for the global digital elevation model, our results show a potential for quantifying the tree height in small forest patches along the circum-Arctic treeline zone.

AB Satellites enable widespread, regional or global surveillance of volcanoes and can provide the first indication of volcanic unrest or eruption. Here we consider Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), which can be employed to detect surface deformation with a strong statistical link to eruption. Recent developments in technology as well as improved computational power have resulted in unprecedented quantities of monitoring data, which can no longer be inspected manually. The ability of machine learning to automatically identify signals of interest in these large InSAR datasets has already been demonstrated, but data-driven techniques, such as convolutional neutral networks (CNN) require balanced training datasets of positive and negative signals to effectively differentiate between real deformation and noise. As only a small proportion of volcanoes are deforming and atmospheric noise is ubiquitous, the use of machine learning for detecting volcanic unrest is more challenging than many other applications. In this paper, we address this problem using synthetic interferograms to train the AlexNet CNN. The synthetic interferograms are composed of 3 parts: 1) deformation patterns based on a Monte Carlo selection of parameters for analytic forward models, 2) stratified atmospheric effects derived from weather models and 3) turbulent atmospheric effects based on statistical simulations of correlated noise. The AlexNet architecture trained with synthetic data outperforms that trained using real interferograms alone, based on classification accuracy and positive predictive value (PPV). However, the models used to generate the synthetic signals are a simplification of the natural processes, so we retrain the CNN with a combined dataset consisting of synthetic models and selected real examples, achieving a final PPV of 82%. Although applying atmospheric corrections to the entire dataset is computationally expensive, it is relatively simple to apply them to the small subset of positive results. This further improves the detection performance without a significant increase in computational burden (PPV of 100%). Thus, we demonstrate that training with synthetic examples can improve the ability of CNNs to detect volcano deformation in satellite images, and propose an efficient workflow for the development of automated systems.

AB Understanding how non-material benefits from ecosystems, known as cultural services, are shaped by non-native biota is paramount to manage biological invasions and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Despite recent advances, assessments of cultural services still lack an explicit temporal dimension, which is relevant for developing monitoring systems. Here, we evaluate the spatiotemporal contributions of non-native trees to landscape aesthetics and nature recreation in a National Park in Portugal. We use a multimodel framework to understand how those cultural services (evaluated from social media photos) relate to the environmental context (physical and visual accessibility, and wilderness; derived from ancillary GIS data) and landscape visual-sensory features (colour diversity, landscape heterogeneity, and vegetation functioning). The latter were computed from satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2 MSI sensors) for the four seasons of the year: Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn. We found that, during Autumn, contributions of non-native trees prevailed mostly in landscapes with greater colour diversity (green-band, Sentinel 2). During Spring, their contributions prevailed in landscapes with lower wilderness and heterogeneous levels. In Winter, those contributions were less evident in more remote areas. As for Summer, no significant relations were found for those cultural contributions. These results are congruent with the phenology of dominant tree species: deciduous natives occurring with coniferous non-natives and evergreen invaders, leading to higher colour diversity in Autumn, versus the dominance of blooming invaders in accessible areas during Spring. Results also seem to match the seasonal dynamics of touristic demand in the National Park: the pursuit of wilder areas for ecotourism in Winter, versus the experience of popular recreational activities in Summer. We discuss the usefulness of Earth observations in the research of cultural services and, particularly, for supporting SDG targets 15.8 (on invasive species), 8.9 (touristic revenues) and 12.8 (nature awareness).

AB The composition of the plant canopy is a key attribute of terrestrial ecosystems, influencing the fluxes of carbon, water, and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. Terrestrial ecosystem and biosphere models, which are used to predict how ecosystems are expected to respond to changes in climate, atmospheric CO2, and land-use change, require accurate representations of plant canopy composition at large spatial scales. The ability to accurately specify plant canopy composition is important because it determines the physiological and ecological properties of plants (such as leaf photosynthetic capacity, patterns of plant carbon allocation and tissue turnover, and the resulting dynamics of plant demography) that govern the biophysical and biogeochemical functioning of ecosystems. Traditionally, plant canopy composition has been represented in a coarse-grained manner within terrestrial biosphere models, with ecosystems being comprised of a single plant functional type (PFT). However, models are increasingly seeking to represent fine-scale spatial variation in plant functional diversity. In this study, we show how imaging spectrometry measurements can provide spatially-comprehensive estimates of within-biome heterogeneity in PFT composition across a functionally diverse and topographically heterogeneous similar to 710 km(2) area in the Southern Sierra Mountains of California. AVIRIS (Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data at 18 m resolution from the recent HyspIRI Preparatory Mission (Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager) were used to estimate the sub-pixel fractions of seven PFTs represented in the ED2 terrestrial biosphere model: Shrub, Oak, Western Hardwood, Western Pine, Cedar/Fir, and High-elevation Pine, plus a Grass/NPV (Non-Photosynthetic Vegetation) fraction using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). ED2 is an individual-based terrestrial biosphere model capable of representing fine-scale sub-pixel ecosystem heterogeneity. Our results show that this methodology captures important elevation-related shifts in canopy composition that occur within the study area that are not resolved by existing multi-spectral land-cover products. These estimates modestly improved when the putative PFT endmembers considered in the mixture analysis were constrained using available geospatial data about the presence and absence of the PFTs in particular areas: the average RMSEs (root-mean-square errors) with the geospatially-constrained versus conventional method were 11.3% and 11.9% respectively, with larger reductions in the bias (i.e. mean error) in the abundances of Oak, Cedar/Fir, and Western Hardwood PFTs (ranging from 2.0% to 7.8%). At the hectare scale around four flux towers in the Southern Sierra Mountains, the overall composition improved from an RMSE of 18.2% (5.0-24.2% for individual PFTs) to an RMSE of 9.5% (3.3-13.2% for individual PFTs). Downgrading AVIRIS to 30 m resolution resulted in a reduction in accuracy of the constrained method to an RMSE of 12.7% (0-23.7%) with < 1% change in the bias for all tree and shrub PFTs. Our results demonstrate that imaging spectrometry measurements from planned satellite missions such as HyspIRI, EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program), and HISUI (Hyper-spectral Imager SUIte) can provide important and much-needed information about fine-scale heterogeneity in the composition of plant canopies for constraining and improving terrestrial ecosystem and biosphere model simulations of regional- and global-scale vegetation dynamics and function.

AB This paper formulates cloud and cloud shadow detection as a semantic segmentation problem and proposes a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based method to detect them in Landsat imagery. Different from traditional machine learning methods, deep CNN-based methods convolve the entire input image to extract multi-level spatial and spectral features, and then deconvolve these features to produce the detailed segmentation. In this way, multi-level features from the whole image and all the bands are utilized to label each pixel as cloud, thin cloud, cloud shadow or clear. An adaption of SegNet with 13 convolutional layers and 13 deconvolution layers is proposed in this study. The method is applied to 38 Landsat 7 images and 32 Landsat 8 images which are globally distributed and have pixel-wise cloud and cloud shadow reference masks provided by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). In order to process such large images using the adapted SegNet model on a desktop computer, the Landsat Collection 1 scenes are split into non-overlapping 512 * 512 30 m pixel image blocks. 60% of these blocks are used to train the model using the backpropagation algorithm, 10% of the blocks are used to validate the model and tune its parameters, and the remaining 30% of the blocks are used for performance evaluation. Compared with the cloud and cloud shadow masks produced by CFMask, which are provided with the Landsat Collection 1 data, the overall accuracies are significantly improved from 89.88% and 84.58% to 95.26% and 95.47% for the Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images respectively. The proposed method benefits from the multi-level spatial and spectral features, and results in more than a 40% increase in user's accuracy and in more than a 20% increase in producer's accuracy for cloud shadow detection in Landsat 8 imagery. The issues for operational implementation are discussed.

AB Remote sensing landscape monitoring approaches frequently benefit from a dense time series of observations. To enhance these time series, data from multiple satellite systems need to be integrated. Landsat image data is a valuable 30-meter resolution source of spatial information to assess forest conditions over time. Together both operational Landsat satellites-7 and 8 provide a revisit frequency of 8 days at the equator. This moderate temporal frequency provides essential information to detect annual large area abrupt land cover changes. However, the ability to measure subtle and short lived intraseasonal changes is challenged by gaps in Landsat imagery at key points in time. The first Sentinel-2 satellite mission was launched by the European Space Agency in 2015. This moderate resolution data stream provides an opportunity to supplement the Landsat data record. The objective of this study is to assess the potential for integrating top of atmosphere Landsat and Sentinel 2 image data archived in the Google Earth Engine compute environment. In this paper we assess absolute and proportional differences in near-contemporaneous observations for six bands with comparable spectral response functions and spatial resolution between the Sentinel-2 Multi Spectral Instrument and Landsat Operational Land Imager and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. We assessed differences using absolute difference metrics and major axis linear regression between over 10,000 image pairs across the conterminous United States and present cross sensor transformation models. Major axis linear regression results indicate that Sentinel MSI data are as spectrally comparable to the two types of Landsat image data as the Landsat sensors are with each other. Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values ranging from 0.0121 to 0.0398 were obtained between MSI and Landsat spectral values, and RMSD values ranging from 0.0124 and 0.0372 were obtained between OLI and ETM +. Despite differences in their spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics, integration of these datasets appears to be feasible through the application of bandwise linear regression corrections.

AB Water surface elevation (WSE) is an essential quantity for water resource monitoring and hydrodynamic modeling. Satellite altimetry has provided data for inland water bodies. The height that is derived from altimetry measurement is ellipsoidal height. In order to convert the ellipsoidal height to orthometric height, which has physical meaning, accurate estimates of the geoid are needed. This paper evaluates the suitability of geodetic altimetric measurements for improvement of global geoid models over a large lake in the Tibetan Plateau. CryoSat-2 and SARAL/AltiKa are used to derive the high-frequency geoid correction. A validation of the local geoid correction is performed with data from in-situ observations, a laser altimetry satellite (ICESat), a Ka-band radar altimetry satellite (SARAL) and a SAR radar altimetry satellite (Sentinel-3). Results indicate that the geodetic altimetric dataset can capture the high-resolution geoid information. By applying local geoid correction, the precision of ICESat, SARAL and Sentinel-3 retrievals are significantly improved. We conclude that using geodetic altimetry to correct for local geoid residual over large lakes significantly decreases the uncertainty of WSE estimates. These results also indicate the potential of geodetic altimetry missions to determine local geoid residual with centimeter-level accuracy, which can be used to improve global and regional geopotential models.

AB This study aimed to improve the potential of Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) hyperspectral and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) data in predicting soil organic matter content (SOMC) in the bare topsoil of the Ebinur Lake Wetland National Nature Reserve (ELWNNR) in northwest China. The results indicated that the correlation of coefficients (R) between SOMCs and hyperspectral data processed by fractional derivative were significant at the 0.01 level; the number of wave bands increased initially and then decreased when the order increased. The correlation of coefficient peak appeared at the 1.2 order with a value of 0.52. The correlation of coefficients (R) between SOMCs and the optimal remote sensing indexes (the ratio index, RI; difference index, DI; and the normalized difference index, NDI) of peaked at the 1.2 order, with correlation of coefficients (R) values of 0.81, 0.86 and 0.82, respectively. Six SOMC estimation models were created by means of a single band and optimal remote sensing indexes using Gray Relational Analysis-BP Neural Network (GRA-BPNN). This study found that the optimal model was a 1.2 order derivative model, where the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) was 3.26 g/kg, the highest was 0.92, and the residual prediction deviation (RPD) was 2.26. To complete the high accuracy retrieval of SOMCs, based on Landsat OLI operational land images data, more 'hidden' information from the Landsat OLI images were obtained by employing the subsection of spectral band method and the fractional derivative algorithm. Accuracy of the SOMC map was attained by the optimal model of the ground hyperspectral data and the Landsat OLI data, which had low RMSE values of 4.21 g/kg and 4.16 g/kg, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that the SOMC can be estimated and retrieved using a fractional derivative algorithm, the subsection of spectral band method, and the optimal remote sensing index.

AB The southeastern U.S. produces the most industrial roundwood in the U.S. each year, largely from commercial pine plantations. The extent of plantation forests and management dynamics can be difficult to ascertain from periodic forest inventories, yet short-rotation tree plantations also present challenges for remote sensing. Here, we integrated spectral, temporal, and structural information from airborne and satellite platforms to distinguish pine plantations from natural forests and evaluate the contribution from planted forests to regional forest cover in the southeastern U.S. Within flight lines from NASA Goddard's Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal (G-LiHT) Airborne Imager, lidar metrics of forest structure had the highest overall accuracy for pine plantations among single-source classifications (90%), but the combination of spectral and temporal metrics from Landsat generated comparable accuracy (91%). Combined structural, temporal, and spectral information from G-LiHT and Landsat had the highest accuracy for plantations (92%) and natural forests (88%). At a regional scale, classifications using Landsat spectral and temporal metrics had between 74 and 82% mean class accuracy for plantations. Regionally, plantations accounted for 28% of forest cover in the southeastern U.S., a result similar to plot-based estimates, albeit with greater spatial detail. Regional maps of plantation forests differed from existing map products, including the National Land Cover Database. Combining plantation extent in 2011 with Landsat-based forest change data identified strong regional gradients in plantation dynamics since 1985, with distinct spatial patterns of rotation age (east-west) and plantation expansion (interior). Our analysis demonstrates the potential to improve the characterization of dynamic land cover classes, including economically important timber plantations, by integrating diverse remote sensing datasets. Critically, multi-source remote sensing provides an approach to leverage periodic forest inventory data for annual monitoring of managed forest landscapes.

AB In this work, we investigate the past and present land deformation in Al Wagan area in the United Arab Emirates. The area is primarily an agricultural region where dependence on groundwater is documented. Such a reliance on ground water resources in a region which is characterized by very low precipitation can lead to significant land subsidence as was observed in this study which identified fast and localized deformation trends. The quantification of ground deformations of large magnitude and small amplitude in this area with SAR Interferometry is a challenging task using moderate resolution data due to the incoherent surface background. Even though SAR acquisitions were sparse over this region, the available ENVISAT, ALOS and Sentinel-1A imagery was analysed with differential interferometry and the Small Baseline Subset technique in order to provide estimates about the evolution of the deformation pattern in a limited area. A clear evidence of subsidence phenomena has been identified in the study area. During the period 2003-2010 the subsidence was estimated to reach 18 cm/year as observed in the DInSAR processing results of data from ENVISAT and ALOS Satellites. However it appears to be slightly more stable during the recent past (Dec/2016-March/2018) as observed in the results with recent Sentinel-1 data where a maximum localized subsidence in the order of 10 cm was estimated. The depletion of the aquifer resources which is confirmed from groundwater level data is speculated to be the most probable cause.

AB High-resolution satellite images of the ocean surface in and around the sunglint often provide unique observations of sub-mesoscale upper ocean surface processes. Local anomalies of wind, waves, currents or surfactants appear on the images as local anomalies of brightness. A quantitative interpretation of those brightness anomalies must relate them to slope properties of the wave field, which are to the lowest order described by the mean square slope (mss).
   The prevailing paradigm for such interpretation is that of the critical zenith angle. It states that, for subcritical zenith view angle, brightness and mss anomalies have opposite signs, and this defines the so-called inversion region. This prevailing paradigm implicitly builds on the assumption that the mss decomposition between upwind and crosswind components is conserved. The mss anomalies are then isotropic and can be reduced to a scalar (i.e. one-dimensional) quantity. In such a case, one single sunglint image would be sufficient to retrieve the mss anomaly. This isotropic case likely applies for surface wave changes induced by varying wind speed or by surfactants.
   Yet, satellite and airborne observations at multiple view angles recently revealed anisotropic mss anomalies, e.g. with mss increase in the upwind direction and decrease in the crosswind direction. This anisotropic behavior likely characterizes wave modulations by anisotropic surface current gradients. This paper details the expected properties of such anisotropic mss modulations. It is shown that: 1) The classical concept of critical angle does not systematically hold, neither for frontal current shear nor for internal wave divergence. 2) At least two sunglint images at different zenith and azimuth angles are needed to retrieve the mss anomalies, and a single observation is not sufficient. 3) A satellite with radiometers looking at multiple zenith angles is capable of providing a geometry favorable to retrieve mss anomalies. An illustration is discussed with internal waves observed by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), where the upwind and crosswind components of the retrieved mss anomalies are anisotropic. Those results provide guidelines to interpret available observations and to help refine strategy for future satellite missions.

AB Urban heat island (UHI) has become an urban eco-environmental problem globally. Land surface temperature (LST) is widely used to quantify UHI. This study used Shenzhen, a southern coastal city in China, as an example to explore the relationship between spatial variation of LST in different seasons and the influencing factors in five dimensions, integrating the methods of ordinary least-squares regression, stepwise regression, all-subsets regression, and hierarchical partitioning analysis. The results showed that the most important factor affecting spatial heterogeneity of LST in summer was the normalized difference build-up index (53.62%, for contributing rate), whereas in the transition season the most important factor was the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (47.84%). In winter the construction land percentage and NDVI (26.84% and 25.56%, respectively) were the most influential. Artificial surface and green space had a dominant effect on LST spatial differentiation. Landscape configuration and diversity were not the dominant influencing factors in summer or in the transition season. Furthermore, the independent contribution rate of the Shannon diversity index (SHDI) reached 8.79% in the transition season, while in winter, the independent contribution rates of SHDI and the landscape shape index were 8.52% and 3.45%, respectively. The influence of landscape diversity and configuration factors tended to increase as LST reduced, while the contribution rate of the important factors such as artificial surface and green space decreased significantly. These relationships indicate that the influence of landscape configuration and diversity factors on LST is relatively weak, and can be easily concealed by the influence of landscape components, especially when the spatial variation of LST is not strong. These findings can help to develop UHI adaptation strategies based on local conditions.

AB We present a novel approach for the prediction of forest growing stock volume based on explanatory variables from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) image photogrammetry without relying on the availability of a digital terrain model. This DTM-independent approach was developed to avoid the need for a detailed DTM, which is instead required in traditional photogrammetry to obtain relative heights above the terrain. The method, following an Area Based Approach (ABA), was tested in a boreal forest on a flat area in Norway and in a temperate mixed forest in a mountain steep terrain in Italy, on the basis of aerial images acquired with a SenseFly eBee Ag fixed-wing UAV.
   The plot level predictive performance of the models based on the DTM-independent metrics were evaluated against the results based on two more traditional approaches based on: (i) metrics from UAV photogrammetric data normalized using a DTM from airborne laser scanning (ALS), and (ii) metrics from ALS data. Percent root mean square error of predictions against measured values (RMSE % ) was used for quantifying the performance of the different tests.
   Results revealed that the DTM-independent approach produced comparable results with both the traditional photogrammetric and ALS methods (the RMSE % ranged between 15.9% and 16.7% in Italy, and between 16.3% and 17.9% in Norway).
   Our results demonstrated that UAV photogrammetry can be used effectively for predicting forest growing stock volume even when high-resolution DTMs are not available, hence increasing the potentiality of UAVs in forest monitoring and inventory.

AB Accurate and timely spatial classification of crop types based on remote sensing data is important for both scientific and practical purposes. Spatially explicit crop-type information can be used to estimate crop areas for a variety of monitoring and decision-making applications such as crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and financial market forecasting. However, there is no publically available spatially explicit in-season crop-type classification information for the U.S. Corn Belt (a landscape predominated by corn and soybean). Instead, researchers and decision-makers have to wait until four to six months after harvest to have such information from the previous year. The state-of-the-art research on crop-type classification has been shifted from relying on only spectral features of single static images to combining together spectral and time-series information. While Landsat data have a desirable spatial resolution for field-level crop-type classification, the ability to extract temporal phenology information based on Landsat data remains a challenge due to low temporal revisiting frequency and inevitable cloud contamination. To address this challenge and generate accurate, cost-effective, and in-season crop-type classification, this research uses the USDA's Common Land Units (CLUs) to aggregate spectral information for each field based on a time-series Landsat image data stack to largely overcome the cloud contamination issue while exploiting a machine learning model based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and high-performance computing for intelligent and scalable computation of classification processes. Experiments were designed to evaluate what information is most useful for training the machine learning model for crop-type classification, and how various spatial and temporal factors affect the crop-type classification performance in order to derive timely crop type information. All experiments were conducted over Champaign County located in central Illinois, and a total of 1322 Landsat multi-temporal scenes including all the six optical spectral bands spanning from 2000 to 2015 were used. Computational experiments show the inclusion of temporal phenology information and evenly distributed spatial training samples in the study domain improves classification performance. The shortwave infrared bands show notably better performance than the widely used visible and near-infrared bands for classifying corn and soybean. In comparison with USDA's Crop Data Layer (CDL), this study found a relatively high Overall Accuracy (i.e. the number of the corrected classified fields divided by the number of the total fields) of 96% for classifying corn and soybean across all CLU fields in the Champaign County from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, our approach achieved 95% Overall Accuracy by late July of the concurrent year for classifying corn and soybean. The findings suggest the methodology presented in this paper is promising for accurate, cost-effective, and in-season classification of field-level crop types, which may be scaled up to large geographic extents such as the U.S. Corn Belt.

AB We developed a methodology to evaluate quantitative uncertainty characteristics of satellite data retrievals including the contribution of systematic error and statistical error. This is introduced by assessing the total product error of optical, satellite data-based, Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) estimates. Here the FSC estimation is based on an algorithm allowing the consideration of the effect of different error sources; a semi-empirical reflectance model describing the relationship of the observed reflectance and FSC through several variables and parameters. We assume that after the statistical error analysis, the remaining portion of total product error arises due to systematic factors. Hence, first we define a statistical error component through the theory of error propagation, and then estimate the total product error (PE) by using in situ observations on FSC, and finally derive the systematic error from these two error components. The experimental approach for estimating PE is conducted through an analysis of the observed estimation errors (i.e. residuals) in the GlobSnow Snow Extent (SE) v2.1 products on FSC. In practice, independent in situ snow course observations from Finland on FSC are compared to corresponding satellite FSC estimates to quantify the residuals. The approach is then illustrated for an extended region of corresponding European boreal forest. Our results show that the total PE in the GlobSnow FSC product is significantly higher than the originally provided statistical error. This is due to deficiencies in the parameterization of the applied forward modelling approach, in particular in the consideration of the forest canopy effects.

AB Satellite-based measurements of synthetic aperture radar amplitude provide a method for monitoring volcanoes during unrest and eruptions even when visual observations are not possible, for example due to poor weather or at night, and when radar phase measurements are noisy or decorrelated. Here, we use high resolution radar amplitude images from the TerraSAR-X and COSMO SkyMed satellites to investigate surface changes associated with explosive eruptions of Cotopaxi volcano, Ecuador in August 2015. We generate change difference and amplitude ratio maps spanning the start of explosive activity at Cotopaxi, which show complex spatial variations in radar amplitude both on and around the summit ice-cap that we attribute to a number of processes related to the eruption. Observed amplitude decreases are caused by crater deepening, ashfall onto ice and surface smoothing by ashfall onto slopes facing away from the satellite, while amplitude increases are due to deposition of coarse lapilli and wet tephra, increased soil saturation due to geothermally driven glacier melting, and smoothing of slopes facing towards the satellite. We discuss the potential applications of radar amplitude images for monitoring and hazard evaluation at active volcanoes.

AB The dynamics of landfast sea ice, also called fast ice for short, has a large influence on the variability of polynyas and marine ecosystems, and the logistics for research stations near the Antarctic coast. Therefore, it is important to accurately measure the strain of fast ice and its seasonal variations, and to identify the cause of stresses on the ice. In this paper, we separate the strains from glacial stress and tidal stress of fast ice near the Campbell Glacier Tongue (CGT) in Terra Nova Bay, East Antarctica. This was done using observations from a series of one-day tandem COSMO-SkyMed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images obtained from December 2010 to January 2012. Firstly, we discriminated fast ice from pack ice and open water by analyzing the interferometric coherence values. We then identified the characteristics of the strains by investigating the equidisplacement lines of fringes in weekly InSAR and double-differential InSAR (DDInSAR) images. The weekly InSAR images predominantly showed glacial shear strain of the fast ice with fringes parallel to the sides of the CGT. This was due to the cumulative flow of the CGT for a week, while oscillating tidal signals were relatively small. The DDInSAR images, which cancelled glacial strain rates in two one-day InSAR images, showed a deformation of the fast ice by tidal sea surface tilt, with the fringes parallel to the coastline. Based on the unique characteristics of these strains, we separated them from the one-day InSAR images by decomposing the fringe patterns into glacial and tidal strain. Glacial shear strain rates of fast ice attached to the east of the CGT decreased from May to August owing to ice thickening and then stabilized until December. Those to the west of the CGT increased from May to July. This was possibly due to bottom melting of the ice by the increased ocean circulation during the expansion period of the nearby polynya. The glacial strain then decreased until December because of reduced polynya activity. The fast ice near the Jang Bogo Station (JBS) only showed tidal strain as it was isolated from the CGT by cracks and leads. Tidal strain rates of the fast ice were strongly correlated with the magnitude of tidal variations in all these regions, which represents shows that the tidal strain represents tidal sea surface tilt. The tidal response of fast ice to the west of the CGT and near the JBS was stronger than that to the east of the CGT, probably owing to thinner ice thickness there.

AB Satellite passive microwave (PM) sensors have observed sea ice in Polar Regions and provided sea ice concentration (SIC) data since the 1970s. SIC has been used as a primary data source for climate change prediction and ship navigation. However, the accuracy of PM SIC is typically low and biased in summer. To provide more accurate information for climatic research and ship navigation, it is necessary to evaluate quantitatively the accuracy of PM SIC and to account for its errors. In this research, we evaluated the SIC data derived from PM measurements using four representative sea ice algorithms: NASA Team (NT), Bootstrap (BT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) hybrid, and Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction STudy (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI). Analyses were performed for the Chukchi Sea in summer using KOrean Multi-Purpose SATellite-5 (KOMPSAT-5) Enhanced Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Ice/water maps were generated by binary classification of texture features in the SAR images based on Random Forest, a rule-based machine learning approach. SIC values estimated from the sea ice algorithms showed good correlation with those calculated from the KOMPSAT-5 ice/water maps, but the root mean square error was larger than 10%. SIC values estimated from the algorithms showed different error trends according to the KOMPSAT-5 SIC range. All algorithms overestimated SIC values in open drift ice zones (KOMPSAT-5 SICs ranged from 0% to 15%). In marginal ice zones (SICs ranged from 15% to 80%), the OSISAF SIC values were the least biased compared to those from KOMPSAT-5. The NT algorithm largely underestimated SIC values in marginal ice zones, while the BT and ASI algorithms overestimated them considerably. All algorithms, except for BT, underestimated SIC in consolidated pack ice zones (SICs ranged from 80% to 100%). By analyzing the correlations of biases of SIC from the algorithms with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the European Reanalysis Agency Interim reanalysis, it was found that the overestimation of NT and ASI SICs was largely influenced by atmospheric water vapor content, while the underestimation of NT and OSISAF SICs was owing to ice surface melting. The overestimation of BT SICs was not significantly correlated with the NWP data. The underestimated SIC from the BT and ASI algorithms for high SIC regions might be compensated by the atmospheric water vapor content. The differences in SIC values estimated from each algorithm were due to different sensitivities to atmospheric water vapor content in the regions with KOMPSAT-5 SIC lower than 40% and to ice surface melting in the regions with higher KOMPSAT-5 SIC.

AB For remote sensing-assisted natural resource inventories, the effects of spatial resolution in the form of pixel size and the effects of subpixel information on estimates of population parameters were evaluated by comparing results obtained using Landsat 8 and RapidEye auxiliary imagery. The study area was in Burkina Faso, and the response variable of interest was firewood volume (m(3)/ha). A sample consisting of 160 field plots was selected from the population following a two-stage sampling design. Models were fit using weighted least squares; the population mean, mu, and the variance of the estimator of the population mean, V ((mu) over cap), were estimated using two inferential frameworks, model-based and model-assisted, and compared. For each framework, V((mu) over cap) was estimated both analytically and empirically. Empirical variances were estimated using bootstrapping that accounted for the two-stage sampling. The primary results were twofold. First, for the effects of spatial resolution and subpixel information, four conclusions are relevant: (1) finer spatial resolution imagery indeed contributed to greater precision for estimators of population parameter, but despite the finer spatial resolution of RapidEye, the increase was only marginal, on the order of 10% for model-based variance estimators and 36% for model assisted variance estimators; (2) subpixel information on texture was marginally beneficial for inference of large area population parameters; (3) RapidEye did not offer enough of an improvement to justify its cost relative to the free Landsat 8 imagery; and (4) for a given plot size, candidate remote sensing auxiliary datasets are more cost-effective when their spatial resolutions are similar to the plot size than with much finer alternatives. Second, for the comparison between estimators, three conclusions are relevant: (1) sampling distribution for the model based V((mu) over cap) was more concentrated and smaller on the order of 42% to 59% than that for the model-assisted V((mu) over cap), suggesting superior consistency and efficiency of model-based inference to model-assisted inference; (2) bootstrapping is an effective alternative to analytical variance estimators; and (3) prediction accuracy expressed by RMSE is useful for screening candidate models to be used for population inferences.

AB Satellite approaches for estimation of the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) and air-sea flux of CO2 in coastal regions offer the potential to reduce uncertainties in coastal carbon budgets and improve understanding of spatial and temporal patterns and the factors influencing them. We used satellite-derived products in combination with an extensive data set of ship-based observations to develop an unprecedented multi-year time-series of pCO(2) and air-sea flux of CO2 in the northern Gulf of Mexico for the period 2006-2010. A regression tree algorithm was used to relate satellite-derived products for chlorophyll, sea surface temperature, and dissolved and detrital organic matter to ship observations of pCO(2). The resulting relationship had an r(2) of 0.827 and a prediction error of 31.7 mu atm pCO(2) (root mean-squared error of the relationship was 28.8 mu atm). Using a wind speed and gas exchange relationship along with satellite winds, estimates of air-sea flux of CO2 were derived yielding an average annual flux over the period 2006-2010 of -0.8 to -1.5 (annual mean = -1.1 +/- 0.3) mol C m(-2) y(-1), where the negative value indicates net ocean uptake. The estimated total annual CO2 flux for the study region was -4.3 + 1.1 Tg C y(-1) Relationships of satellite-derived pCO(2) with salinity were consistent with shipboard observations and exhibited a concave relationship with low values at mid- and low salinities attributed to strong biological drawdown of CO2 in the high productivity river-mixing zone. The time-series of satellite-derived pCO(2) was characterized by a seasonal pattern with values lower during winter and spring, low to intermediate values during fall, and higher and more variable values during summer. These findings were similar to simulations from a coupled physical-biogeochemical model. A seasonal pattern was also evident in the air-sea flux of CO2 with generally more negative fluxes (i.e., ocean uptake) during winter and spring, and positive fluxes during summer months with fall being a period of transition. Interannual variations in annual means of both air-sea flux of CO2 and DIN loading were significant, with higher DIN loading coinciding in some cases with more negative air-sea flux of CO2 (i.e., net ocean uptake). Spatial patterns of pCO(2) reflected regional environmental forcing including effects of river discharge, wind forcing, and shelf-slope circulation. Our study also illustrates the utility of satellite extrapolation for highlighting areas that may contribute significantly to regional signals and for guiding prioritization of locations for acquiring further observations. The approach should be readily applicable to other regions given adequate availability of in situ observations for algorithm development.

AB Ground-based observations (2014-2015) indicated that the precipitable water vapor (PWV) values in China exhibited large spatial and temporal variations. The annual mean PWV values ranged from 4.0 +/- 2.9 mm to 42.3 +/- 10.6 mm from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau to the South China Sea, and the seasonal variation ranged from 1.9 +/- 1.2 mm to 50.5 +/- 5.4 mm. The PWV values were retrieved from MODIS, VIRR and MERSI data, and the accuracies varied widely with relative errors from 10% to 899%. VIRR performed the best in the humid southern coastal regions of China (R = 93%) where the annual PWV was as high as 35 mm. MERSI was more suitable in the dry western region of China (R = 84%) where the average PWV value was lower than 15 mm. MODIS PWV products could be used to accurately observe the PWV in the city and urbanized areas of the eastern China Plain (R = 89%) where the annual mean PWV was 20-30 mm. All of the products yielded larger errors in the summer than in the winter. The MOD05 and MOD07 data performed better than the other satellite data in most regions.

AB Seasonal snow cover and its melt dominate regional climate and hydrology in many mountainous regions in the world. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products have been widely used for regional hydrological modeling. However, data gaps in snow products due to frequent clouds remain a serious problem, particularly for daily products. This paper presents a spatio-temporal modeling technique for filling up data gaps in daily snow cover estimates, based on time series of Terra/Aqua MODIS images. The spatio-temporal modeling technique integrates MODIS spectral information, spatial and temporal contextual information, and environmental association within a Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) framework. The performance of our new technique is quantitatively evaluated by comparing our snow cover estimates with in situ observations at 33 SNOTEL stations as well as to original MODIS snow cover products over the Upper Rio Grande Basin during 2006-2008 snow seasons. Mainly due to cloud obscuration, there are as high as 32% data gaps in original Terra/Aqua combined MODIS snow products. Our HMRF technique reduced cloud-cover related data gaps to < 1% and achieved a snow -mapping accuracy of 88.0% for the gap-filled areas. For the areas not covered by clouds, our HMRF-based technique also improved the snow cover estimate accuracy of original MODIS snow products by 3.5%, from 85.1% to 88.6%. When spatio-temporal contextual information and environmental association information are progressively incorporated within the HMRF framework, the overall snow mapping accuracies are improved and omission errors are reduced. Particularly, our HMRF-based technique increased the snow product accuracy by 4.2% during whole transition periods, and by 6.2% in March during snow melt. The snow mapping accuracies were significantly improved over evergreen forests and mixed forests.

AB Incident shortwave radiation (SW), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and diffuse PAR (PAR(dif)) at the land surface drive a multitude of processes related to biosphere-atmosphere interactions and play a critical role in the Earth climate system. Previous global solar radiation products were spatially coarse (> 50-km resolution) or temporally short (a few years), which hindered scaling-up ground based observations of the land surface processes into regional, continental, and global scales across multiple time scales. Here, we report Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) SW, PAR, and PAR(dif) products over the global land surface at a 5 km resolution with 4 day intervals between 2000 and 2016. We combined an atmospheric radiative transfer model with an artificial neural network (ANN) to compute SW, PAR, and PAR(dif). A series of MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmosphere and land products were used as inputs to run the ANN. We test the performance of the products using data from 158 (SW), 77 (PAR), and 22 (PARdif) stations collected in the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) and flux tower networks, which covered a range of climatic zones from polar to tropical zones. BESS had strong linear relationships with in-situ SW data (R-2 = 0.95, relative bias = -2.3%), PAR (R-2 = 0.94, relative bias = 1.7%), and PAR hf (R-2 = 0.84, relative bias = 0.2%). BESS captured the interannual variability of SW at both the site (a majority of long-term BSRN sites) and continental levels. Over the study period, global annual SW; PAR, and PAR(dif) values did not show any dimming or brightening trends, although these trends appeared at regional levels, e.g. dimming in India. Mean annual SW over the global land surface was 184.8 W m(-2) (875 ZJ yr(-1), zetta = 10(21)); 46% of SW was partitioned to PAR, which was further split into direct (59%) and diffuse (41%) components. The developed products will be useful in solar energy harvesting research and will improve water, carbon, and energy flux estimates of terrestrial ecosystems from local to the global scales.

AB This paper focuses on the inter-comparison of integrated water vapor (IWV) products derived from the following satellite instruments: Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument (GOME-2), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites, Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Spining Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS), and Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY). IWV data from GPS in nine ground based stations located in the Iberian Peninsula are used as reference. The study period extends from 2007 to 2012. The results show that, in general, OMI has good accuracy (pseudomedian of the relative differences between OMI and GPS IWV of (-0.7 +/- 1.1)%). However, OMI, SCIAMACHY and AIRS show higher inter quartile range (IQR) (which indicates lower precision) than the rest of satellite instruments. Both MODIS satellite instruments and SEVIRI products tend to slightly underestimate reference IWV data while GOME-2 exhibits a notable overestimation (16.7 +/- 0.8%). All satellite instruments showed a tendency to reduce IWV extreme values: low IWV is overestimated while high IWV is underestimated. As for the influence of solar zenith angle (SZA), it can be observed that GOME-2 strongly overestimates the reference for high SZA values (by around 60% for SZA 60 - 80 degrees). OMI shows, however, a high IQR for high SZA values. Both MODIS instruments show an increase in the pseudomedian of relative differences and IQR with SZA at daytime, with more stable values at night. Seasonal dependence is mainly due to the SZA and IWV typical values in each season. In general, in summer the tendency is to underestimate with low IQR (which happens when IWV is high and SZA is low), and in winter the trend is to overestimate with high IQR (which happens when IWV is low and SZA is high). SCIAMACHY shows a high pseudomedian in summer and autumn, and lower in winter and spring. It must be noted that GOME-2 shows a higher overestimation and OMI shows a higher IQR than other satellite instruments in winter and autumn. The influence of clouds was also studied, showing an increase of IQR as cloudiness increases in all satellites. Pseudomedian also worsens as cloudiness increases, generally.

AB We present in this work a methodology for computing surface deformation time series and mean velocity maps of large areas. Our approach relies on the availability of a multi-temporal set of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data collected from ascending and descending orbits over an area of interest, and also permits us to estimate the vertical and horizontal (East-West) components of the Earth's surface deformation. The adopted methodology is based on an advanced cloud computing implementation of the differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) Parallel Small Baseline Subset (P-SBAS) processing chain which allows the unsupervised processing of large SAR data volumes, from the raw data (level-0) imagery up to the generation of the corresponding DInSAR time series and maps. The solution presented, which is highly scalable, has been tested on ascending and descending ENVISAT SAR archives comprising approximately 400 GB of data, which have been acquired over a large area of southern California (US) that extends over about 90,000 km(2). Such an input dataset has been processed in parallel by exploiting 280 computing nodes of the Amazon Web Services Cloud environment The overall processing lasted about 8 h and cost approximately $1900 USD. Moreover, to produce the final mean deformation velocity maps of the vertical and horizontal (East-West) displacement components of the whole investigated area, we also took advantage of the information available from external GPS measurements that permit us to account for possible regional trends not easily detectable by DInSAR and to refer the P-SBAS measurements to an external geodetic datum.
   The results presented clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach that paves the way to the extensive use of the available ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT SAR data archives. Furthermore, the proposed methodology can be particularly suitable to deal with the very large data flow provided by the Sentinel-1 constellation, thus permitting the extension of the DInSAR analyses at a nearly global scale.

AB Very high spatial resolution (VHSR) optical satellite imagery has shown good potential to provide non-saturating proxies of tropical forest aboveground biomass (AGB) from the analysis of canopy texture, for instance through the Fourier Transform Textural Ordination method. Empirical case studies however showed that the relationship between Fourier texture features and forest AGB varies across forest types and regions of the world, limiting model transferability. A better understanding of the biophysical mechanisms on which canopy texture forest AGB relation relies is a prerequisite to move toward broad scale applications. Here we simulated VHSR optical canopy scenes in identical sun-sensor geometry for 279 1-ha tropical forest inventory plots distributed across the tropics. Our aim was to assess the respective merits and complementarity of two types of texture analysis techniques (i.e. Fourier and lacunarity) on a set of forests with contrasted structure and geographical origin, and develop a general texture-based approach for tropical forest AGB mapping. Across forests, Fourier texture captured a gradient of stands mean crown size reflecting well the progressive changes in stand structure throughout forest aggradation phase (e.g. Pearson's r = - 0.42 with basal area) while lacunarity texture captured a gradient of canopy openness (, i.e. Pearson's r = - 0.57 with stand gap fraction). Both types of texture indices were highly complementary for predicting forest AGB at the global level (so-called FL-model). The residual error of the FL-model was structured across sites and could be partially captured with a bioclimatic proxy, further improving the performance of the global model (so-called FLE-model) and reducing site-level biases. The FLE model was tested on a set of real Pleiades images covering a mosaic of high-biomass forests in the Congo basin (mean AGB over 49 field plots: 359 98 Mg ha(-1)), leading to a significant relationship (R-2 = 0.47 on validation data) with reasonable error levels (< 25% rRMSE). The increasing availability of VHSR optical sensors (such as from constellations of small satellite platforms) raises the possibility of routine repeated imaging of the world's tropical forests and suggests that texture-based analyses could become an essential tool in international efforts to monitor carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradations (REDD +).

AB The Moderate resolution and Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) level 2 operational aerosol products (MOD04/MYD04), based on the Dark Target (DT) and the enhanced Deep Blue (DB) algorithms, have been providing daily global aerosol information. The MOD04/MYD04 has different data coverage for the DT and the DB algorithms due to differences in their retrieval methods. Recently in the collection 6 (C6), a DT and DB merged (DTBC6) AOD product has been introduced based on different thresholds of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to improve the data coverage. The main objective of this study is to increase the data coverage and reduce the error in the merged DTBC6 AOD product by introducing three new customized methods (DTBMX): (i) DTBM1: "use an average of the DT and DB AOD retrievals or the available one for all the NDVI values", as it is independent of the NDVI values, (ii) DTBM2: "use an average of the DT and DB AOD retrievals or the available one for NDVI >= 0.2, and use the DB retrievals for NDVI < 0.2", and (iii) DTBM3: "use AOD retrievals from the DB algorithm for NDVI NDVI > 0.3, and use an average of the DT and DB retrievals or the available one for NDVI <= 0.3". Validation of the DTBMX is conducted at a global scale from 2004 to 2014 using AERONET AOD measurements from 68 sites located in Asia (9), Europe (22), Southern Africa (8), and North (23) and South America (8), and for comparison purpose, the DTBC6 is evaluated for the same period. Results showed that the number of coincident observations of the DTBMX methods compared to the DTBC6 is increased by 31%, 41% 30%, and 108% for Asian, European, Southern African, and North and South American sites, respectively. At global scale, the number of coincident observations are increased for the DTBM1, DTBM2, and DTBM3 from 29,088 for DTBC6, to 45,937, 45,028, 37,393 which are 58%, 57%, and 29%, respectively more than the for DTBC6 observations. For an equal number of coincident observations, the percentage of retrievals within the EE is increased by between 17% to 20% and the RMSE is decreased by up to 15% for the DTBMX methods, but R is the same as for the DTBC6. The percentage above the EE is also decreased by between 43% to 55% due to greater contribution of the DB retrievals. Overall, the performance of all the DTBMX methods is much better than the DTBC6, but the DTBM1 is the most robust as it is independent of NDVI values, and significantly increases the data coverage. Therefore, it can be used operationally for global merged AOD retrievals. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To determine aerosol optical thickness, AOT, and other geophysical parameters describing conditions in the atmosphere and at the earth's surface by inversion of remote sensing measurements from space based instrumentation, it is necessary to separate ground scenes into cloud free and cloudy or cloud contaminated. Identifying the presence of cloud in a ground scene and establishing an accurate and adequate cloud mask is a challenging task. In this study, measurements by the European Space Agency (ESA) MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) have been used to develop a cloud identification and cloud mask algorithm for preprocessing prior to application of the new algorithm called eXtensible Bremen AErosol Retrieval (XBAER), which retrieves AOT. The new XBAER cloud identification and cloud mask algorithm is called XBAER-CM. This uses thresholds of the reflectance and reflectance ratios measured by MERIS at Top Of Atmosphere (TOA). In this study the parameters used to determine the presence of cloud in ground scenes are i) the brightness of the scenes, ii) the homogeneity or variability of the radiance and iii) cloud height or altitude information. The threshold values used to identify the presence of cloud are selected by using accurate radiative transfer modeling with different surface and atmospheric scenarios. A histogram analysis has been used for different cloud (thin, thick, two-layers, aerosol contaminated cloud), aerosol (dust and biomass burning) and surface scenarios (vegetation, urban, desert and water). Additionally, a snow/ice detection algorithm has been adapted from MerIs Cloud fRation fOr Sciamachy (MICROS) algorithm.
   A validation for the resulting cloud mask data products has been undertaken. This comprised i) comparison of regions scenes, which have beenmanually generated by experts and ii) more global comparisonwith cloud identification data products from surface synoptic observations (SYNOP) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). As a part of verification and validation, the XBAER-CM results have been shown to be in good agreement with the "manually"-created masks, considered to be the true reference for a set of challenging scenarios. The overall accuracy compared with SYNOP and CALIOP are 84.4% and 83.2%, respectively. The XBAER-CM data product is a standalone data product but valuable for use with algorithms, which retrieve other cloud, aerosol and surface parameters from the measurements of MERIS and the follow on instruments such as Sentinel 3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) now in space.

AB Monitoring surface soil moisture (SSM) variability is essential for understanding hydrological processes, vegetation growth, and interactions between land and atmosphere. Due to sparse distribution of in-situ soil moisture networks, over the last two decades, several active and passive radar satellite missions have been launched to provide information that can be used to estimate surface conditions and subsequently soil moisture content of the upper few cm soil layers. Some recent studies reported the potential of satellite altimeter backscatter to estimate SSM, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. They also pointed out some difficulties of such technique including: (i) the noisy behavior of the backscatter estimations mainly caused by surface water in the radar foot-print, (ii) the assumptions for converting altimetry backscatter to SSM, and (iii) the need for interpolating between the tracks.
   In this study, we introduce a new inversion framework to retrieve soil moisture information from along-track altimetry measurements. First, 20Hz along-track nadir radar backscatter is estimated by post-processing waveforms from Jason-2 (Ku-and C-Band during 2008-2014) and Envisat (Ku-and S-Band during 2002-2008). This provides backscatter measurements every similar to 300m along-track within every similar to 10 days from Jason, and every similar to 35days from Envisat observations. Empirical orthogonal base-functions (EOFs) are then derived from soil moisture simulations of a hydrological model, and used as constraints within the inversion. Finally, along-track altimetry reconstructed surface soil moisture (ARSSM) storage is inverted by fitting these EOFs to the altimeter backscatter. The framework is tested in arid and semiarid Western Australia, for which a high resolution hydrological model (the Australian Water Resource Assessment, AWRA model) is available. Our ARSSM products are also validated against Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L3 products, for which maximum correlation coefficients of bigger than 0.8 are found. Our results also indicate that ARSSM can validate the simulation of hydrological models at least at seasonal time scales. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The relationship between impervious land cover and tree development is an important component to understanding urban ecological systems. While impervious surfaces are associated with degraded soil conditions, rerouted hydrological networks and urban microclimates, the overall impact of these effects on tree development is highly variable. This study examines this relationship at two spatial scales: within the individual tree's local environment and across the broad-scale urban landscape. Using a fusion of airborne hyperspectral imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, a 1.0 m spatial resolution classified land cover map (accuracy of 88.6%) was produced for the city of Surrey, British Columbia, Canada, from which landscape imperviousness was then derived. The stem heights of 1914 trees were estimated from the LiDAR data, to which species-specific height models were fit using planting dates recorded by city authorities. Having accounted for the age of the trees, the residuals from these models (i.e.: the difference between modelled and measured height) were then used as indicators of tree development. When aggregated to 0.5 km(2) spatial units, negative relationships (r(2) between 0.292 and 0.753) were found between height model residuals and the degree of land cover imperviousness. These relationships did not persist when examined at the individual tree level, for which imperviousness was measured within the direct vicinity of each tree using the same imperviousness map. We conclude that, using this approach, imperviousness does not appear to be a significant driver of tree height variation, with broad-scale relationships likely due to correlations with other environmental variables associated with the urban-rural gradient. Despite some limitations, the integration of hyperspectral and LiDAR data proved to be a powerful tool for mapping imperviousness, with LiDAR metrics being particularly important for distinguishing between types of urban land cover.

AB Since 2008, macroalgal blooms of Ulva prolifera (also called green tides) occurred every summer in the Yellow Sea (YS), causing environmental and economic problems. A number of studies have used satellite observations to estimate the severity of the blooms through estimating the bloom size and duration. However, a critical bloom parameter, namely biomass, has never been objectively determined due to lack of measurements. In this study, laboratory experiments were conducted to measure U. prolifera biomass (wet weight) per unit area and the corresponding spectral reflectance, through which a robust relationship has been established to link biomass per area to the reflectance-based floating algae index (FAI). The lab-based model has been validated with in situ measurements, with an estimated relative uncertainty of < 16% for algae with FAI values < 0.2 (corresponding to 2 Icg/m(2) biomass and accounting for > 99.5% of the algae-containing pixels in satellite images). The model was further transferred to MODIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc), where aerosol impacts on the model were simulated under various atmospheric conditions. The simulations showed an average of 6.5% (up to 12.3% for the extreme case) uncertainties in biomass estimates when MODIS R-rc data were used as the model inputs. The dry biomass per wet biomass and carbon and nitrogen contents per dry biomass were also determined through lab experiments, thus making their estimation possible from MODIS R-rc data. The model was then applied to time-series of MODIS observations over the YS between 2008 and 2015 to determine the inter-annual variability of these critical parameters. Results showed maximum daily biomass of > 1.7 million tons during June 2015 and minimum daily biomass of < 0.09 million tons during 2012. The ability to estimate U. prolifera biomass at given locations from the near real-time MODIS images is expected to significantly enhance the capacity of an existing monitoring system to provide quantitative information for decision making. 2017 The Authors.

AB Atmospheric water vapor plays an important role in hydrologic cycle and climate change of the Earth. A number of studies have focused on retrieval of the total precipitable water (TPW) using microwave or optical remote sensing. In this paper, the global quarter-degree gridded TPW over land was retrieved using water vapor sensitivity parameter Delta Tb-18.7/Delta Tb-23.8 based on the combination of AMSR-E and MODIS observations. There are two major improvements in the retrieval algorithm, including optimization of the estimation model of surface emissivity Delta epsilon(18.7)/Delta epsilon(23.8) and correction of the terrain influence to the retrieval of TPW using DEM. To obtain a high resolution TPW, we also developed an algorithm to downscale the retrieved quarter-degree gridded TPW to a fine scale of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees using DEM and NDVI. In addition, the downscaled TPW was further calibrated using high precision TPW from MODIS in the clear-sky condition to improve its accuracy. Finally, both quarter-degree and 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded TPW were validated against SuomiNet GPS retrieved TPW on a global scale. The RMSE for the retrieved quarter-degree gridded global TPW is 3.45 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. In addition, the RMSE for the downscaled 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees gridded global TPW is 4.18 mm, with a correlation coefficient of 0.95. An obvious advantage of our algorithm compared with MODIS TPW product is that it can retrieve TPW under cloudy sky condition over land. The algorithm developed in this study can be easily transferred to AMSR2 on board GCOM-W1 and provides the long-term global daily TPW over land since the launch of Aqua to present day to support hydrologic cycle and climate change studies.

AB The Middle and Lower Yangtze River (MLY) basin holds the most freshwater in East Asia; however, the conditions of basin-scale water turbidity remain unknown. In this work, a remote sensing algorithm was developed to estimate the concentrations of the total suspended sediments (TSS) in large lakes and reservoirs over the MLY basin and was based on a band ratio between 555 nm and 645 nm of the atmospherically corrected surface reflectance of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In situ samples used to calibrate the algorithm were collected from 58 lakes and reservoirs with a TSS range of 1 to 300 mg L-1, and the uncertainty of this algorithm was 30-40%. The algorithm was subsequently applied to a total of 102 lakes and reservoirs located in the MLY basin to derive TSS maps from 2000 to 2014 at a 250 m spatial resolution, and the first comprehensive document of the TSS distributions and dynamics of large inland waters of the MLY basin was created. The seasonal patterns among the selected water bodies were similar, with the largest TSS concentrations occurring in the first and fourth quarters in a year and the lowest values occurring in the third quarter. In contrast, spatial heterogeneities were revealed by the 15-year long-term mean TSS climatology information. Although most lakes downstream of Poyang Lake were turbid with 15-year TSS climatology values of 45-100 mg L-1, waters between Poyang and Doting Lake were relatively clearer with TSS climatology values of 15-45 mg L-1, and the clearest waters (<15 mg L-1) were found in reservoirs. The turbidity of 64.5% (e.g., 49/76) for lakes in Class II exhibited a decreasing trend over the 15-year period, and the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) and Dongting Lake in Class I also showed significant TSS declines. Analysis with meteorological data shows that the intra-annual variations appear to be significantly correlated with local precipitation, with a time lag of two months for TSS. The prominent TSS decreasing trend of the lakes in Class,II was probably linked to the significant NDVI increase in the MLY basin, whereas the TSS decrease in the TGR and Dongting Lake is likely to be attributed to the impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. The TSS environmental data record (EDR) of large inland waters presented in this study serves as an important reference for future water quality monitoring and evaluation in the MLY and in China.

AB Long-term observations of surface elevation change of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is of utmost importance when assessing the state of the ice sheet. Satellite radar altimetry offers a long time series of data over the GrIS, starting with ERS-1 in 1991. ESA's Cryosat-2 mission, launched in 2010, provides an invaluable radar altimetry dataset for monitoring the current changes of the ice sheets due to its dense spatial and temporal coverage of these areas. Here, we investigate the effects of including different parameters which describe the shape of the return radar waveform (waveform parameters) in the elevation change algorithm, to correct for temporal changes in the ratio between surface- and volume-scatter in Cryosat-2 observations. We present elevation and volume changes for the Greenland ice sheet in the period from 2010 until 2014. The waveform parameters considered here are the backscatter coefficient, and the leading edge width, which are both available in the ESA Cryosat-2 Level-2i data product. Investigations into relocation of radar reflection points are also included.
   Inter-comparison of the Cryosat-2 derived elevation changes with those derived from Operation IceBridge laser data suggests waveform parameters to be applicable for correcting for changes in volume scattering. The best results in the Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometric mode area of the GrIS are found when applying only the backscatter correction, whereas the best result in the Low Resolution Mode area is obtained by only applying a leading edge width correction. Using this approach to correct for the scattering properties, a volume loss of -292 +/- 38 km(3) yr(-1) is found for the GrIS for the time span November 2010 until November 2014. The inclusion of waveform parameter corrections and improved relocation for the GrIS, helps to reconcile the satellite-derived elevation changes with those observed by Operation IceBridge. However, the bias of temporal changes in the scattering horizons of Cryosat-2 is not entirely removed and suggests that future improvements could be made by including climate data and/or additional waveform parameters to make additional corrections in the Cryosat-2 radar altimetry.

AB Monitoring forest ecosystems requires accurate and up-to-date information on the type and extent of forest depletions, which may exist but are not always open and transparent. The ever growing, freely accessible Landsat archive provides data to derive such information; however, the manipulation of raw imagery can constitute a barrier to those lacking remote sensing expertise. The Landsat-based, global dataset of annual forest loss (version 1.0, Hansen et al., 2013) makes such information readily available. While the accuracy of this dataset has been assessed at the global scale, its applicability for reliable local monitoring of forest harvesting has not yet been validated. Here we undertake such an exercise in a temperate forest in Atlantic Canada. We used a census, polygon based approach to comprehensively assess thematic, temporal and structural accuracy. We vectorized Hansen's forest loss raster for the 8,520 km(2) of public lands in the Miramichi River basin (13,496 km(2)), which yielded 9299 polygons of 1 ha minimum size. Then we used the provincial forest harvest inventory as reference. User's and producer's accuracies were 81% and 82% based on area, and 86% and 85% based on polygon counts. Detection probability decreased with decreasing cutblock size and harvest intensity. From all Hansen polygons, 85% had the correct harvest year and 88% structurally matched one or more reference polygons either alone or together with other Hansen polygons. After the validation, we used the Hansen dataset to derive trends for the entire basin. Mean annual harvest rate was 0.92 ha/km(2)/year between 2000 and 2012. Most of the catchments around the western headwaters of the Miramichi River underwent intensive harvesting, underscoring the need of further monitoring. Our results indicate that the Hansen dataset could be used as a surrogate harvest layer for temperate forests where clear-cutting is common and fire is rare.

AB The main motivation of this paper is to shed new light on the problem of spatial identification of urban and rural areas globally, and to provide a compatible disaggregation framework for linking associated country-specific, non-spatial data compilations, such as building type inventories. Existing homogeneously set-up global urban extent models commonly ignore local-level specifics. While global consistency and regional comparability of urban characteristics are much strived-for goals in the global development and remote sensing communities, non-conformity at the national level often renders such models inapplicable for effective decision-making. Furthermore, the focus on identifying 'urban' leads to an ill-defined 'rural', which is simply defined by contrast as 'everything else'; a questionable definition when referring to strongly spatially localized residential patterns. In this paper we introduce the novel TURBAN geospatial modeling approach, identifying Urban-Rural patterns in Built-up-Adjusted and Nationally-adaptive manner. The model operates at global scale, but at the same time conforms to country specifics. In this model, high-resolution, satellite-derived, built-up data is used to consistently detect global human settlements at unprecedented spatial detail. In combination with global gridded population data, and with reference to national level statistical information on urban population ratios globally compiled in the annually -released UN World Urbanization Prospects, TURBAN identifies matching urban extents. Additionally, a novel reallocation algorithm is introduced which addresses the poor representation of rural areas that is inherent in existing global population grids. Associating all of the population with inhabitable, built-up area and conforming to national urban-rural ratios, iURBAN sets a new standard by enabling careful consideration of both urban and rural as opposed to traditional urban-biased approaches.

AB In this study, we evaluate various methods for estimating the above-ground biomass (AGB) of alpine grassland vegetation using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices, in combination with long-term climate and grassland monitoring data collected at 15 site-specific stations, in the pastoral area of southern Qinghai Province (i.e., the Three-River Headwaters Region) of China. The results show that (1) over the past 12 years, there were considerable spatial variations in the grassland AGB and NDVI, with the average AGB in the peak period of grassland growth in the range of 329-3653 kg DW/ha, corresponding to an average NDVI of 0.25-0.72; (2) Grassland AGB is affected by various factors, such as geographic location, topography, climate, soil, and grass types. Single-factor AGB models only account for 15-49% of the variations in the grassland AGB during the peak period of grass growth, with NDVI-based AGB model to be the best (46%) among all linear remote sensing models we tested; and (3) although the multi-factor model (based on latitude, longitude, and grass cover and height) performs the best (70%) in estimating the AGB, it is not possible for operation due to the current difficulty of grass height modeling. The alternative and operational multi-factor model f(x,y,c) (latitude, longitude, and grass cover) can achieve reasonable estimation of AGB (63%), with the grass cover modeled from the MODIS reflectance, which would be further improved in conjunction with unmanned aerial vehicle technology in the future. Using this model f(x,y,c), the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of AGB estimation is reduced by 20% (i.e., 151 kg DW/ha) as compared with the best single-factor model based on the NDVI (RMSE of 887 kg DW/ha).

AB The concept of light use efficiency (s) and the concept of fraction of photosynthetically active ration (PAR) absorbed for vegetation photosynthesis (PSN), i.e., fAPAR(PSN), have been widely utilized to estimate vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP). It has been demonstrated that the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) is empirically related to epsilon. An experimental US Department of Agriculture (USDA) cornfield in Maryland was selected as our study field. We explored the potential of integrating fAPAR(chl) (defined as the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll) and nadir PRI (PRInadir) to predict cornfield daily GPP. We acquired nadir or near-nadir EO-1/Hyperion satellite images that covered the cornfield and took nadir in-situ field spectral measurements. Those data were used to derive the PRInadir and fAPARchi. The fAPARchi is retrieved with the advanced radiative transfer model PROSAIL2 and the Metropolis approach, a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation procedure. We define chlorophyll light use efficiency (epsilon(chl)) as the ratio of vegetation GPP as measured by eddy covariance techniques to PAR absorbed by chlorophyll (epsilon(chl) = GPP/APAR(chl)). Daily epsilon(chl) retrieved with the EO-1 Hyperion images was regressed with a linear equation of PRInadir (epsilon(chl) = alpha x PRInadir + beta). The satellite CchlPRI(nadir) linear relationship for the cornfield was implemented to develop an integrated daily GPP model [GPP = (alpha x PRInadir P) x fAPAR(chl) x PAR], which was evaluated with fAPAR(chl) and PRInadir retrieved from field measurements. Daily GPP estimated with this fAPAR(chl)-PRInadir integration model was strongly correlated with the observed tower in-situ daily GPP (R-2 = 0.93); with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.71 g C mot(-1) PPFD and coefficient of variation (CV) of 16.57%. Both seasonal epsilon(chl) and PRInadir were strongly correlated with fAPAR(chl) retrieved from field measurements, which indicates that chlorophyll content strongly affects seasonal Echi and PRInadir. We demonstrate the potential capacity to monitor GPP with space-based visible through shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometers such as NASA's soon to be decommissioned EO-1/Hyperion and the future Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRl).

AB California's Central Valley grows a significant fraction of grapes used for wine production in the United States. With increasing vineyard acreage, reduced water availability in much of California, and competing water use interests, it is critical to be able to monitor regional water use and evapotranspiration (ET) over large areas, but also in detail at individual field scales to improve water management within these viticulture production systems. This can be achieved by integrating remote sensing data from multiple satellite systems with different spatiotemporal characteristics. In this research, we evaluate the utility of a multi-scale system for monitoring ET as applied over two vineyard sites near Lodi, California during the 2013 growing season, leading into the drought in early 2014. The system employs a multi-sensor satellite data fusion methodology (STARFM: Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflective Fusion Model) combined with a multi-scale ET retrieval algorithm based on the Two Source Energy Balance (TSEB) land-surface representation to compute daily ET at 30 m resolution. In this system, TSEB is run using thermal band imagery from the Geostationary Environmental Operational Satellites (GOES; 4 km spatial resolution, hourly temporal sampling), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (1 km resolution, daily acquisition) and the new Landsat 8 satellite (sharpened to 30 m resolution, similar to 16 day acquisition). Estimates of daily ET generated in two neighboring fields of Pinot noir vines of different age agree with ground-based flux measurements acquired in-field during most of the 2013 season with relative mean absolute errors on the order of 19-23% (root mean square errors of approximately 1 mm d(-1)), reducing to 14-20% at the weekly timestep relevant for irrigation management (similar to 5 mm wk(-1)). A model overestimation of ET in the early season was detected in the younger vineyard, perhaps relating to an inter-row grass cover crop. Spatial patterns of cumulative ET generally correspond to measured yield maps and indicate areas of variable crop moisture, soil condition, and yield within the vineyards that could require adaptive management. The results suggest that multi-sensor remote sensing observations provide a unique means for monitoring crop water use and soil moisture status at field-scales over extended growing regions, and may have value in supporting operational water management decisions in vineyards and other high value crops.

AB Satellite-based remote sensing data have been widely used in estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations as it can provide spatially detailed information. Most modern satellite-based PM2.5 estimates use statistical models that demand dense PM2.5 monitoring networks. As the national PM2.5 monitoring networks in China were not finished until the end of 2012, the research related to PM2.5 is relatively unsubstantial. To further improve the accuracy and application of remote sensing based estimation models for PM2.5 and take advantage of the newly established networks, we employed a time fixed effects regression model and geographically weighted regression model to develop a spatiotemporal statistical model that estimated ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. The time fixed effects regression model used the aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) instrument as the major predictive variable along with several other dependent variables, including some factors uncommonly discussed in previous literature, i.e., the satellite-derived NO2 concentrations of the previous day (NO2_Lag) and four directional wind vectors, and estimated day-by-day ground-level PM2.5 surfaces. The geographically weighted regression model used the residuals from the time fixed effects regression model as the dependent variable and the AOD value as the independent variable. Through adding the estimated residuals back to previous surfaces, we obtained the final prediction maps of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei with a spatial resolution of 6 km x 6 km. The results were as follows. i). The spatiotemporal statistical model performed satisfactorily in that it successfully captured both the temporal and spatial variations in the PM2.5-AOD relationships. The coefficient of determination (R-2), mean prediction error (MPE), and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 0.88301, 8.1331 mu g/m(3), and 13.0574 mu g/m(3), respectively, during model fitting and 0.71889, 12.2712 mu g/m(3), and 19.2927 mu g/m(3), respectively, during model validation. ii). Incorporating the NO2_Lag in the time fixed effects regression model significantly improved the model's performance and it played a positive role in ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. Replacing the simple wind speed with four directional wind vectors was helpful for the model's performance. iii). Meteorological factors and land use characteristics significantly affected the PM2.5-AOD relationships. The temperature and surface relative humidity (SRH) played a positive role, whereas the rainfall, planet boundary layer height (PBLH), average relative humidity in the PBLH (RH_PBLH), four directional wind vectors, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) played a negative role. iv). The prediction maps revealed that fine particle pollution in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei is severe and the pollution pattern presents relatively strong seasonal heterogeneity and southeast-northwest spatial heterogeneity.

AB Forests provide critical ecosystem services that ensure the sustainability of the environment and society. To manage forests on large scales, spatially explicit gridded data that describes the characteristics of these forests over the entire study area are required. There have been multiple efforts to create such data on regional and global scales. This type of gridded spatially explicit data on forest characteristics are typically done by integrating terrestrial forest inventory (NFI) and satellite-based remotely sensed data. Many studies that incorporate remotely sensed data and forest inventory data often directly compare pixels to inventory plots. The standard resolution of 0.0083 degrees is typically used to integrate these two types of data sets. There is an assumption that, when producing gridded data sets incorporating forest inventory data, the finer the resolution the better the information. This assumption may seem intuitive, however at this resolution, in Europe, each 0.0083 degrees cell has on average 1 NFI plot, which results in a sample with 0 degrees of freedom that represents 0.02% of the cell area. In this study, we challenge this assumption and we quantify the optimal resolution with which to compare and combine remotely sensed and NFI data from the largest collated and harmonized NFI data set in Europe including 196,434 plots. We determined that aggregating data with an original resolution of 0.0083 degrees to between 0.0664 degrees and 0266 degrees (or x 8 to x 32) produces the best agreement between these two forest inventory and remotely sensed data sets, and the lowest standard error in NFI data, and maintains the majority of the local-level spatial heterogeneity.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is known to relate directly to leaf and canopy scale photosynthesis. Retrieving SIF from space can thus provide an indication on the temporal and spatial patterns of the terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). Recent studies have successfully demonstrated the serendipitous retrieval of SIF from satellite remote sensing instruments originally destined to atmospheric studies. However, the finest spatial resolution achieved by these products is 0.5 degrees, which remains too coarse for many applications, including the early detection of drought impacts on vegetation and the integration with ground GPP measurements from flux towers. This paper proposes a methodology to spatially disaggregate the information contained within each coarse SIF pixels by using a non-linear model based on the concept of light use efficiency (LUE). The strategy involves the aggregation of high-resolution (0.05 degrees) remote sensing biophysical variables to calibrate the downscaling model locally and independently at each time step, which can then be applied to non-aggregated data to create a new layer, denoted SIF*, with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees. A global SIF* dataset is generated by applying this methodology globally to 7 years of monthly GOME-2 SIF data. SIP is shown to be a better proxy for GPP than the original coarse spatial resolution product according to flux-tower eddy covariance measurements. Its performance is comparable to dedicated GPP products despite that (unlike SIF*) these are calibrated based on the same flux towers, driven by meteorological data and not hampered by the large noise caused by the SIF retrieval. To further illustrate the added-value of the global SIF* product, this paper also presents: (1) an ecosystem level assessment showing a considerable reduction of noise with respect to the original SIF; (2) a spatio-temporal inter comparison with existing GPP products; and (3) estimations of global terrestrial productivity per selected vegetation types based on SIF*.

AB On August 29, 2014, a lava eruption commenced in the Holuhraun plain, north-east of the Baroarbunga caldera in Iceland. The eruption ended on February 27, 2015, thus lasting for a period of about 6 months. During these months the magma chamber below the caldera gradually deflated, feeding the eruption and causing the rare event of a slow caldera collapse. In this scenario, TanDEM-X remote sensing data are of particular interest. By producing medium-high resolution and accurate elevation models of the caldera, it is possible to evaluate volume losses and topographical changes to increase the knowledge about the ongoing activity. In particular, five TanDEM-X bistatic acquisitions have been commanded between August 01, 2014 and November 08, 2014, two of them before the volcanic eruption and three of them during the event. Additionally, to fully cover the volcanic activity, the lava field 48 km north-east of the caldera has also been monitored. In the first part of the paper, the expected elevation accuracy is studied on two levels. Absolute and relative height accuracies are analyzed by inspecting the X-band signal propagation into snow and by investigating the impact of the main geometrical system parameters and the local geomorphology. In the second part of the paper, the analysis is applied to the Baroarbunga volcanic system, including a validation performed using complementary altimeter data. The main geophysical outcome is the accurate temporal height tracking of the entire caldera and the glacial volcanic system. The measured volume loss at the caldera location is about 1 billion cubic meters in two months with an average rate of subsidence of nearly 50 cm/day. These numbers confirm other independent sources and can be compared to lava volume measurements. Finally, the last segment of the dyke that propagated from the Baroarbunga caldera to the Holuhraun lava field is mapped and a graben structure with a width of up to 1 km and a sinking of a few meters is reported.

AB The latitudinal gradient of the start of the growing season (SOS) and the end of the growing season (EOS) were quantified in Alaska (61 degrees N to 71 degrees N) using satellite-based and ground-based datasets. The Alaskan evergreen needleleaf forests are sparse and the understory vegetation has a substantial impact on the satellite signal. We evaluated SOS and EOS of understory and tundra vegetation using time-lapse camera images. From the comparison of three SOS algorithms for determining SOS from two satellite datasets (SPOT-VEGETATION and Terra-MODIS), we found that the satellite-based SOS timing was consistent with the leaf emergence of the forest under story and tundra vegetation. The ensemble average of SOS over all satellite algorithms can be used as a measure of spring leaf emergence for understory and tundra vegetation. In contrast, the relationship between the ground-based and satellite-based EOSs was not as strong as that of SOS both for boreal forest and tundra sites because of the large biases between those two EOSs (19 to 26 days). The satellite-based EOS was more relevant to snowfall events than the senescence of understory or tundra. The plant canopy radiative transfer simulation suggested that 84-86% of the NDVI seasonal amplitude could be a reasonable threshold for the EOS determination. The latitudinal gradients of SOS and EOS evaluated by the satellite and ground data were consistent and the satellite derived SOS and EOS were 3.5 to 5.7 days degree(-1) and -2.3 to -2.7 days degree(-1), which corresponded to the spring (May) temperature sensitivity of -2.5 to -3.9 days degrees C-1 in SOS and the autumn (August and September) temperature sensitivity of 3.0 to 4.6 days degrees C-1 in EOS. This demonstrates the possible impact of phenology in spruce forest understory and tundra ecosystems in response to climate change in the warming Artic and sub-Arctic regions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB To answer new scientific and ecological questions and monitor multiple forest changes, a fine scale characterization of these ecosystems is needed, and could imply the mapping of specific species, of detailed forest types, and of functional composition. This characterization can be now provided by the novel Earth Observation tools. This study aims to contribute to understanding the innovation in forest and ecological research that can be brought in by advanced remote sensing instruments, and proposes the guild mapping approach as a tool to efficiently monitor the varied tropical forest resources. We evaluated, in tropical Ghanaian forests, the ability of airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral Sentinel-2 data, and derived vegetation indices and textures, to: distinguish between two different forest types; to discriminate among selected dominant species; and to separate trees species grouped according to their functional guilds: Pioneer, Non Pioneer Light Demanding, and Shade Bearer. We then produced guild classification maps for each area using hyperspectral data. Our results showed that with both hyperspectral and simulated Sentinel-2 data these discrimination tasks can be successfully accomplished. Results also stressed the importance of texture features, especially if using the lower spectral and spatial Sentinel-2 resolution data, and highlighted the important role of the new Sentinel-2 data for ecological monitoring. Classification results showed a statistically significant improvement in overall accuracy using Support Vector Machine, over Maximum Likelihood approach. We proposed the functional guilds mapping as an innovative approach to: (i) monitor compositional changes, especially with respect to the effects of global climate change on forests, and particularly in the tropical biome where the occurrence of hundreds of species prevents mapping activities at species level; (ii) support large-scale forest inventories. The imminent Sentinel-2 data could serve to open the road for the development of new concepts and methods in forestry and ecological research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing size and abundance of lianas relative to trees are pervasive changes in Neotropical forests that may lead to reduced forest carbon stocks. Yet the liana growth form is chronically understudied in large-scale tropical forest censuses, resulting in few data on the scale, cause, and impact of increasing lianas. Satellite and airborne remote sensing provide potential tools to map and monitor lianas at much larger spatial and rapid temporal scales than are possible with plot-based forest censuses. We combined high-resolution airborne imaging spectroscopy and a ground-based tree canopy census to investigate whether tree canopies supporting lianas could be discriminated from tree canopies with no liana coverage. Using support vector machine algorithms, we achieved accuracies of nearly 90% in discriminating the presence-absence of lianas, and low error (15.7% RMSE) when predicting liana percent canopy cover. When applied to the full image of the study site, our model had a 4.1% false-positive error rate as validated against an independent plot-level dataset of liana canopy cover. Using the derived liana cover classification map, we show that 6.1%-10.2% of the 1823 ha study site has high-to-severe (50-100%) liana canopy cover. Given that levels of liana infestation are increasing in Neotropical forests and can result in high tree mortality, the extent of high-to-severe liana canopy cover across the landscape may have broad implications for ecosystem function and forest carbon storage. The ability to accurately map landscape-scale liana infestation is crucial to quantifying their effects on forest function and uncovering the mechanisms underlying their increase.

AB Pastoralist households across East Africa face major livestock losses during drought periods that can cause persistent poverty. For Kenya and southern. Ethiopia, an existing index insurance scheme aims to reduce the adverse effects of such losses. The scheme insures individual households through an area-aggregated seasonal forage scarcity index derived from remotely-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series. Until recently, insurance contracts covered animal losses and indemnity payouts were consequently made late in the season, based on a forage scarcity index incorporating both wet and dry season NDVI data. Season timing and duration were fixed for the whole area (March-September for long rains, October-February for short rains). Due to demand for asset protection insurance (pre-loss intervention) our aim was to identify earlier payout options by shortening the temporal integration period of the index. We used 250 m-resolution 10-day NDVI composites for 2001-2014 from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). To better describe the period during which forage develops, we first retrieved per-pixel average season start- and end-dates using a phenological model. These dates were averaged per insurance unit to obtain unit-specific growing period definitions. With these definitions a new forage scarcity index was calculated. We then examined if shortening the temporal period further could effectively predict most (>90%) of the interannual variability of the new index, and assessed the effects of shortening the period on indemnity payouts. Our analysis shows that insurance payouts could be made one to three months earlier as compared to the current index definition, depending on the insurance unit. This would allow pastoralists to use indemnity payments to protect their livestock through purchase of forage, water, or medicines. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forest ecosystems in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California are greatly influenced by wildfire as a natural disturbance, and increased fire severity and drought occurrence may alter the course of post-fire recovery in these ecosystems. We examined effects of fire severity, post-fire climate, and topographic factors on short-term (<5 years) vegetation recovery in mixed-conifer and red fir forests in the Sierra Nevada. We hypothesized that short-term vegetation recovery patterns would be different among patches with varying fire severity, especially between low-moderate and high severity patches, and that post-fire climate would have differing impacts on short-term vegetation recovery in different ecological zones (lower montane forest vs. upper montane forest). 30-meter Landsat time series stacks were used to monitor short-term vegetation recovery following wildfire in mixed-conifer and red fir forest types. Changes in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) following thirty-five fires (>405 ha) between 1999 and 2006 were examined. According to the modeling results provided by ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions including spatial variation coefficients, fire severity, post-fire wet eason precipitation, post-fire January minimum temperature, and topographic factors explain variations in short-term post-fire NDVI values (adjusted R-squared = [0.680, 0.688] for red fir forests; adjusted R-squared = [0.671, 0.678] for mixed-conifer forests). The modeling results indicated that burned mixed-conifer forest was sensitive to post-fire drought, while burned red fir forest, with higher summer soil moisture availability, was sensitive to post-fire temperature. We also found that differences in recovery related to fire severity disappeared more quickly in burned mixed-conifer forest than in burned red fir forest. Future efforts should focus on long-term recovery, including competition between forest and shrub species in previously burned areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we used the Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DISPATCH) algorithm under very wet soil conditions in Western Canada for the disaggregation of coarse resolution 40-km soil moisture derived from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. The algorithm relies on the Soil Evaporative Efficiency (SEE), which was estimated using the 1-km resolution data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectoradiometer (MODIS). The study aimed to: (i) evaluate DISPATCH under wet soil conditions, (ii) test the linearity/non-linearity of the relationship between soil moisture and SEE, and (iii) propose a more robust procedure to calibrate the SEE model under very wet soil conditions. The disaggregated soil moisture values were compared to 0-5 cm in situ measurements and the soil moisture derived from the L-MEB (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) model from airborne brightness temperature at 1.4 GHz collected during the Canadian Experiment for Soil Moisture in 2010 (CanEx-SM10) field campaign. The results show a correlation between 0.7 and 0.8 and bias values similar to 0 m(3)/m(3). The DISPATCH algorithm shows better disaggregation results under very wet soil conditions when a non-linear relationship is considered between SEE and soil moisture instead of a linear model. This is mainly due to the small variability of surface temperature inside the area covered by the SMOS pixel under very wet soil conditions, and the difficulty in accurately estimating the maximum soil temperature (Ts-max), which is a driving factor for SEE. A sensitivity analysis was conducted and it shows that the linear model performs well only if Ts-max can be determined more accurately. The possibility to determine Ts-max using high resolution MODIS data over a larger area than the SMOS pixel is examined and discussed in the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Maintaining consistent datasets of Surface Reflectance (SR) is an important challenge to ensure long-term quality of Climate Data Records. The Landsat 5 and 7 archives offer a unique data source to monitor globally the land surface at high spatial resolution. The Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM + SR products, derived from the on-demand processing Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS), require periodic evaluation to check the data consistency. Two evaluation approaches are presented in this paper. The first approach used the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data set for the period 2000 to 2013 over 489 sites with 3600 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM + scenes selected. For each scene, 10 x 10 km subsets of LEDAPS-derived Landsat SR and AERONET-derived SR are compared. The latter are computed using Landsat top of atmosphere reflectance, AERONET measurements of atmospheric parameters, and the 6S radiative transfer model. Second, we introduce a methodology to cross-compare Landsat data and MODIS data acquired on the same day. The analysis is based on 4000 random Landsat scenes globally distributed from 2000 to 2013. This method includes: (i) a surface anisotropy adjustment, based on the VJB Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) method, to adjust Terra and Aqua MODIS data to Landsat 5 and 7 sun-view geometry, (ii) a spectral adjustment based on an artificial neural network trained with the PROSAIL vegetation radiative transfer model, to adjust MODIS data to TM and ETM+ spectral responses.
   The overall results of both approaches show a good match in over 80% of the scenes, i.e. the TM and ETM + SR uncertainty remained within the SR specification, defined as 0.05 x SR + 0.005. The worst results are found in the blue band used in LEDAPS to adjust the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT). The MODIS-Landsat SR cross-comparison confirms the utility of a BRDF adjustment method to decrease the scattering between Landsat sensors and MODIS sensors (Terra and Aqua). The spectral adjustment removes part of the biases related to spectral response differences. Global analysis is used to identify AOT retrieval issues over specific scenes, mostly over bright surfaces. From 2000 to 2013, no significant temporal variation of the performance is detected, which enhanced the consistency of LEDAPS-derived surface reflectance data set. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The spectral reflectance of three soil samples - selected to represent a range of particle size distribution, texture, and drying characteristics-was monitored as the samples progressed from fully saturated to air dry. Band depths of prominent water absorption features in the near and shortwave infrared, centered at 970 nm, 1160 nm, 1440 nm, and 1930 nm, were then compared to the surface water content, with the expectation that this metric would be characteristic of the soil moisture content and be largely independent of soil properties. As expected, the band depths at 970 nm and 1160 nm decreased monotonically as the water content decreased. Unfortunately, these bands were only detectable in the sample consisting of large, reflective particles and large pore spaces (quartz sand). That they were not apparent in the darker soils with smaller particles and pore spaces suggests that these water absorption bands will not be generally useful for observing surface soil moisture. In contrast, the band depths of the 1440 nm and 1930 nm absorption features were very responsive to the water content over the entire drying cycle, providing a strong, but more complex signal, with the band depth initially increasing with decreasing water content before reaching a maximum and finally decreasing late in the drying cycle. The change in band depth at 1930 nm was particularly interesting since it reached a maximum coincident with the transition from constant evaporation rate (stage-1 drying) to a much slower evaporation rate (stage-2 drying) for all three soils. A simple mathematical model suggests that the pattern of change in the band depth is related to the near extinction of light at the band center relative to the band shoulders, which can be related to a specific water optical path length. The maximum absorption band depth at 1930 nm (and the associated water optical path length) appears to coincide with a trace amount of water present in the pore spaces for all three soil samples, which is consistent with the transition in drying rates.

AB Passive microwave remote sensing at L-band has been widely acknowledged as the most promising technique to observe the spatial distribution of near surface (top similar to 5 cm) soil moisture at regional to global scales. The launch of the ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission in 2009 now means that global space-borne brightness temperature observations are available at L-band (1.41 GHz) to estimate soil moisture every 2 to 3 days with a target accuracy of 0.04 m(3)/m(3). Moreover, NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite has been launched on 31st January 2015, also carrying an L-band radiometer, together with an L-band radar for downscaling the brightness temperature observations to better than 10 km resolution. At the SMOS/SMAP radiometer scale of similar to 40 km, the presence of water bodies potentially induces an overestimation of retrieved soil moisture, if not carefully accounted for in retrieval models. Such water fraction effects on brightness temperature and soil moisture retrieval accuracy were investigated in this study, using airborne L-band brightness temperature data collected during three Australian field experiments. The water induced brightness temperature effect and water fraction were compared under different resolutions, sampling days, and land surface conditions, showing that the water fraction impact on retrieved soil moisture is independent of scale, but heavily dependent on the soil water content status. Subsequently, the highest water fraction threshold that can be tolerated in order to achieve the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) target accuracy without correction has been determined as 0.08 (actual range is from 0.02 for dry bare soil to 0.08 for wet vegetated soil). Using a MODIS derived water fraction dataset, the water fraction dynamics were also studied over Australia during the ten years from 2001 to 2010. The results show that if the mean water fraction map was used as a static water map to flag or correct water effects, the water body induced soil moisture retrieval error would have exceeded the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) target more than once for 135% of the Australian land 40 km sized radiometer pixels; only 0.6% Australian land pixels would have exceeded this target with a frequency of 10 times or more per year.

AB Phytoplankton size structure is an important indicator of the state of the pelagic ecosystem. Stimulated by the paucity of in situ observations on size structure, and by the sampling advantages of autonomous remote platforms, new efforts are being made to infer the size-structure of the phytoplankton from oceanographic variables that may be measured at high temporal and spatial resolution, such as total chlorophyll concentration. Largescale analysis of in situ data has revealed coherent relationships between size-fractionated chlorophyll and total chlorophyll that can be quantified using the three-component model of Brewin et al. (2010). However, there are variations surrounding these general relationships. In this paper, we first revise the three-component model using a global dataset of surface phytoplankton pigment measurements. Then, using estimates of the average irradiance in the mixed-layer, we investigate the influence of ambient light on the parameters of the three-component model. We observe significant relationships between model parameters and the average irradiance in the mixed-layer, consistent with ecological knowledge. These relationships are incorporated explicitly into the three-component model to illustrate variations in the relationship between size-structure and total chlorophyll, ensuing from variations in light availability. The new model may be used as a tool to investigate modifications in size-structure in the context of a changing climate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in many ecological studies. The current Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in standard MODIS and ASTER LST products is greater than 1 K, and for ASTER can be as large as 4 K for graybody pixels such as vegetation. Errors of 3 to 8 K have been observed for ASTER in humid conditions, making knowledge of atmospheric water vapor content critical in retrieving accurate LST. For this reason improved accuracy in LST measurements through the synthesis of visible-to-shortwave-infrared (VSWIR) derived water vapor maps and Thermal-Infrared (TIR) data is one goal of the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager, or HyspIRI, mission. The 2011 ER-2 Delano/Lost Hills flights acquired data with both the MODIS/ASTER Simulator (MASTER) and Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instruments flown concurrently. This study compares LST retrieval accuracies from the standard JPL MASTER temperature products produced using the temperature-emissivity separation (TES) algorithm, and the water vapor scaling (WVS) atmospheric correction method proposed for HyspIRI. The two retrieval methods are run both with and without high spatial resolution AVIRIS-derived water vapor maps to assess the improvement from VSWIR synthesis. We find improvement using VSWIR derived water vapor maps, with the WVS method being most accurate overall. For closed canopy agricultural vegetation we observed temperature retrieval RMSEs of 0.49 K and 0.70 K using the WVS method on MASTER data with and without AVIRIS derived water vapor, respectively.

AB Forests play an important role in urban environments by providing a range of ecosystem services. However, forest composition and function in urban ecosystems are ecologically complex because of high heterogeneity of the landscape and long legacies of intensive human management. Accurate quantification and mapping of composition of tree taxa in urban forests using remote sensing require high spatial and spectral resolution imagery. As such, mapping of individual species over large areas is impractical, so instead we map gradients of composition based on canopy traits derived from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) and lidar. This trait-based approach depicts emergent functional overlaps due to pixel-scale mixing of disparate species or genera found in the region. This provides a basis for understanding forest functioning in urban ecosystems where multiple taxa are functionally and spectrally similar. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to ordinate multi-dimensional forest composition data, where NMDS scores (NMDS1 and NMDS2) represent compositional gradients. Predictive models of NMDS1 and NMDS2 were built using AVIRIS-derived foliar traits such as nitrogen concentration and lidar structural variables. Gradients of composition were strongly related to AVIRIS-derived traits (R-2 = 0.67 for NMDS1 and R-2 = 0.47 for NMDS2). Lidar-derived structural variables provided no improvement to prediction of the first NMDS axis estimates, and a minimal improvement (3% more variance explained) on NMDS2. We applied predictive models of NMDS1 and NMDS2 to maps of predictor traits to map NMDS1 and NMDS2. From the NMDS1 and NMDS2 maps, we mapped potential composition patterns and associated uncertainties by genus from the ordination of the field data. Our maps of composition gradients show the potential for data from imaging spectrometers such as HyspIRI to comprehensively characterize the diversity of ecosystems in heterogeneous landscapes. Moderate resolution satellite imagery may not facilitate detection of individual species, but imaging spectroscopy provides a basis to estimate the potential distribution of particular taxa based on assemblages associated with foliar traits that can be derived from imaging spectroscopy. Comprehensive satellite-based mapping will provide basic understanding and spatially explicit information on forest functioning suitable for monitoring and management of urban ecosystems.

AB The first seven bands of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have been used widely for global land-cover/land-use (LCLU) monitoring (e.g., deforestation over the Amazon basin). However, the spatial resolution of MODIS bands 3-7 (i.e., 500 m) is coarser than that of bands 1 and 2 (i.e., 250 m), and may be too coarse for a large number of applications. In this paper, a new geostatistical approach based on area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK) is proposed for downscaling coarse spatial resolution bands 3-7 such as to produce a complete set of MODIS images at 250 m.ATPRK takes advantages of the fine spatial resolution information in bands 1 and 2 by regression modeling, and uses area-to-point kriging to downscale the coarse residuals from the regression. ATPRK was compared to four existing methods, including the principal component analysis, wavelets, high-pass filter and kriging with external drift (RED) methods for downscaling in two experiments on MODIS data from the Brazilian Amazon. Both visual and quantitative evaluations (in terms of the root mean square error, correlation coefficient, relative global-dimensional synthesis error, universal image quality index, spectral angle mapper and spectral information divergence) showed that ATPRK produced sharpened images with the greatest quality. In addition, ATPRK perfectly preserved the spectral properties of the original coarse data and was faster than KED. The results reveal the great potential of ATPRK applied to MODIS data for a wide variety of applications, including global monitoring of deforestation. The ATPRK proposed in this paper is an entirely new image fusion approach based on a new conceptualization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We examine satellite-based measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) over the region impacted by the Russian drought and heat wave of 2010. Like the popular Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) that has been used for decades to measure photosynthetic capacity, SIF measurements are sensitive to the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically-active radiation (fPAR). However, in addition, SIF is sensitive to PAR as well as the fluorescence yield that is related to the photosynthetic yield. Both SIF and NDVI from satellite data show drought-related declines early in the growing season in 2010 as compared to other years between 2007 and 2013 for areas dominated by crops and grasslands. This suggests an early manifestation of the dry conditions on fPAR. Using MODIS fPAR retrievals, we computed SIF/APAR which is related to light use efficiencies (LUEs) for fluorescence and photosynthesis. We found drought-related losses in fluorescence efficiency for all areas including those dominated by mixed forests. Unlike croplands and grasslands, areas of mixed forest did not show significant drought-related declines in fPAR. We also simulated SIF and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) using a global land surface model driven by observation-based meteorological fields. The model provides a reasonable simulation of the drought and heat impacts on SIF in terms of the spatial extents of anomalies, but some differences were found in timing of the peak drought response between modeled and observed SIP. Model data also suggested that drought-related declines in LUE for fluorescence and photosynthesis in areas of mixed forest produce losses in SIF and GPP. SIF and GPP losses due to drought in croplands and grasslands result from both LUE and fPAR reductions. The combination of SIF and NDVI or fPAR data is shown to be an important source of information for evaluating model performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Snow cover pattern and persistence have important implications for planetary energy balance, climate sensitivity to forcings, and vegetation structure, function, and composition. Variability in snow cover within mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest, USA is attributable to a combination of anthropogenic climate change and climate oscillations. However, snow covered areas can be heterogeneous and patchy, requiring more detailed mapping of snow trends to understand their potential influences on montane forests. We used standard daily MODIS snow products (MOD10A1.5) to investigate the 15-year record (2000-2014) of snow cover in the predominant forest ecotone of the Oregon Western Cascades. We modeled the ecotone using field data from the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, and only considered forested MODIS Terra pixels located within the mapped ecotone of a five-county region. Three snow cover metrics were developed using both binary and fractional snow cover data: mean ecotone snow cover percent, number of snow covered days during the melt season, and day of snow disappearance. Snow cover and depletion dates exhibited large interannual variability and no significant linear trends. This variability is likely influenced by the preceding wintertime states of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the El Nino/Southem Oscillation (ENSO), which tend to covary. We improve and generalize existing methods for power analysis of trend estimation and quantify the number of uninterrupted observations of the snow metrics that would be needed to distinguish trends of different magnitudes from noise variance, taking possible autocorrelation into account. Sensitivity analyses of the results to some of our heuristic choices are conducted, and challenges associated with optical remote sensing of snow in a dense montane forest are discussed.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of instrument noise, atmospheric conditions, and reflectance retrieval method on multispectral reflectance and fractional cover estimates derived from spectral mixture analysis. Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance was simulated for pixels with various ground (fractional cover of green vegetation (GV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil) and atmospheric/geometric (solar zenith angle, visibility, and water vapor) conditions for four operational spacebome multispectral images, Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhance Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Instrument noise was added to the TOA radiance. Three reflectance retrieval methods were used to estimate surface reflectance, and fractional cover estimates of GV, NPV, and soil were made using spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). Among atmospheric characteristics, we found that visibility and solar zenith angle made the greatest contributions to spectral and fractional cover error. In all cases, CV fraction was estimated with lower error than NPV or soil fraction. The reflectance retrieval method that provided the best reflectance estimates did not produce the fractional cover estimates with the lowest error due to variable bias across bands. Fractional cover estimates for all ground components were strongly impacted by instrument noise, but MESMA significantly improved fractional cover estimates for NPV and soil, regardless of noise level. This study suggests that there are practical constraints on the level of accuracy that can be attained in multispectral estimates of NPV and soil. A set of recommendations for the use of spectral unmixing of multispectral reflectance data is developed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a statistical method, denoted PROFHMM, to infer the evolution of the vertical profiles of oceanic biogeophysical variables from sea-surface data. This method makes use of discrete Hidden Markov Models whose states are defined through Self-Organizing Topological Maps. The Self-Organizing Topological Maps are used to provide the states of the Hidden Markov Model, as well as improve its parameters. After introducing the general principles of PROFHMM, we present the results obtained in a case study in which the evolution of the vertical profiles of Chlorophyll-a was inverted from sea-surface data. We applied PROFHMM for the reconstruction of the evolution of the vertical distribution of Chlorophyll-a at BATS, by training it on the numerical outputs of the NEMO-PISCES model, and reproducing the evolution of this model by using a sequence satellite observations. We obtained a root mean square error of 0.0399 ng/l for the validation year 2008. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Quantifying the uncertainty of the aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon (C) stock is crucial for understanding the global C cycle and implementing the United Nations Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (UN-REDD). The uncertainty analysis of remotely sensed AGB is tricky because, if validation plots or cross-validation is used for error assessment, the AGB of validation plots does not necessarily represent the actual measurements but estimates of the true AGB. Leveraging a recently published pan-tropical destructively measured tree AGB database, this study proposed a new method of characterizing the uncertainty of the remotely sensed AGB. The method propagates errors from tree- to landscape-level by considering errors in the whole workflow of the AGB mapping process, including allometric model development, tree measurements, tree-level AGB prediction, plot-level AGB estimation, plot-level remote sensing based biomass model development, remote sensing feature extraction, and pixel-level AGB prediction. Applying such a method to the tree AGB mapped using airborne lidar over tropical forests in Ghana, we found that the AGB prediction error is over 20% at 1 ha spatial resolution, larger than the results reported in previous studies for other tropical forests. The discrepancy between our studies and others reflects not only our focus on African tropical forests but also the methodological differences in our uncertainty analysis, especially in the aspect of comprehensively addressing more sources of uncertainty. This study also highlights the importance of considering the plot-level AGB estimate uncertainty when field plots are used to calibrate remote sensing based biomass models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The dinoflagellate Prorocentrum donghaiense (P. donghaiense) is one of the most common species making up harmful algal blooms in the Yangtze River Estuary and the adjacent area of the East China Sea. Based on the differences between the absorption characteristics of P. donghaiense and diatoms from the East China Sea and an extensive in-situ remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) dataset, a multispectral approach for discriminating P. donghaiense blooms from other water types was developed based on MODIS R-rs spectral shape discrimination. The procedure is separated into two steps. First, the bloom waters are identified by the low R-rs(555) and high R-AB owing to their relatively low reflectance and high spectral slope in the green bands. Second, two new indices of P. donghaiense index (PDI) and diatom index (DI) are developed for discriminating P. donghaiense from diatom blooms, based on the distinct spectral differences found in the green and red spectral ranges of phytoplankton absorption between the two algal groups. The validation using observations collected during near-con-current field surveys showed that the application of our practical method to MODIS imagery can provide reliable information on the inferred pattern and spatial distribution of the algal bloom, and that the classification technique for P. donghaiense bloom is considered successful, which may allow coastal mangers to better mitigate the harmful effects of P. donghaiense blooms in the East China Sea.

AB The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which mixing and stratification processes influence the horizontal surface phytoplankton distribution in a tropical hydroelectric reservoir in Brazil. We used a synergistic approach that combines remote sensing bio-optical empirical and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling to represent phytoplankton dynamics. Seasonal differences were evaluated by simulating the bio-optical and the three-dimensional hydrodynamic models for two periods: the austral summer and winter of 2009. The three-dimensional hydrodynamic model simulations showed that the water column was completely mixed during winter; the water column remained stratified during summer. We also noticed a permanent thermocline during the summer between 15 and 25 m in the reservoir. In both seasons, the surface current was wind driven and preferentially directed eastward. The bio-optical model showed that the horizontal surface phytoplankton distribution, as indicated by chlorophyll-a concentration, was heterogeneous during winter and homogenous during summer. Moreover, higher concentrations were observed by the empirical bio-optical model during winter (the highest mean areal concentration was 24 mu g L-1) than in summer (2.1 mu g L-1). This difference was explained by short timescale events, such as cold front passages, which contributed to the proliferation of phytoplankton in winter by enhancing vertical mixing in the water column. Lake number analysis showed that upwelling events were the most common mechanisms driving the mixing process during winter (L-N < 1 82% of the time). Combining remote sensing and three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling makes it possible to more fully analyze the dynamics of the horizontal surface phytoplankton distribution under different meteorological conditions. The two modeling techniques can be used in a complementary manner and serve as an essential tool for the environmental monitoring of aquatic systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Monitoring and understanding the physical, chemical and biological status of global inland waters are immensely important to scientists and policy makers alike. Whereas conventional monitoring approaches tend to be limited in terms of spatial coverage and temporal frequency, remote sensing has the potential to provide an invaluable complementary source of data at local to global scales. Furthermore, as sensors, methodologies, data availability and the network of researchers and engaged stakeholders in this field develop, increasingly widespread use of remote sensing for operational monitoring of inland waters can be envisaged. This special issue on Remote Sensing of Inland Waters comprises 16 articles on freshwater ecosystems around the world ranging from lakes and reservoirs to river systems using optical data from a range of in situ instruments as well as airborne and satellite platforms. The papers variably focus on the retrieval of in-water optical and biogeochemical parameters as well as information on the biophysical properties of shoreline and benthic vegetation. Methodological advances include refined approaches to adjacency correction, inversion-based retrieval models and in situ inherent optical property measurements in highly turbid waters. Remote sensing data are used to evaluate models and theories of environmental drivers of change in a number of different aquatic ecosystems. The range of contributions to the special issue highlights not only the sophistication of methods and the diversity of applications currently being developed, but also the growing international community active in this field. In this introductory paper we briefly highlight the progress that the community has made over recent decades as well as the challenges that remain. It is argued that the operational use of remote sensing for inland water monitoring is a realistic ambition if we can continue to build on these recent achievements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Ocean color remote sensing has been shown to be a useful tool to map turbidity (T) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration in turbid coastal waters. Different algorithms to retrieve T and/or SPM from water reflectance already exist, however there are important questions as to whether these algorithms need to be calibrated specifically for different regions. In the present work the potential generality of a semi-empirical single band turbidity retrieval algorithm using the near infrared (NIR) band at 859 nm in highly turbid waters is assessed. For completeness the use of 645 nm in medium to low turbidity waters is also proposed. Radiative transfer simulations and in situ measurements from various European and South American coastal and shallow estuarine environments characterized by high concentrations of suspended sediments are analyzed. Reflectance and turbidity measurements were performed in the southern North Sea (SNS) and French Guyana (FG) coastal waters, and Scheldt (SC), Gironde (GIR) and Rio de la Plata (RdP) estuaries. Simulations showed that uncertainty for turbidity estimation associated with different particle types and bidirectional effects is typically less than 6%. When applied to field data from the five different sites, the semi-analytical algorithm performed well: turbidity estimates were within 12% and 22% of in situ values. A good performance was also found when the entire database was analyzed (n = 106) with a mean relative error of 13.7% and bias of 4.8%. The good performance of the algorithm for all these regions, despite differences in sediment characteristics, and the results of the radiative transfer simulations suggest the global applicability of the algorithm to map turbidity up to 1000 FNU. Consequently regional algorithms to retrieve SPM concentration from reflectance can be designed by combining this global algorithm to retrieve T from water reflectance with a regional relationship to convert T to SPM. This has the very practical advantage that the measurements needed to calibrate the latter T/SPM conversion for any new region are much easier and cheaper than in situ reflectance measurements.

AB In principle, observations from hyperspectral infrared (IR) sounders such as IASI (infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer) can be used to simultaneously retrieve dust aerosol optical depth (ADD) and properties such as dust particle size, composition, emission temperature and height. Starting from a compilation of "typical" mineral dust particle size distributions and mineralogical compositions, the information content of dust spectra from Mie simulations and from FTIR (Fourier-transform-infrared spectrometer) measurements (provided by the University of Iowa) is analysed. While the Mie spectra provide a higher number of degrees of freedom for signal (up to 6.7) than the FTIR spectra (up to 5.7), the Shannon information content is slightly lower (3.4) from Mie than from FTIR (3.5). The analysis shows that the spectra provide information on particle size and composition, but information about both cannot be extracted independently owing to the correlations between the different spectra. A dust retrieval approach for IASI probing the spectral shape of extinction has been updated using the Mie and FTIR spectra. Dust properties provided by the retrieval algorithm are: AOD (at 0.55 mu m and 10 mu m), effective radius, mass-weighted mean diameter, weight-fractions of mineralogical components, IR single scattering albedo and dust layer effective emission temperature. The retrieval uncertainty in each of these parameters is calculated for each IASI pixel. From the retrieved dust layer temperature the dust layer altitude is also inferred using temperature profiles from the WRF numerical weather prediction model.
   To evaluate the impact of using the Mie and FTIR spectra within the algorithm, AODs determined using each are compared to AERONET and SEVIRI dust observations. This evaluation suggests that the overall performance of the retrieval in terms of AOD is better for the FOR version. Evaluation (of the FTIR version) with AERONET coarse mode AOD shows a correlation of 0.73 with RMSD of 0.18 and bias of -0.07. 85% of IASI AOD retrievals are found to be within +/- 0.2 of AERONET coarse AOD. Evaluating the quality of the other retrieved parameters is more difficult but we find that the values obtained do show a strong dependence on whether the Mie or FTIR spectra are used. For example, using FTIR spectra results in higher spatial variability in the clay fraction of the retrieved dust compared to Mie. Similar sensitivity is seen in the retrieved particle sizes and single scattering albedo. Indeed, assumptions made concerning the absorption properties of the Mie spectra result in the retrieval of unrealistically low dust layer altitudes, while reasonable values are obtained when using FOR spectra. Thus it is important to acknowledge that good AOD agreement with independent validation sources does not automatically imply a similar level of quality in the remaining variables.

AB This short communication describes several previously undocumented processing steps, pixel flagging procedures, and improvements made to the maximum peak height (MPH) algorithm, which is aimed at the operational detection of chlorophyll a (chl-a) and cyanobacteria blooms in inland and near-coastal waters. The improvements reduce false-positive cyanobacteria detection in oligotrophic waters; enable pixels in clear waters affected by environmental radiances (stray light) to be identified; and enhance detection of floating aquatic vegetation. Several case studies from around the globe are used to illustrate these improvements, and demonstrate new pixel flagging procedures and algorithm operation. The algorithm was validated using a large in situ dataset for chl-a from a wide range of inland water types. The MPH chl-a estimates were more stable than the fluorescence line height (FLH) and maximum chlorophyll index (MCI) values. The results demonstrate the potential for using the MPH algorithm, now released as a plug-in for the Basic ENVISAT A(ATSR) and MERE (BEAM) processing toolbox, as a standard product for estimating chl-a (and trophic status) in inland and near-coastal waters using MERIS and the forthcoming Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument.

AB Airborne thermal-infrared (TIR) imaging spectrometry techniques have been used to detect and track methane and other gaseous emissions from a variety of discrete sources in diverse environmental settings, and to enable estimation of the strength of each plume. The high spatial resolution (1-2 m) permits attribution of chemical plumes to their source, while the moderate spectral resolution (44 nm across the 7.5-13.5 mu m TIR band) enables identification and quantification of the gaseous plume constituents, even when one is present in considerably greater concentration than the others. Raw imagery was quantitatively analyzed using matched filtering and adaptive coherence techniques. Experiments under controlled conditions demonstrated successful detection of methane point sources at release rates as low as 2.2 kg/h (similar to 1 dm(3)/s at NTP). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Landslide susceptibility, hazards, and risks have been extensively explored and analyzed in the past decades. However, choosing relevant conditioning factors in such analyses remains a challenging task. Landslide susceptibility mapping employs topological, environmental, geological, and hydrological parameters. Some researchers assume that as the number of conditioning factors increases, the precision of the generated susceptibility map increases. By contrast, other case studies prove that a small number of conditioning factors are sufficient to produce landslide susceptibility maps with a reasonable quality. This study investigates the effects of conditioning factors on landslide susceptibility mapping. Bukit Antarabangsa, Ulu Kiang, Malaysia was selected as the study area, because it is a catchment area with a high potential of landslide occurrence. A spatial database of 31 landslide locations was evaluated to map landslide-susceptible areas. Two datasets of conditioning factors were constructed in GIS environment. The first dataset was derived from high-resolution airborne laser scanning data (LiDAR), which contains eight landslide conditioning factors: altitude, slope, aspect, curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic roughness index (TRI), and sediment transport index (STI). The second dataset was gathered by using the same conditioning factors of the first dataset, but with the addition of other conditioning factors: geological and environmental factors of soil, geology, land use/cover (LULC), distance from river, and distance from road. Two different datasets were constructed to compare the efficiency of one over the other in landslide susceptibility zonation. Three methods were implemented to recognize the importance of different conditioning factors in landslide susceptibility mapping. Three different types of models such as weights-of-evidence (WoE) (bivariate statistical analysis), logistic regression (LR) (multivariate statistical analysis), and data-driven support vector machine (SVM) were used to determine the optimal landslide conditioning factors. The area under curve (AUC) was used to assess the obtained results. The prediction rates of WoE, LR, and SVM obtained from only the LiDAR-derived conditioning factors were 59%, 86%, and 84%, respectively. The prediction rates of the WoE, LR, and SVM obtained ffom the second dataset were 65%, 66%, and 69%, respectively. The LiDAR-derived conditioning factors were more sufficient in generating an accurate landslide susceptibility map. Using additional factors, such as geology, LULC, and so on, does not significantly increase the accuracy of the map. The findings of this study can be used as reference for future analysis in selecting data for landslide conditioning factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The characterisation of soil surface roughness is a key requirement for the correct analysis of radar backscattering behaviour. It is noteworthy that an increase in the number of surface roughness parameters in a model also increases the difficulty with which data can be inverted for the purposes of estimating soil parameters. In this paper, a new description of soil surface roughness is proposed for microwave applications. This is based on an original roughness parameter, Zg, which combines the three most commonly used soil parameters: root mean surface height, correlation length, and correlation function shape, into just one parameter. Numerical modelling, based on the moment method and integral equations, is used to evaluate the relevance of this approach. It is applied over a broad dataset of numerically generated surfaces characterised by a large range of surface roughness parameters. A strong correlation is observed between this new parameter and the radar backscattering simulations, for the HH and VV polarisations in the C and X bands. It is proposed to validate this approach using data acquired in the C and X bands, at several agricultural sites in France. It was found that the parameter Zg has a high potential for the analysis of surface roughness using radar measurements. An empirical model is proposed for the simulation of backscattered radar signals over bare soil. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Forest monitoring has received increasing attention over the past decades from various international initiatives, among them the REDD+ program which crafts an incentive-based mechanism for reducing deforestation and forest degradation rates. The success of REDD+ depends also on effective monitoring systems that can produce credible and comparable forest cover estimates. If remote sensing technologies are to be involved, methods need to be developed to implement the politically negotiated forest definitions into the technical process of image analysis. We present here a new framework for translating elements of the currently discussed forest definitions into the analysis of satellite images. The framework is based on a hierarchical classification scheme which separates the process of image classification from the application of a specific forest definition. We test this approach for two contrasting tropical regions on RapidEye images which are classified using the Random Forests algorithm. The results show that the developed framework can be operationally applied on a project level and results in standardized forest cover maps with high accuracies. Furthermore, it can serve as a research tool for analyzing consequences of political decisions regarding the forest definitions as it readily enables the user to produce forest maps and estimate forest cover for different underlying forest definitions.

AB Surface reflectance is one of the key products from VIIRS and as with MODIS, is used in developing several higher-order land products. The VIIRS Surface Reflectance(SR) Intermediate Product (IP) is based on the heritage MODIS Collection 5 product (Vermote, El Saleous, & Justice, 2002). The quality and character of surface reflectance depend on the accuracy of the VIIRS Cloud Mask (VCM), the aerosol algorithms and the adequate calibration of the sensor. The focus of this paper is the early evaluation of the VIIRS SR product in the context of the maturity of the operational processing system, the Interface Data Processing System (IDPS). After a brief introduction, the paper presents the calibration performance and the role of the surface reflectance in calibration monitoring. The analysis of the performance of the cloud mask with a focus on vegetation monitoring (no snow conditions) showstypical problems over bright surfaces and high elevation sites. Also discussed is the performance of the aerosol input used in the atmospheric correction and in particular the artifacts generated by the use of the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System. Early quantitative results of the performance of the SR product over the AERONET sites show that with the few adjustments recommended, the accuracy is within the threshold specifications. The analysis of the adequacy of the SR product (Land PEATE adjusted version) in applications of societal benefits is then presented. We conclude with a set of recommendations to ensure consistency and continuity of the JPSS mission with the MODIS Land Climate Data Record. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Using remotely-sensed metrics to identify regions containing high animal diversity and/or specific animal species or guilds can help prioritize forest management and conservation objectives across actively managed landscapes. We predicted avian species richness in two mixed conifer forests, Moscow Mountain and Slate Creek, containing different management contexts and located in north-central Idaho. We utilized general linear models and an AIC model selection approach to examine the relative importance of a wide range of remotely-sensed ecological variables, including LiDAR-derived metrics of vertical and horizontal structural heterogeneities of both vegetation and terrain, and Landsat-derived vegetation reflectance indices. We also examined the relative importance of these remotely sensed variables in predicting nesting guild distributions of ground/understory nesters, midupper canopy nesters, and cavity nesters. All top models were statistically significant, with adjusted R(2)s ranging from 0.05 to 0.42. Regardless of study area, the density of the understory was positively associated with total species richness and the ground/understory nesting guild. However, the relative importance of ecological predictors generally differed between the study areas and among the nesting guilds. For example, for mid-upper canopy nester richness, the best predictors at Moscow Mountain included height variability and canopy density whereas at Slate Creek they included slope, elevation, patch diversity and height variability. Topographic variables were not found to influence species richness at Moscow Mountain but were strong predictors of avian species richness at the higher elevation Slate Creek, where species richness decreased with increasing slope and elevation. A variance in responses between focal areas suggests that we expand such studies to determine the relative importance of different factors in determining species richness. It is also important to note that managers using predictive maps should realize that models from one region may not adequately represent communities in other areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we developed a cluster-based method to estimate optimal thresholds and map urban extent from the DMSP/OLS Nil data in five major steps, including data preprocessing, urban cluster segmentation, logistic model development, threshold estimation, and urban extent delineation. In our method the optimal thresholds vary by clusters and are estimated based on cluster size and overall nightlight magnitude. The United States and China, two large countries with different urbanization patterns, were selected to test the proposed method. Our results indicate that the urbanized area occupies about 2% of total land area in the US, ranging from lower than 0.5% to higher than 10% at the state level, and less than 1% in China, ranging from lower than 0.1% to about 5% at the province level with some municipalities as high as 10%. The derived thresholds and urban extent were evaluated using a validation sub-sample of high-resolution land cover data at the cluster and regional levels. It was found that our method can map urban areas in both countries efficiently and accurately. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the derived optimal thresholds are not highly sensitive to the parameter choices in the logistic model. Our method reduces the over- and under-estimation issues often associated with previous fixed-threshold techniques when mapping urban extent over a large area. More importantly, our method shows potential to map global urban extent and temporal dynamics using the DMSP/OLS NTL data in a timely, cost-effective way. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Measurements of Total Suspended concentrations (ISS) are critical for monitoring geomorphological processes as well as ensuring the "good status" of transitional and coastal waters. Here, we explore the potential of the new DEIMOS-1, multi-spectral, medium-resolution satellite sensor for quantifying TSS dynamics within the large, turbid Guadalquivir estuary (SW Iberian Peninsula). Eight scenes were atmospherically corrected using various image-based procedures (apparent reflectance; Dark Object Subtraction, DOS; and solar zenith angle approximation, COSTZ). In-situ measurements (100 to 1400 mg L-1) from three campaigns coinciding ( 15 mm) with satellite overpasses were used to assess the semi-analytical algorithm from Nechad et al. (2010) relating water-leaving reflectance (rho(w)) to TSS. All bands were very sensitive to TSS, however saturation of the visible wavelengths was observed at the highest sediment loads. The best correlation was obtained for the NIR band (755-906 nm) using the simple band-reflectance model at the top of atmosphere reflectance (rho(w(ToA))), TSS (mg L-1) = 21428.77 rho(w(TOA)) (1 rho(w(TOA)) / 0.21) 346.17 (r(2) = 0.864, p < 0.001, epsilon(r) = 25.411%, n = 53), which was used to generate maps. This approach revealed detailed spatio-temporal variability in sediment concentrations within the river plume, near to shore and far up the river channel. We demonstrate that DEIMOS-1 has a high capability as a valuable tool for the frequent, synoptic monitoring of water-quality parameters needed for the optimum management of coastal and transitional waters.

AB A multi-sensor bias correction method has been developed using satellite sea surface temperature (SST) products from one microwave and five infrared sensors that cover the Arctic Ocean. The correction method has been used to construct improved single sensor and multi-sensor, merged and interpolated satellite SST products from January to December 2008.
   The validation of the satellite products ingested in the level 4 production shows that large biases can persist for months in this region. The SST products from the AATSR sensor on ENVISAT and the NAVOCEANO AVHRR GAC are the most stable and reliable products for the Arctic region. These products have therefore been used to construct the reference product against which the other satellite products have been corrected. The bias correction method has been developed using detailed error characteristics and thorough time-space analysis, and the bias corrected fields are validated against in situ observations from drifting buoys. All the individual satellite products show improvement in both bias and standard deviation after correction. Largest improvements are found for the Modis sensor on the Terra satellite, where biases are improved from -0.46 K to 0.02 K with the correction method. Temporal validation statistics reveal that extended periods with significant biases are also removed by the bias correction method. A significant improvement is seen when the corrected satellite products are used for the SST analysis. When compared against drifting buoys, not included in the analysis, the corrected level 4 satellite SST product shows a bias of -0.04 K and standard deviation of 0.54 K, compared to an original bias of -0.28 K and standard deviation of 0.61 K. The effect of a missing reference sensor is assessed for the full period. Level 4 test runs using only one reference sensor demonstrates that improvements can be obtained with a single sensor bias correction method, and that the AATSR sensor gives the largest improvements. However, using both reference sensors in the bias calculation gives significantly better performance than using just one. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using the airborne Polarimetric L-band Imaging Synthetic aperture radar (PUS) the impact of high revisit cycle and full polarimetric acquisitions on biomass retrieval was investigated by means of backscatter-based multi-temporal methods. Parametric and non-parametric models were used to relate reference biomass levels obtained from field plot measurements and high point density lidar data to backscatter intensities or polarimetric target decomposition components. Single-date retrieval using multiple independent variables provided lower estimation errors when compared to models using one independent variable with errors decreasing by 2% to 15%. The multi-temporal aggregation of daily biomass estimates did not improve the overall retrieval accuracy but provided more reliable estimates with respect to single-date methods. Backscatter intensities improved estimation accuracies up to 10% compared to polarimetric target decomposition components. Using all four polarizations increased the estimation accuracy marginally (2%). when compared to a dual-polarized system. The biomass estimation error was considerably reduced (up to 30%) only by decreasing the spatial resolution and was related to decreasing forest variability with increasing pixel size. These results indicate that, at least in semi-arid areas, future L-band missions would not significantly improve biomass estimation accuracy using backscatter-based modeling approaches despite their better spatial resolution, higher revisit cycles and the availability of fully polarimetric information.

AB A new algorithm for Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) of land cover using all available Landsat data is developed. It is capable of detecting many kinds of land cover change continuously as new images are collected and providing land cover maps for any given time. A two-step cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating "noisy" observations. A time series model that has components of seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The time series model is updated dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a total of 519) Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing the change detection accuracy, with 250 pixels selected within areas of persistent land cover and 250 pixels selected within areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting land surface change, with producer's accuracy of 98% and user's accuracies of 86% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 80%. Land cover reference data were used as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the land cover classification. The land cover map with 16 categories resulting from the CCDC algorithm had an overall accuracy of 90%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A quasi-analytical approach to deriving the coefficients of absorption, a(lambda), backscattering, b(b)(lambda), and the attenuation of planar irradiance, K-d(lambda), from sub-surface remote sensing reflectance, r(rs) (lambda), was investigated for the optically complex (Case 2) waters of the Irish Sea. The algorithms of Lee et al. (2005b, Journal of Geophysical Research Oceans, 110, C02017) were tuned for this region using radiative transfer calculations which incorporated locally determined specific inherent optical properties and constituent concentrations. The optimised algorithms were then applied to r(rs) spectra derived from profiling radiometry for 145 stations in the Irish Sea and adjacent waters, and their outputs compared with inherent optical property measurements for these stations. For the modelled data, recoveries of, a(lambda), b(b)(lambda) and K-d(lambda) in six wavebands between 412 nm and 667 nm had mean percentage errors below 3% and standard deviations of around 6%. For in situ data, the algorithms tended to over-estimate a(lambda) and under estimate b(b)(lambda) relative to measured values, but a contributing factor could be the difficulty of measuring optical properties accurately in turbid waters. Retrieved values of K-d(lambda) were highly correlated with those measured in situ, with regression slopes in the best-performing bands of 1.05 at 442 nm (r(2) = 0.91) and 0.92 at 488 nm (r(2) = 0.96). Three previously published relationships between satellite-derived optical properties at 490 nm and euphotic depth, z(1%PAR), produced roughly equivalent results with root mean square percentage errors, relative to in situ measurements, of around 20%. On the logarithmic scales usually employed in remote sensing, values of a(488), b(b)(488),K-d(488) and z(1%PAR) recovered using the optimised algorithms bore strong linear relationships to in situ measurements, with least square regression slopes in the range 0.89 to 1.03 and r(2) values from 0.87 to 0.94. Application of these algorithms to a MODIS image of the Irish Sea in early summer (25th May 2013) revealed marked spatial variations in optical properties which were well correlated with known patterns of tidal stirring in the region.

In low chlorophyll-a waters, the blue/green region of the spectrum is more sensitive to changes in chlorophyll-a concentration, whereas the red/NIR region becomes more important in turbid and/or eutrophic waters. In this work we present an approach to manage the shift from blue/green ratios to red/NIR-based chlorophyll-a algorithms for optically complex waters. Based on a combined in situ data set of coastal and inland waters, measures of overall algorithm uncertainty were roughly equal for two chlorophyll-a algorithms the standard NASA OC4 algorithm based on blue/green bands and a MERIS 3-band algorithm based on red/NIR bands-with RMS error of 0.416 and 0.437 for each in log chlorophyll-a units, respectively. However, it is clear that each algorithm performs better at different chlorophyll-a ranges. When a blending approach is used based on an optical water type classification, the overall RMS error was reduced to 0.320. Bias and relative error were also reduced when evaluating the blended chlorophyll-a product compared to either of the single algorithm products. As a demonstration for ocean color applications, the algorithm blending approach was applied to MERIS imagery over Lake Erie. We also examined the use of this approach in several coastal marine environments, and examined the long-term frequency of the OWTs to MODIS-Aqua imagery over Lake Erie. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Long-term observations of the surface radiation budget are essential for climate monitoring, climate model evaluation and solar energy applications. The Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) released a climate data record (CDR) of global and direct surface irradiance as well as effective cloud albedo derived from observations of the Meteosat First Generation satellites (MFG, 1983-2005). This study presents an extension of this CDR using measurements from the Meteosat Second Generation satellites (MSG, 2004-present). This extended surface radiation dataset spans nearly 30 years of data and, therefore, is in its uniquely high temporal and spatial resolution a valuable contribution to the climate community.
   In order to enable climatological consistency and homogeneity, the retrieval algorithm had to be modified for MSG: 1. The two narrowband visible channels of the MSG satellites are combined to simulate the MFG broadband visible channel; 2. The maximum cloud reflectance is empirically adjusted to account for the differences in the dynamic range of MSG compared to MFG.
   The extended dataset is tested for homogeneity and no significant breaks are detected during the overlap period of 2004-2005. Validation of the extended global radiation dataset against ground based observations from the Baseline Surface Radiation Network yields a mean monthly absolute bias of 8.15 W m(-2). This complies with the target accuracy threshold of 15 W m(-2) defined by the Global Climate Observing System.
   Global radiation has an overall positive, and significant, trend over the Meteosat disk which is mainly due to a negative trend in the effective cloud albedo, i.e., a decrease in cloudiness. Trends due to changes in the clear sky radiation are small and only induced by trends in the water vapor fields. Trends caused by changes in the direct effects of atmospheric aerosol are not represented because an aerosol climatology is used. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB A new dust detection algorithm is developed by combining the results of multiple dust detection methods using IR channels onboard the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Brightness Temperature Difference (BTD) between two wavelength channels has been used widely in previous dust detection methods. However, BTD methods have limitations in identifying the offset values of the BTD to discriminate clear-sky areas. The current algorithm overcomes the disadvantages of previous dust detection methods by considering the Brightness Temperature Ratio (BTR) values of the dual wavelength channels with 30-day composite, the optical properties of the dust particles, the variability of surface properties, and the cloud contamination. Therefore, the current algorithm shows improvements in detecting the dust loaded region over land during daytime. Finally, the confidence index of the current dust algorithm is shown in 10 x 10 pixels of the MODIS observations. From January to June, 2006, the results of the current algorithm are within 64 to 81% of those found using the fine mode fraction (FMF) and aerosol index (AI) from the MODIS and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The agreement between the results of the current algorithm and the OMI AI over the non-polluted land also ranges from 60 to 67% to avoid errors due to the anthropogenic aerosol. In addition, the developed algorithm shows statistically significant results at four AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites in East Asia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Realizing the full benefits of MODIS' temporal resolution requires, among others, the correction of the directional effect (i.e. the combined impact of the variation of the measurement geometry and of the observed land surface upon the registered radiant flux). While different BRDF methods have been proposed to address this effect, its performance has been evaluated at coarse spatial resolutions making it difficult to assess its applicability to, for example, crop monitoring. Here we test 2 approaches based on two different assumptions: the Classic approach that relies on the hypothesis of stable target and a recent Alternative that is based on the idea that despite reflectance magnitude may change rapidly, the BRDF shape varies slowly in time. Additionally, we segmented the growing season into different numbers of periods for the BRDF correction (a single period along the growing season, 3 periods based in phenology and 9-12 periods of fixed 16-days). The resulting 6 methods were compared over annual crops (wheat, maize and soybean) at 250 m spatial resolution from a site located in the Argentine Pampas. We used MOD and MYD 09 GQ and GA as inputs and compared the corrected daily red and infrared reflectances and the NDVI time series against the filtered benchmark (input time series with quality filters applied) by means of the high frequency variability (i.e. noise). We also tested whether corrected time series were better correlated with soybean PAR interception and biomass. Our results showed that methods' performance was more explained by the number of periods than by the approach (Classic or Alternative). Single period methods decreased noise by 52%, 55% and 4% for red, infrared and NDVI time series. The use of 3 periods improved the correction performance to 63, 64 and 24% for red, infrared and NVDI time series respectively, while the highest reductions (65,68 and 32% for red, infrared and NVDI) were found with 16-day intervals (9-12 periods) considering a magnitude inversion process. Wheat displayed the lowest noise reduction compared to the other crops. BRDF parameters obtained from different methods were associated to crop structure, suggesting that they have biophysical meaning. The decrease in noise obtained with correction methods was translated into a better assessment of the fraction of intercepted PAR and biomass. These promising results suggest the possibility of extensive field crop monitoring at an unprecedented temporal resolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The thermal infrared (TIR) wavelength region has proved highly useful for remotely extracting important parameters of volcanic activity, such as the composition, texture, and temperature of either the surface or gas/aerosol emissions. However, each of these characteristics can vary within the area of one pixel of a remote sensing dataset. which ultimately affects the accuracy of the retrieval of these characteristics. For example, where multiple temperatures occur in a particular pixel, the derived emissivity spectrum and pixel-integrated brightness temperature for that pixel are inaccurate. We present a new approach for deconvolving thermally-mixed pixels in a day/night pair of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared (TIR) scenes over Kilauea volcano, acquired during an active effusive phase in October 2006. The thermal deconvolution algorithm identifies thermally-mixed pixels and determines the multiple temperature components and their area, using data from the higher spatial resolution short wave infrared (SWIR) channels of ASTER. The effects of thermal mixing on the emissivity retrievals were quantified using a spectral deconvolution approach comparing the original to the thermally deconvolved data. The root mean squared (RMS) error improved slightly from.0.879 to 0.813, whereas the compositional end-members changed more dramatically (e.g., glass decreased from 70.2% to 49.3% and the vesicularity increased from 0.7% to 16.3%). The results provide more accurate temperature and emissivity data derived from ASTER data over thermally-elevated surfaces such as volcanoes and fires. This approach also serves as rapid means for accurately identifying sub-pixel temperatures, commonly obscured in low to medium spatial resolution orbital datasets. Moreover, it minimizes processing time, allowing critical information to be quickly disseminated. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The absorption spectra of phytoplankton in the visible domain hold implicit information on the phytoplankton community structure. Here we use this information to retrieve quantitative information on phytoplankton size structure by developing a novel method to compute the exponent of an assumed power-law for their particle-size spectrum. This quantity, in combination with total chlorophyll-a concentration, can be used to estimate the fractional concentration of chlorophyll in any arbitrarily-defined size class of phytoplankton. We further define and derive expressions for two distinct measures of cell size of mixed. populations, namely, the average spherical diameter of a bio-optically equivalent homogeneous population of cells of equal size, and the average equivalent spherical diameter of a population of cells that follow a power-law particle-size distribution. The method relies on measurements of two quantities of a phytoplankton sample: the concentration of chlorophyll-a, which is an operational index of phytoplankton biomass, and the total absorption coefficient of phytoplankton in the red peak of visible spectrum at 676 nm. A sensitivity analysis confirms that the relative errors in the estimates of the exponent of particle size spectra are reasonably low. The exponents of phytoplankton size spectra, estimated for a large set of in situ data from a variety of oceanic environments (similar to 2400 samples), are within a reasonable range; and the estimated fractions of chlorophyll in pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton are generally consistent with those obtained by an independent, indirect method based on diagnostic pigments determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The estimates of cell size for in situ samples dominated by different phytoplankton types (diatoms, prymnesiophytes, Prochlorococcus, other cyanobacteria and green algae) yield nominal sizes consistent with the taxonomic classification. To estimate the same quantities from satellite-derived ocean-colour data, we combine our method with algorithms for obtaining inherent optical properties from remote sensing. The spatial distribution of the size-spectrum exponent and the chlorophyll fractions of pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton estimated from satellite remote sensing are in agreement with the current understanding of the biogeography of phytoplankton functional types in the global oceans. This study contributes to our understanding of the distribution and time evolution of phytoplankton size structure in the global oceans. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The increasing availability of satellite images derived from multiple sensors creates opportunities for broader spatial and temporal coverage but also methodological challenges. We present a geostatistical inverse modeling (GIM) approach for merging coarse-resolution images with variable resolutions and for super-resolution (i.e., predictions at the sub-pixel level) mapping of continuous spatial processes. GIM can explicitly account for the differences in spatial supports of multiple datasets. The restricted maximum likelihood method was used for parameter estimations associated with the change-of-support problem. We used GIM to produce both spatial predictions of a target image and prediction uncertainties, while preserving the values of original measurements. GIM is totally data driven, and covariance parameters for a target resolution can be directly derived from measurements. We also developed a moving-window GIM approach to accommodate spatial nonstationarity and reduce computational burden associated with large image data. First we demonstrated GIM and moving-window GIM on synthetic images. Aggregated synthetic images with variable resolutions were merged to produce a single resolution image. The results show that the two approaches can produce accurate spatial predictions and generate prediction uncertainties. Second, we applied moving-window GIM for merging aerosol optical depth (ADD) data with variable resolutions, which were derived from two satellite sensors. The modeling results show that moving-window GIM can be applied for merging complementary AOD data from two sensors and for super-resolution mapping of global AOD distributions. Therefore, we can conclude that GIM is a practical solution for merging complementary coarse-resolution images and for super-resolution mapping of continuous spatial processes.

ID ANGULAR VARIATIONS; PROJECT; MODEL
AB Atmospheric turbulence in both surface (SBL) and planetary (PBL) boundary-layers govern rapid temporal fluctuations of the surface temperature (Ts), with potentially important resulting errors on instantaneous satellite measurements in the thermal infrared (TIR). An experiment designed to evaluate the error, and its reduction with spatial resolution (expected from ergodicity properties), of Ts is described. It is based on the analysis of time series of Ts at different resolutions reconstructed from sequences of images acquired at high frequency using a helicopter borne TIR camera over 5 different surfaces in the south-west of France, in the 2010 summer. Unfortunately the non-respect of a stationary flight resulted in a contamination of the data by directional effects; the filtering process developed to correct for this also eliminated the signature of low frequency PBL turbulence related to Is measurements, and made only possible the study of high frequency turbulence impact on Ts. For decreasing resolution (i.e., increase in pixel size), the contribution of the SBL turbulence to error rapidly decreases with resolution (i.e., pixel size increase); it reaches +/- 0.5 degrees C at 50 m, the resolution selected for recent spatial mission projects, with only little variations thereafter. Recommendations are made for future experiments to evaluate the overall error induced by atmospheric turbulence on satellite Ts measurements. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The boreal forest accounts for one-third of global forests, but remains largely inaccessible to ground-based measurements and monitoring. It contains large quantities of carbon in its vegetation and soils, and research suggests that it will be subject to increasingly severe climate-driven disturbance. We employ a suite of ground-, airborne- and space-based measurement techniques to derive the first satellite LiDAR-based estimates of aboveground carbon for the entire circumboreal forest biome. Incorporating these inventory techniques with uncertainty analysis, we estimate total aboveground carbon of 38 +/- 3.1 Pg. This boreal forest carbon is mostly concentrated from 50 to 55 degrees N in eastern Canada and from 55 to 60 degrees N in eastern Eurasia. Both of these regions are expected to warm >3 degrees C by 2100, and monitoring the effects of warming on these stocks is important to understanding its future carbon balance. Our maps establish a baseline for future quantification of circumboreal carbon and the described technique should provide a robust method for future monitoring of the spatial and temporal changes of the aboveground carbon content.

AB The inherent optical properties (IOPs) of natural waters are the most significant factors affecting light propagation within water columns, and thus play indispensable roles on estimation of aquatic biomass, primary production, and carbon pools. Despite its importance, no IOPs retrieval model was specifically developed for inland water bodies, although significant efforts were made on oceanic inversion models. In addition, for inland waters, an IOPs-based model is often preferred for estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, an application of IOPs, over empirical and some semi-empirical algorithms. Then developing a model for estimating both IOPs and Chl-a is of significance for understanding the bio-optical properties and occurrence of algal blooms in eutrophic reservoirs, lakes and estuaries. In this paper, an IOPs Inversion Model of Inland Waters (IIMIW) for deriving natural water IOPs and estimating Chl-a is proposed and validated. The results indicate that this model can be used to accurately retrieve absorption coefficients at 443 nm and 665 nm with R-2 = 0.8347 and R-2 = 0.7550 respectively for Indiana study sites, and to estimate Chl-a from the derived absorption coefficients at high accuracies (R-2 = 0.9292 and a mean relative error 21.65%) with samples collected from eight different study sites in the world and in different seasons. The model was also applied on Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Application (AISA) images to map IOPs and Chl-a. Through validation by in situ measured Chl-a, results directly show that IIMIW can predict Chl-a with good accuracy even using the AISA bands, to as well indirectly prove that non-water absorption coefficients are retrieved accurately, at least within red and near-infrared region. Further biogeochemical information can be derived from these maps as well. These promising mapping results reveal possible remote routine surveillance of bio-optical states of inland waters.

AB Retrievals of water quality parameters from satellite measurements over optically shallow waters have been problematic due to bottom contamination of the signals. As a result, large errors are associated with derived water column properties. These deficiencies greatly reduce the ability to use satellites to assess the shallow water environments around coral reefs and seagrass beds. Here, a modified version of an existing algorithm is used to derive multispectral diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d) from MODIS/Aqua measurements over optically shallow waters in the Florida Keys. Results were validated against concurrent in situ data (K-d(488) from 0.02 to 0.20 m(-1), N = 22, R-2 = 0.68, Mean Ratio = 0.93, unbiased RMS = 31%), and showed significant improvement over current products when compared to the same in situ data (N = 13, R-2 = 037, Mean Ratio = 1.61, unbiased RMS = 50%). The modified algorithm was then applied to time series of MODIS/Aqua data over the Florida Keys (in particular, the Florida Keys Reef Tract), whereby spatial and temporal patterns of water clarity between 2002 and 2011 were elucidated. Climatologies, time series, anomaly images, and empirical orthogonal function analysis showed primarily nearshore-offshore gradients in water clarity and its variability, with peaks in both at the major channels draining Florida Bay. ANOVA revealed significant differences in K-d(488) according to distance from shore and geographic region. Excluding the Dry Tortugas, which had the lowest climatological K-d(488), water was clearest at the northern extent of the Reef Tract, and K-d(488) significantly decreased sequentially for every region along the tract. Tests over other shallow-water tropical waters such as the Belize Barrier Reef also suggested general applicability of the algorithm. As water clarity and light availability on the ocean bottom are key environmental parameters in determining the health of shallow-water plants and animals, the validated new products provide unprecedented information for assessing and monitoring of coral reef and seagrass health, and could further assist ongoing regional zoning efforts.

AB This paper explores the spatiotemporal patterns of total phosphorus (TP) in Tampa Bay (Bay), Florida, with the aid of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and genetic programming (GP) models. The study was designed to link TP concentrations with relevant water quality parameters and remote sensing reflectance bands in aquatic environments using in-situ data from a local database to support the calibration and validation of the GP model. The GP models show the effective capacity to demonstrate snapshots of spatiotemporal distributions of TP across the Bay, which helps to delineate the short-term seasonality effects and the decadal trends of TP in an environmentally sensitive coastal bay area. In the past decade, urban development and agricultural activities in the Bay area have substantially increased the use of fertilizers. Landfall hurricanes, including Frances and Jeanne in 2004 and Wilma in 2005, followed by continuous droughts from 2006 to 2008 in South Florida, made the Bay area an ideal place for a remote sensing impact assessment. A changing hydrological cycle, triggered by climate variations, exhibited unique regional patterns of varying TP waste loads into the Bay over different time scales ranging from seasons to years. With the aid of the derived GP model in this study, we were able to explore these multiple spatiotemporal distributions of TP concentrations in the Tampa Bay area aquatic environment and to elucidate these coupled dynamic impacts induced by both natural hazards and anthropogenic perturbations. This advancement enables us to identify the hot moments and hot spots of TP concentrations in the Tampa Bay region. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This work presents a validation of the downwelling surface shortwave radiation, or surface solar radiation (SSR), derived from the Satellite Application Facility on Climate Monitoring (CM SAF) over Europe for a 23-year period of records on a monthly basis. This SSR product has been recently derived based on the visible channel of the Meteosat First Generation satellites, providing a dataset with a high spatial resolution (0.03 degrees x 0.03 degrees) covering the 1983-2005 period. The CM SAF SSR product is compared against a homogeneous dataset of surface observations from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) over Europe, which has been homogenized by means of the Standard Normal Homogeneity Test (SNHT). The results show a good agreement between both datasets (r(2) = 0.86, p < 0.01), with a slight overestimation (bias of +5.20 W m(-2)) of the CM SAF records as compared to the surface observations on a monthly mean basis. Equally, there is a monthly mean absolute bias difference (MABD) of 8.19 W m(-2) that is below the accuracy threshold defined by the CM SAF. There is a clear maximum and minimum MABD during summer and winter, respectively, with an opposite cycle if the relative MABD values are considered. Moreover, the temporal stability of the CM SAF SSR is checked against the GEBA stations for the mean time series over Europe, as well as for each individual series. The results point to possible inhomogeneities in the CM SAF records around 1987 and 1994, possibly due to changes in the satellite instruments, although other factors such as the lack of aerosol retrievals in the CM SAF SSR are also discussed. Consequently, the study of the means and trends in the SSR derived from CM SAF is only recommended for the records after 1994. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Eelgrass is a sentinel species that can indicate the overall health of a coastal ecosystem. An effective coastal management strategy should therefore map and actively monitor the distribution of this sentinel for any significant changes. While manual transect methods are commonly employed to map eelgrass, the analysis of remote imagery has been proposed as an efficient alternative; a remote sensor can capture large and inaccessible areas cost- and time-effectively, nearly instantly, and with high frequency. The purpose of this study was to explore and compare the efficacy of high spatial resolution airborne (AISA) and satellite (IKONOS) imagery for mapping eelgrass distribution at Sidney Spit, Gulf Islands National Park Reserve of Canada (GINPRC). The primary objective was to determine the optimal spectral resolution, spatial resolution and image processing effort for resolving bed location. A two-meter resolution hyperspectral AISA image and a four-meter resolution multispectral IKONOS image were acquired over Sidney Spit in August 2008. Concurrently collected were in situ above-water hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance, underwater videography, and water samples for optical constituent analysis. The images were subjected to varying combinations of 1) image processing steps: atmospheric correction, surface glint correction, deep water masking, and water column removal; 2) image classifiers: with differing user effort and data input requirements; and 3) spectral resolution: >200-band AISA versus a reduced resolution AISA image (AISA(r)) of only four key bands unique to eelgrass - slope 500-530 nm, first derivatives of 556 nm, 580 nm, and 602 nm (O'Neill et al. (2011)) - versus four-band IKONOS. The highest classification accuracies were achieved with atmospheric correction, glint correction, deep water masking, and maximum likelihood (ML) classification of the AISA(r) image and IKONOS full resolution image. AISA(r) achieved eelgrass producer and user accuracies of 85% in water less than 3 m deep, and 93% in deeper areas. IKONOS achieved 79% for water less than 3 m deep and 91% in deeper areas. Most confusion occurred between eelgrass and green algae, and between exposed eelgrass and other exposed vegetation. The most automated combination of methods yielded poor accuracies but could be greatly improved by refining atmospheric correction input parameters and building on the endmember spectral library. This study resulted in recommendations for remote eelgrass mapping and monitoring within the GINPRC. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Image matching via correlation of remotely sensed imagery is an increasingly popular technique for measuring glacier flow because it can provide spatially distributed measurements while mitigating many of the challenges accompanying in situ measurements of glacier velocity. Despite the increasing use of such techniques, and the requirement for well understood uncertainties where analysis of temporal variability is sought, studies that incorporate an assessment of accuracy based on in situ data remain rare. This study presents a rigorous methodology to quantify the uncertainties that apply to glacier flow velocities derived from optical satellite imagery. This method is applied on three successive ASTER images of Tasman Glacier, New Zealand. Evaluation of the quality of co-registration between image pair constituents allows unique uncertainties to be calculated for individual velocity measurements. These uncertainties have magnitudes that correspond to sub-pixel co-registration errors and account for anisotropic co-registration variance. Compared to estimated velocities, uncertainties on the order of 2-30% are achieved. Flow-fields for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 periods were derived using various spectral bands and validated with in situ data obtained by GPS survey over a nearly coincident period. This revealed the importance of considering the spectral characteristics of the target surface when selecting bands for image correlation, while validation demonstrated the success of the implemented methodology. Uncertainties derived for the flow-fields permitted statistical significance of velocity change between measurement periods to be assessed. Significant velocity changes, observed across the glacier surface, suggest that the Tasman Glacier behaves in a more dynamic way than previously recognised, highlighting the advantages of the methodology described here.

AB The importance of characterizing, quantifying, and monitoring land cover, land use, and their changes has been widely recognized by global and environmental change studies. Since the early 1990s, three U.S. National Land Cover Database (NLCD) products (circa 1992, 2001, and 2006) have been released as free downloads for users. The NLCD 2006 also provides land cover change products between 2001 and 2006. To continue providing updated national land cover and change datasets, a new initiative in developing NLCD 2011 is currently underway. We present a new Comprehensive Change Detection Method (CCDM) designed as a key component for the development of NLCD 2011 and the research results from two exemplar studies. The CCDM integrates spectral-based change detection algorithms including a Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) model and a novel change model called Zone, which extracts change information from two Landsat image pairs. The MIICA model is the core module of the change detection strategy and uses four spectral indices (CV, RCVMAX, dNER, and dNDVI) to obtain the changes that occurred between two image dates. The CCDM also includes a knowledge-based system, which uses critical information on historical and current land cover conditions and trends and the likelihood of land cover change, to combine the changes from MIICA and Zone. For NLCD 2011, the improved and enhanced change products obtained from the CCDM provide critical information on location, magnitude, and direction of potential change areas and serve as a basis for further characterizing land cover changes for the nation. An accuracy assessment from the two study areas show 100% agreement between CCDM mapped no-change class with reference dataset, and 18% and 82% disagreement for the change class for WRS path/row p22r39 and p33r33, respectively. The strength of the CCDM is that the method is simple, easy to operate, widely applicable, and capable of capturing a variety of natural and anthropogenic disturbances potentially associated with land cover changes on different landscapes.

AB With the advent of the free U.S. Landsat data policy it is now feasible to consider the generation of global coverage 30 m Landsat data sets with temporal reporting frequency similar to that provided by the monthly Web Enabled Landsat (WELD) products. A statistical Landsat metadata analysis is reported considering more than 800,000 Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM + acquisitions obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center archive. The global monthly probabilities of acquiring a cloud-free land surface observation for December 1998 to November 2001 (2000 epoch) and from December 2008 to November 2011 (2010 epoch) are reported to assess the availability of the Landsat data in the USGS Landsat archive for global multi-temporal land remote sensing applications. The global probabilities of acquiring a cloud-free land surface observation in each of three different seasons with the highest seasonal probabilities of cloud-free land surface observation are reported, considering one, two and three years of Landsat data, to assess the availability of Landsat data for global land cover mapping. The probabilities are derived considering Landsat 5 TM only, Landsat 7 ETM + only, and both sensors combined, to examine the relative benefits of using one or both Landsat sensors. The results demonstrate the utility of combing both Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM + data streams to take advantage of their different acquisition patterns and to mitigate the deleterious impact of the Landsat 7 ETM + 2003 scan line failure. Sensor combination provided a greater global acquisition coverage with a 1.7% to 14.4% higher percentage of land locations acquired monthly compared to considering Landsat 7 ETM + data alone. The mean global monthly probability of a cloud-free land surface observation for the combined sensors was up to nearly 1.4 and 6.7 times greater than for ETM + and TM alone respectively. The probability of acquiring a cloud-free Landsat land surface observation in different seasons was greater when more years of data were considered and when both Landsat sensor data were combined. Considering combined sensors and 36 months of data, 86.4% and 84.2% of the global land locations had probabilities >= 0.95 for the 2000 and 2010 epochs respectively, with a global mean probability of 0.92 (sigma 0.24) for the 2000 epoch and 0.90 (sigma 0.28) for the 2010 epoch. These results indicate that 36 months of combined Landsat sensor data will provide sufficient land surface observations for 30 m global land cover mapping using a multi-temporal supervised classification scheme.

AB Fuel moisture content (FMC) is an important variable for predicting the occurrence and spread of wildfire. Because FMC is calculated from the ratio of canopy water content to dry-matter content, we hypothesized that FMC may be estimated by remote sensing with a ratio of a vegetation water index to a vegetation dry-matter index. Four vegetation water indices, six dry-matter indices, and the resulting water/dry-matter index ratios were calculated using simulated leaf reflectances from the PROSPECT model. Two water indices, the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), were more correlated with leaf water content than with FMC, and were not correlated with leaf dry-matter content. Two dry-matter indices, the Normalized Dry Matter Index (NDMI) and a recent index (unnamed) were correlated to leaf dry matter content, were inversely correlated with FMC, and were not correlated with water content. Ratios of these water indices and these dry-matter indices were highly and consistently correlated with FMC. Ratios of other water indices with other dry-matter indices were not consistently correlated with FMC. The ratio of NDII with NDMI was strongly related to FMC by a quadratic polynomial equation with an R-2 of 0.947. Spectral reflectance data were acquired for single leaves and leaf stacks of Quercus alba, Acer rubrum, and Zea mays; the relationship between FMC and NDII/NDMI had an R-2 of 0.853 and was almost identical to the equation from the PROSPECT model simulations. For the SAIL model simulations, the relationship between NDII/NDMI and FMC at the canopy scale had an R-2 of 0.900, but the quadratic polynomial equation differed from the equations determined from the PROSPECT simulations and spectral reflectance data. NDMI requires narrow-band sensors to measure the effect of dry matter on reflectance at 1722 nm whereas NDII may be determined with many different sensors. Therefore, monitoring FMC with NDII/NDMI requires either a new sensor or a combination of two sensors, one with high temporal resolution for monitoring water content and one with high spectral resolution for estimating dry-matter content.

AB We extended the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) architecture to analytically derive absorption coefficient of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (a(g)). Specifically, we used an empirical formula based on total absorption and particle backscattering coefficients to estimate and then remove detritus absorption coefficient (a(d)), and developed a scheme to use absorption coefficients at three wavelengths (412,443, and 490 nm) for the separation of a(g) and a(ph) (absorption coefficient of phytoplankton). The algorithm was tested using an in situ data set collected in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait and a global in situ data set the NASA Bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD). Our results indicated that this new analytical algorithm for retrieving a(g) performed reasonably well with a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 45% for a(g)(412), while it also presented a satisfactory performance for a(ph) and a(d) in both coastal and oceanic waters. Furthermore, the applicability of this new algorithm for general oceanographic studies was briefly illustrated by applying it to MODIS measurements over the Taiwan Strait and the shelf region near the Mississippi River delta. Nevertheless, more independent tests with in situ and satellite data are needed to further validate and improve this innovative approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) have been shown to be useful for an indirect detection of plant diseases. However, these indices have not been evaluated to detect or to differentiate between plant diseases on crop plants. The aim of this study was to develop specific spectral disease indices (SDIs) for the detection of diseases in crops. Sugar beet plants and the three leaf diseases Cercospora leaf spot, sugar beet rust and powdery mildew were used as model system. Hyperspectral signatures of healthy and diseased sugar beet leaves were assessed with a non-imaging spectroradiometer at different developing stages and disease severities of pathogens. Significant and most relevant wavelengths and two band normalized differences from 450 to 950 nm, describing the impact of a disease on sugar beet leaves were extracted from the data-set using the RELIEF-F algorithm. To develop hyperspectral indices for the detection of sugar beet diseases the best weighted combination of a single wavelength and a normalized wavelength difference was exhaustively searched testing all possible combinations. The optimized disease indices were tested for their ability to detect and to classify healthy and diseased sugar beet leaves. With a high accuracy and sensitivity healthy sugar beet leaves and leaves, infected with Cercospora leaf spot, sugar beet rust and powdery mildew were classified (balanced classification accuracy: 89%, 92%, 87%, 85%, respectively). Spectral disease indices were also successfully applied on hyperspectral imaging data and on non-imaging data from a sugar beet field. Specific disease indices will improve disease detection, identification and monitoring in precision agriculture applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper a method to assimilate data from a visual/infrared (VIS/IR) sensor for the purpose of estimating sea ice concentration is investigated. A novel forward model is presented which allows the reflectances and brightness temperatures from the VIS/IR sensor to be assimilated. The VIS/IR data are assimilated in combination with ice concentration retrievals from a passive microwave sensor using 3D variational data assimilation into a 5 km x 5 km grid of sea ice concentrations. Results are compared with those from an experiment which assimilates only the ice concentration retrievals. It is found that the VIS/IR data have a positive impact as ice on the sea ice state through comparison with independent data. The proportion of points correctly identified asice or open water increased in each region studied by including the AVHRR data, with the largest increase being from 0.921 to 0.935. This positive impact is due to the higher resolution of the VIS/IR data as compared with the passive microwave data, that improves the representation of open water in bays and coastal polynyas. There is however, a degradation in the accuracy of the sea ice state in some regions of the analysis from assimilating the VIS/IR data. Possible ways of improving the impact from VIS/IR data are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper tests the application of airborne hyperspectral image data for estimating live vegetation fuel moisture content (FMC) in a Calluna vulgaris-dominated semi-natural upland area in the United Kingdom. Airborne hyperspectral imagery was collected over a north/south flight line covering the study site in May and July 2008. Ground data on live FMC were collected concurrently with the flights for ten study plots. Radiance values for the study plots were extracted from the airborne imagery and calibrated to reflectance using spectral measurements from reference targets measured on the ground at the time of the overflights. First derivatives, and a number of vegetation indices (VI), were calculated and correlated with field measured live FMC collected at the study plots. Vegetation FMC maps were produced for the study site for both dates. The results showed that live FMC exhibited spatial and temporal variations that affect the spectral reflectance measured by the airborne hyperspectral instrument, particularly in the near infrared and shortwave infrared regions. Using the first derivative and specific VI improved the correlation between the hyperspectral data and live FMC, but the simple two-wavelength Moisture Stress Index, based on measurements in the near infrared and shortwave infrared, was shown to be effective for FMC estimation. Live FMC was estimated with a root mean square error of 16.8% for all vegetation plots and 10.0% when considering plots composed only of C vulgaris. The results point to the prospect of FMC mapping for improved modelling of fire risk in UK uplands using remotely sensed data. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In glaciology, volumetric changes from multi-temporal digital elevation models (DEMs) serve to validate and calibrate glacier mass balances from traditional in situ measurements. In this study, we provide a thorough uncertainty assessment of multi-temporal airborne laser scanning DEMs based on: (a) applying a statistical error model, (b) comparing laser echoes to reference points and surfaces, and (c) developing a physical error propagation model. The latter model takes into account the measurement platform characteristics, components of the measurement process, and the surface properties. Such a model allows the estimation of systematic and stochastic uncertainties for single laser echoes, as well as for distributed surfaces in every part of the study site, independent of the reference surfaces. The full error propagation framework is applied to multi-temporal DEMs covering the highly undulating terrain in the Findelengletscher catchment in Canton Valais, Switzerland. This physical error propagation model is able to reproduce stochastic uncertainties in accordance with measurements from reference surfaces. The high laser point density in the study site reduces the stochastic uncertainties over the whole glacier area to negligibly small values. However, systematic uncertainties greatly influence the calculation of mass changes and lead to corrections of the thickness change of up to 35%. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Lakes are major repositories of biodiversity, provide multiple ecosystem services and are widely recognised as key indicators of environmental change. However, studies of lake response to drivers of change at a pan-European scale are exceptionally rare. The need for such studies has been given renewed impetus by concerns over environmental change and because of international policies, such as the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD), which impose legal obligations to monitor the condition of European lakes towards sustainable systems with good ecological status. This has highlighted the need for methods that can be widely applied across large spatial and temporal scales and produce comparable results. Remote sensing promises much in terms of information provision, but the spatial transferability and temporal repeatability of methods and relationships observed at individual or regional case studies remains unproven at the continental scale. This study demonstrates that NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) thermal data are capable of producing highly accurate (R-2>0.9) lake surface temperature (LST) estimates in lakes with variable hydromorphological characteristics and contrasting thermal regimes. Validation of the approach using archived AVHRR thermal data for Lake Geneva produced observations that were consistent with field data for equivalent time periods. This approach provides the basis for generalizing temporal and spatial trends in European lake surface temperature over several decades and confirms the potential of the full 30 year NOAA AVHRR archive to can provide AVHRR-derived LST estimates to help inform European policies on lake water quality.

AB The Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) was developed to address a need for macroscale measurements that reveal the structural, functional and organismic composition of Earth's ecosystems. In 2011, we completed and launched the CAO-2 next generation Airborne Taxonomic Mapping Systems (AToMS), which includes a high-fidelity visible-to-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer (380-2510 nm), dual-laser waveform light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanner, and high spatial resolution visible-to-near infrared (VNIR) imaging spectrometer (365-1052 nm). Here, we describe how multiple data streams from these sensors can be fused using hardware and software co-alignment and processing techniques. With these data streams, we quantitatively demonstrate that precision data fusion greatly increases the dimensionality of the ecological information derived from remote sensing. We compare the data dimensionality of two contrasting scenes - a built environment at Stanford University and a lowland tropical forest in Amazonia. Principal components analysis revealed 336 dimensions (degrees of freedom) in the Stanford case, and 218 dimensions in the Amazon. The Amazon case presents what could be the highest level of remotely sensed data dimensionality ever reported for a forested ecosystem. Simulated misalignment of data streams reduced the effective information content by up to 48%, highlighting the critical role of achieving high precision when undertaking multi-sensor fusion. The instrumentation and methods described here are a pathfinder for future airborne applications undertaken by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and other organizations.

AB Mountain pine beetle outbreaks have caused widespread tree mortality in North American forests in recent decades, yet few studies have documented impacts on carbon cycling. In particular, landscape scales intermediate between stands and regions have not been well studied. Remote sensing is an effective tool for quantifying impacts of insect outbreaks on forest ecosystems at landscape scales. In this study, we developed and evaluated methodologies for quantifying aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks affected by mountain pine beetle using field observations, lidar data, and multispectral imagery. We evaluated methods at two scales, the plot level and the tree level, to ascertain the capability of each for mapping AGC impacts of bark beetle infestation across a forested landscape. In 27 plots across our 5054-ha study area in central Idaho, we measured tree locations, health, diameter, height, and other relevant attributes. We used allometric equations to estimate AGC content of individual trees and, in turn, summed tree AGC estimates to the plot level. Tree-level and plot-level AGC were then predicted from lidar metrics using separate statistical models. At the tree level, cross-validated additive models explained 50-54% of the variation in tree AGC (root mean square error (RMSE) values of 26-42 kg AGC, or 32-48%). At the plot level, a cross-validated linear model explained 84% of the variation in plot AGC (RMSE of 9.2 Mg AGC/ha, or 12%). To map beetle-caused tree mortality, we classified high-resolution digital aerial photography into green, red, and gray tree classes with an overall accuracy of 87% (kappa = 0.79) compared with our field observations. We then combined the multispectral classification with lidar-derived AGC estimates to quantify the amount of AGC within beetle-killed trees at the field plots. Errors in classification, apparent tree lean caused by off-nadir aerial imagery, and a bias between percent cover and percent AGC reduced accuracy when combining multispectral and lidar products. Plot-level models estimated total plot AGC more accurately than tree-level models summed for plots as determined by RMSE (9.2 versus 21 Mg AGC/ha, respectively) and mean bias error (0.52 versus -6.7 Mg AGC/ha, respectively). When considering individual tree classes (green, red, gray) summed for plots, comparisons of plot-level and tree-level methods exhibited mixed results, with some accuracy measures higher for plot-level models. Despite a lack of clear improvement in tree-level models, we suggest that tree-level models should be considered for assessing situations with high spatial variability such as beetle outbreaks, especially if apparent tree lean effects can be minimized such as through the use of satellite imagery. Our methods illustrate the utility of combining lidar and multispectral imagery and can guide decisions about spatial resolution of analysis for understanding and documenting impacts of these forest disturbances.

AB The remote sensing measurement of land surface temperature from satellites provides a monitoring of this magnitude on a continuous and regular basis, which is a critical factor in many research fields such as weather forecasting, detection of forest fires or climate change studies, for instance. The main problem of measuring temperature from space is the need to correct for the effects of the atmosphere and the surface emissivity. In this work an automatic procedure based on the Vegetation Cover Method, combined with the GLOBCOVER land surface type classification, is proposed. The algorithm combines this land cover classification with remote sensing information on the vegetation cover fraction to obtain land surface emissivity maps for AATSR split-window bands. The emissivity estimates have been compared with ground measurements in two validation cases in the area of rice fields of Valencia. Spain, and they have also been compared to the classification-based emissivity product provided by MODIS (MOD11_12). The results show that the error in emissivity of the proposed methodology is of the order of +/- 0.01 for most of the land surface classes considered, which will contribute to improve the operational land surface temperature measurements provided by the AATSR instrument.

ID SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; OCEAN; RETRIEVAL
AB Hourly SST fields derived from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) are increasingly used in studies of the diurnal cycle of the oceans. Hourly diurnal warming (DW) estimates can be indeed derived as the difference between SEVIRI derived hourly daytime and predawn SST values. In this paper we compare these estimates with equivalent quantities derived from drifting buoy measurements over the SEVIRI disk. A good agreement between SEVIRI and drifter DW estimates has been found in over 1 year of using the operational SEVIRI matchup data base. A small underestimation of diurnal warming amplitude by SEVIRI has been identified for large DW events, mostly due to afternoon convection generating subpixel cloudiness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Steep terrain affects optical satellite images through variations it creates in both irradiance and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects. To obtain the corrected land surface reflectance and detect land surface change through time series analysis over rugged surfaces, it is necessary to remove or reduce the topographic effects. In this paper a physics-based BRDF and atmospheric correction model that handles both flat and inclined surfaces in conjunction with a 1-second SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission) derived Digital Surface Model (DSM) product was applied to 8 Landsat scenes covering different seasons and terrain types in eastern Australia. Visual assessment showed that the algorithm removed much of the topographic effect and detected deep shadows in all 8 images. An indirect validation based on the change in correlation between the data and terrain slope showed that the correlation coefficient between the surface reflectance factor and the cosine of the incident (sun) angle reduced dramatically after the topographic correction algorithm was applied. The correlation coefficient typically reduced from 0.80-0.70 to 0.05 in areas of significant relief. It was also shown how the terrain corrected surface reflectance can provide suitable input data for multi-temporal land cover classification in areas of high relief based on spectral signatures and spectral albedo, while the products based only on BRDF and atmospheric correction cannot. To provide comparison with previous work and to validate the proposed algorithm, two empirical methods based on the C-correction were used as well as the established SCS-method to provide benchmarks. The proposed method was found to achieve the same measures of shade reduction without empirical regression. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An informative and accurate vegetation map for the Greater Everglades of South Florida is in an urgent need to assist with the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), a $10.5-billion mission to restore the south Florida ecosystem in 30 + years. In this study, we examined the capability of fine spatial resolution hyperspectral imagery collected from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) for vegetation mapping in the Everglades. In order to obtain an efficient and accurate procedure for vegetation discrimination, we developed a neural network classifier first and then combined the object-based texture measures with the classifier to examine the contribution of the spatial information for vegetation mapping. The neural network is capable of modeling the characteristics of multiple spectral and spatial signatures within a class by an internally unsupervised engine and characterizing spectral and spatial differences between classes by an externally supervised system. The designed procedure was tested in a portion of the Everglades. An object-based vegetation map was generated with an overall classification accuracy averaged 94% and a kappa value averaged 0.94 in discriminating 15 classes. The results are significantly better than those obtained from conventional classifiers such as maximum likelihood and spectral angle mapper. The study illustrates that combining object-based texture measures in the neural network classifier can significantly improve the classification. It is concluded that fine spatial resolution hyperspectral data is an effective solution to accurate vegetation mapping in the Everglades which has a rich plant community with a high degree of spatial and spectral heterogeneity.

AB To meet the increasing need for reliable and timely timber resources and carbon stock estimates at intermediate and local decision levels, a sampling approach using airborne laser scanning (ALS) as a strip sampling tool has been proposed as a supplement to the conventional field-based National Forest Inventory system. This idea led to a large-scale biomass survey project undertaken in Hedmark County, Norway, an area encompassing 27390 km(2). The field biomass estimates were provided by the Norwegian NFI, and the ALS measurements were acquired in parallel strips using a systematic (SYS) design. The ALS-based biomass estimation was performed using regression estimators under design-based and the model-based inferential frameworks. A possible approach to assess the validity of inference when complex designs are involved is to use a sampling simulator where an artificial population represents the 'ground truth' and the properties of the estimators are investigated via simulated sampling. To create the artificial population, a large multivariate dataset containing NFI field observations and ALS metrics was generated using a copula function fitted to the empirical observations, and then it was generalized over the study area using satellite imagery and nearest: neighbor imputations. The properties of several design-based model-assisted and model-based variance estimators were investigated using simulated sampling and the accuracy of ALS-based and ground-based estimates under simple random sampling without replacement (SRSwoR) and SYS designs were compared. The simulation results indicated that the ALS-based survey produced valid inference under design-based and model-based frameworks. The variance estimators performed well under two-phase SRSwoR, but the real standard errors were overestimated approximately 4.7 times under two-phase SYS. Compared to the pure ground-based inventories, the estimated standard errors of the ALS-based estimates were approximately 1.8 times larger, while the real accuracy (in terms of root mean squared error) improved with 59%.

AB The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Department of Interior United States Geological Survey (USGS) are developing the successor mission to Landsat 7 that is currently known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM). NASA is responsible for building and launching the LDCM satellite observatory. USGS is building the ground system and will assume responsibility for satellite operations and for collecting, archiving, and distributing data following launch. The observatory will consist of a spacecraft in low-Earth orbit with a two-sensor payload. One sensor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI), will collect image data for nine shortwave spectral bands over a 185 km swath with a 30 m spatial resolution for all bands except a 15 m panchromatic band. The other instrument, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), will collect image data for two thermal bands with a 100 m resolution over a 185 km swath. Both sensors offer technical advancements over earlier Landsat instruments. OLI and TIRS will coincidently collect data and the observatory will transmit the data to the ground system where it will be archived, processed to Level 1 data products containing well calibrated and co-registered OLI and TIRS data, and made available for free distribution to the general public. The LDCM development is on schedule for a December 2012 launch. The USGS intends to rename the satellite "Landsat 8" following launch. By either name a successful mission will fulfill a mandate for Landsat data continuity. The mission will extend the almost 40-year Landsat data archive with images sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier missions to allow long-term studies of regional and global land cover change.

AB The recent advent of very high spectral resolution measurements by the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) on board the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) platform has made possible the retrieval of sun-induced terrestrial chlorophyll fluorescence (F-s) on a global scale. The basis for this retrieval is the modeling of the in-filling of solar Fraunhofer lines by fluorescence. This contribution to the field of space-based carbon cycle science presents an alternative method for the retrieval of Fs from the Fraunhofer lines resolved by GOSAT-FTS measurements. The method is based on a linear forward model derived by a singular vector decomposition technique, which enables a fast and robust inversion of top-of-atmosphere radiance spectra. Retrievals are performed in two spectral micro-windows (similar to 2-3 nm width) containing several strong Fraunhofer lines. The statistical nature of this approach allows to avoid potential retrieval errors associated with the modeling of the instrument line shape or with a given extraterrestrial solar irradiance data set. The method has been tested on 22 consecutive months of global GOSAT-FTS measurements. The fundamental basis of this F-s retrieval approach and the results from the analysis of the global F-s data set produced with it are described in this work. Among other findings, the data analysis has shown (i) a very good comparison of F-s intensity levels and spatial patterns with the state-of-the-art physically-based F-s retrieval approach described in Frankenberg et al. (2011a), (ii) the overall good agreement between F-s annual and seasonal patterns and other space-based vegetation parameters, (iii) the need for a biome-dependent scaling from F-s to gross primary production, and (iv) the apparent existence of strong directional effects in the F-s emission from forest canopies. These results reinforce the confidence in the feasibility of F-s retrievals with GOSAT-FTS and open several points for future research in this emerging field. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Tree canopy cover is a major biophysical attribute of dryland ecosystems. Monitoring its long-term changes over large spatial extents is critical for understanding woody vegetation response to climate variability and global change. However, quantifying tree canopy cover with remotely sensed data remains a challenge for dryland ecosystems where vegetation is sparse and trees, shrubs, and grasses often co-exist at fine spatial scales. In this study, we developed a full SMA (spectral mixture analysis) method that regressed photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and shade components of the SMA with dryland tree cover to monitor tree cover dynamics on a pinyon-juniper woodland landscape in Nevada, USA using Landsat TM data. We assessed 1) how well this method could estimate tree cover in both disturbed (chained and burned) and non-disturbed woodland patches and 2) how sensitive this method was to the confounding effects of climatic variations. The assessment was conducted in comparison with two other more commonly used methods that regressed NDVI or PV with tree cover. Our results showed that although PV performed better than NDVI, both methods overestimated tree canopy cover within recently disturbed woodland patches where the confounding effects of shrubs on greenness index were higher than in non-disturbed patches. The full SMA efficiently quantified variations within post-chaining patches in addition to non-disturbed patches, but overestimated tree cover within burned patches. Of the three methods tested, only full SMA showed promising capability for mitigating the confounding effects of interannual climatic variations on monitoring the woodland recovery process. Our results are generalizable to other semi-arid landscapes comprising a mosaic of small-statured trees intermixed with shrub steppe vegetation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Avian biodiversity is threatened, and in order to prioritize limited conservation resources and conduct effective conservation planning a better understanding of avian species richness patterns is needed. The use of image texture measures, as a proxy for the spatial structure of land cover and vegetation, has proven useful in explaining patterns of avian abundance and species richness. However, prior studies that modeled habitat with texture measures were conducted over small geographical extents and typically focused on a single habitat type. Our goal was to evaluate the performance of texture measures over broad spatial extents and across multiple habitat types with varying levels of vertical habitat structure. We calculated a suite of texture measures from 114 Landsat images over a study area of 1,498,000 km(2) in the Midwestern United States, which included habitats ranging from grassland to forest. Avian species richness was modeled for several functional guilds as a function of image texture. We subsequently compared the explanatory power of texture-only models with models fitted using landscape composition metrics derived from the National Land Cover Dataset, as well as models fitted using both texture and composition metrics. Measures of image texture were effective in modeling spatial patterns of avian species richness in multiple habitat types, explaining up to 51% of the variability in species richness of permanent resident birds. In comparison, landscape composition metrics explained up to 56% of the variability in permanent resident species richness. In the most heavily forested ecoregion, texture-measures outperformed landscape metrics, and the two types of measurements were complementary in multivariate models. However, in two out of three ecoregions examined, landscape composition metrics consistently performed slightly better than texture measures, and the variance explained by the two types of measures overlapped considerably. These results show that image texture measures derived from satellite imagery can be an important tool for modeling patterns of avian species richness at broad spatial extents, and thus assist in conservation planning. However, texture measures were slightly inferior to landscape composition metrics in about three-fourths of our models. Therefore texture measures are best considered in conjunction with landscape metrics (if available) and are best used when they show explanatory ability that is complementarity to landscape metrics.

AB Light use efficiency (LUE) is an important variable characterizing plant eco-physiological functions and refers to the efficiency at which absorbed solar radiation is converted into photosynthates. The estimation of LUE at regional to global scales would be a significant advantage for global carbon cycle research. Traditional methods for canopy level LUE determination require meteorological inputs which cannot be easily obtained by remote sensing. Here we propose a new algorithm that incorporates the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and a modified form of land surface temperature (T-m) for the estimation of monthly forest LUE based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. Results demonstrate that a model based on EVI x T-m parameterized from ten forest sites can provide reasonable estimates of monthly LUE for temperate and boreal forest ecosystems in North America with an R-2 of 0.51 (p<0.001) for the overall dataset. The regression coefficients (a, b) of the LUE-EVI x T-m correlation for these ten sites have been found to be closely correlated with the average EVI (EVI_ave, R-2=0.68, p=0.003) and the minimum land surface temperature (LST_min, R-2=0.81, p=0.009), providing a possible approach for model calibration. The calibrated model shows comparably good estimates of LUE for another ten independent forest ecosystems with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.055 g C per mol photosynthetically active radiation. These results are especially important for the evergreen species due to their limited variability in canopy greenness. The usefulness of this new LUE algorithm is further validated for the estimation of gross primary production (GPP) at these sites with an RMSE of 37.6 g Cm-2 month(-1) for all observations, which reflects a 28% improvement over the standard MODIS GPP products. These analyses should be helpful in the further development of ecosystem remote sensing methods and improving our understanding of the responses of various ecosystems to climate change.

AB The aerosol component of the Oxford-Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) Aerosol and Clouds (ORAC) retrieval scheme for the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) uses data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD'S) to constrain the brightness of the surface. However, the spectral response functions of the channels used (centred near 550 nm, 660 nm, 870 nm, and 1.6 mu m) do not exactly match between the two sensors. It is shown that failure to account for differences between the instruments' spectral response functions leads to errors of typically 0.001-0.01 in spectral surface albedo, and distinct biases, dependent on wavelength and surface type. A technique based on singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce these random errors by an average of 35% at 670 nm and over 60% at the other wavelengths used. The technique reduces the biases so that they are negligible. In principle, the method can be extended to any combination of sensors. The SVD-based scheme is applied to AATSR data from the month of July 2008 and found to increase the number of successful aerosol retrievals, the speed of retrieval convergence, and improve the level of consistency between the measurements and the retrieved state. Additionally, retrieved aerosol optical depth at 550 nm shows an improvement in correspondence when compared to Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Radiometric measurements of the sea surface temperature (SST) made by the infrared SST autonomous radiometer (ISAR) deployed routinely between 2004 and 2009 from a passenger vessel traversing the English Channel and Bay of Biscay are used to validate satellite SST data products produced using the Advanced along-track scanning radiometer (AATSR) flown on Envisat. More than 1500 independent pairings between an ISAR record and an AATSR pixel, coincident within specified space-time matching windows, are analysed. These confirm good agreement between the in situ and the satellite derived SST estimates, based on the dual view AATSR algorithms, with a bias of less than 0.1 K which is the accuracy limit of the ISAR. The standard deviation of the comparisons depends on the coincidence criteria: for a match-up window of 1 km and 2 h it is around 0.3 K for the three channel (night only) algorithm and 0.4 K for the 2 channel algorithm. Separate validation statistics are produced for the periods before and after 7 Dec 2005 when a change was made to the AATSR algorithms. It is shown that the error distribution was narrowed by introducing the new algorithm and further narrowed by using only the AATSR data that have the highest Confidence Value. This is the first systematic use of autonomous underway shipboard radiometry on a vessel of opportunity for validating satellite data. The methodology is carefully assessed and shown to provide an effective and reliable means of confirming the high quality and stability of the SST data products from AATSR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study is concerned with the implications of changing latitudinal gradients in vegetative phenology (green-up, senescence, and length of growing season) for the management of long-distance seasonal movements of livestock herds in Sudano-Sahelian West Africa. For a study area covering much of the southern half of Mali, phenological parameters were estimated using a double-logistic function fitted to seasonal NDVI trajectories for 1 km(2) MODIS data over the period 2000-2010. Green-up dates, senescence dates and length of growing season were all found to more strongly vary by latitude (+9 days/degree, 5 days/degree and -14 days/degree, respectively) than across years (+0.42 days/year, +0.86 days/year and +0.44 days/year respectively). Interannual and spatial variability of these parameters are highest at lower latitudes within the study area. The slopes of the relationship of phenological parameters with latitude change across the latitudinal range studied. Breakpoint analysis of annual green-up versus latitude curves identifies a mean inflection point of 13 degrees north latitude above which the positive slope declines significantly. This previously-undescribed pattern is consistent with recent work on monsoonal dynamics showing rainfall onset being associated with an abrupt shift in the location of the ITCZ (monsoon onset) at latitudes north of 13 degrees north latitude. The effects of the observed variation in latitudinal gradients of phenological variables on the direction and timing of regional livestock movements are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Treefall gaps play important roles in both forest dynamics and species diversity, but variability across the full range of gap sizes has not been reported at a regional scale due to the lack of a consistent methodology for their detection. Here we demonstrate the sensitivity of Landsat data for detecting gaps at the subpixel level in the Manaus region, Central Amazon. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) on treefall gaps was used to map their occurrence across a 3.4 x 10(4) km(2) landscape using the annual change in non-photosynthetic vegetation (Delta NPV) as the change metric. Thirty randomly selected pixels with a spectral signature of a treefall event (i.e. high Delta NPV) were surveyed in the field. The most frequent single-pixel gap size detected using Landsat was similar to 360 m(2), and the severity of the disturbance (Delta NPV) exhibited a significant (r(2) = 0.32, p = 0.001) correlation with the number of dead trees (>10 cm diameter at breast height), enabling quantification of the number of downed trees in each gap. To place the importance of these single-pixel disturbances into a broader context, the cumulative disturbance of these gaps was equivalent to 40% of the calculated deforestation across the Manaus region in 2008. Most detected single-pixel gaps consisted of six to eight downed trees covering an estimated area of 250-900 m(2). These results highlight the quantitative importance of small blowdowns that have been overlooked in previous satellite remote sensing studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Sundarbans is the world's largest remaining single block of mangrove forest, covering approximately 1 million ha (similar to 1,000 km(2)) of the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta along the coastal areas of India and Bangladesh. Sea level rise and alteration of water flows of the Himalayan headwaters are among the major disturbances threatening these coastal areas. But very few studies exist on the dynamics or current status of the Sundarbans coastline. We used Landsat images spanning from 1973 to 2010, and an algorithm that we developed, to consistently estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of erosion and accretion for four different time intervals and the whole study period. Our results show that the direction and extent of erosion and accretion rates varied throughout the different periods. Erosion was the highest in the 1973-1979 interval, with 23.2 km(2) year(-1) of land loss. However, that rate substantially declined in the following periods, reaching a rate of 7-10 km(2) year(-1). Accretion showed a rate of 10 km(2) year(-1) between 1973 and 1989, but substantially declined to similar to 4 km(2) year(-1) between 1989 and 2010. Accretion rate has declined in the recent years but erosion rate has remained relatively high. As a result the delta front has undergone a net erosion of similar to 170 km(2) of coastal land in the 37 years of our study period. These numbers are significantly higher than the previously reported rates and magnitudes of erosion in this area. The methods and maps developed in this study may be helpful in management planning of this vulnerable coastline. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The term urban heat island describes the phenomenon of altered temperatures in urban areas compared to their rural hinterlands. A surface urban heat island encompasses the patterns of land surface temperatures in urban areas. The classical indicator to describe a surface urban heat island is the difference between urban and rural surface temperatures. However, several other indicators for this purpose have been suggested in the literature. In this study, we compared the eleven different indicators for quantifying surface urban heat islands that were most frequently used in recent publications on remote sensing-based urban heat island assessments. The dataset used here consists of 263 European cities with monthly mean temperatures from MODIS data products for July 2002, January 2003 and July 2003. We found that (i) the indicators individually reveal diurnal and seasonal patterns but show rather low correlations over time, and (ii) for single points in time, the different indicators show only weak correlations, although they are supposed to quantify the same phenomenon. Differentiating cities according to thermal climate zones increased the relationships between the indicators. Thus, we can identify temporal aspects and indicator selection as important factors determining the estimation of urban heat islands. We conclude that research should take into account the differences and instabilities of the indicators chosen for quantifying surface urban heat islands and should use several indicators in parallel for describing the surface urban heat island of a city.

AB At present, the greatest source of uncertainty in the global carbon cycle is in the terrestrial ecosystems. In order to reduce these uncertainties it is necessary to provide consistent and accurate global estimates of the world forest biomass. One of the most promising methods for obtaining such estimates is through polarimetric SAR backscatter measurements at low frequencies. In this paper, the relation between polarimetric SAR backscatter at L- and P-bands and forest biomass is investigated using data acquired within the BioSAR-I campaign in southern Sweden during 2007. Methods for estimating biomass on stand level using these data are developed and evaluated, and the results for the two frequency bands are compared. For L-band data, the best results were obtained using HV-polarized backscatter only, giving estimation errors in terms of root mean square errors (RMSE) between 31% and 46% of the mean biomass for stands with biomass ranging from 10 to 290 t/ha, and an (adjusted) coefficient of determination (R-2) between 0.4 and 0.6. For P-band data, the results are better than for L-band. Models using HV- or HH-polarized P-band backscatter give similar results, as does a model including both HV and HH. The RMSEs were between 18 and 27%, and the R-2 values were between 0.7 and 0.8. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID PERMANENT SCATTERERS
AB In this paper, two Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) methodologies are compared in order to further understand their potential in the detection of surface deformation. A comparison of these two algorithms is a comparison of the two classes of PSI techniques available: coherence estimation based on a temporal model of deformation (represented by DePSI) and coherence estimation based on spatial correlation (represented by StaMPS). Despite the similarity between the results obtained from the application of the two independent PSI methodologies, significant differences in PS density and distribution were detected, motivating a comparative study between both techniques. We analyze which approach might be more appropriate for studying specific areas/environments, which is helpful in evaluating the benefits that could be derived from an integration of the two methodologies. Several experiments are performed to assess the sensitivity of both PSI approaches to different parameter settings and circumstances. The most significant differences in the processing chain of both procedures are then investigated. We apply both methodologies to the Granada Basin area (southern Spain) and realize that coherence does not improve significantly as function of the methodology applied. If oversampling is implemented in the StaMPS processing chain, the PS density increases so that the density in the urbanized areas is similar to the results provided by DePSI but in all the remaining covers the density is significantly higher. The general results provided by both approaches are very similar in the relative deformations estimated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Optical measurements including remote sensing provide a potential tool for the identification of dominant phytoplankton groups and for monitoring spatial and temporal changes in biodiversity in the upper ocean. We examine the application of an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis to phytoplankton pigment data and spectra of the absorption coefficient and remote-sensing reflectance with the aim of discriminating different phytoplankton assemblages in open ocean environments under non-bloom conditions. This technique is applied to an optical and phytoplankton pigment data set collected at several stations within the eastern Atlantic Ocean, where the surface total chlorophyll-a concentration (TChla) ranged from 0.11 to 0.62 mg m(-3). Stations were selected on the basis of significant differences in the ratios of the two most dominant accessory pigments relative to TChla, as derived from High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The performance of cluster analysis applied to absorption and remote-sensing spectra is evaluated by comparisons with the cluster partitioning of the corresponding HPLC pigment data, in which the pigment-based clusters serve as a reference for identifying different phytoplankton assemblages. Two indices, cophenetic and Rand, are utilized in these comparisons to quantify the degree of similarity between pigmentbased and optical-based clusters. The use of spectral derivative analysis for the optical data was also evaluated, and sensitivity tests were conducted to determine the influence of parameters used in these calculations (spectral range, smoothing filter size, and band separation). The results of our analyses indicate that the second derivative calculated from hyperspectral (1 nm resolution) data of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient, a(ph)(lambda), and remote-sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda), provide better discrimination of phytoplanIcton pigment assemblages than traditional multispectral band-ratios or ordinary (non-differentiated) hyperspectral data of absorption and remote-sensing reflectance. The most useful spectral region for this discrimination extends generally from wavelengths of about 425-435 nm to wavelengths within the 495-540 nm range, although in the case of phytoplankton absorption data a broader spectral region can also provide satisfactory results.

AB AMSR-E has been extensively evaluated under a wide range of ground and climate conditions using in situ and aircraft data, where the latter were primarily used for assessing the T-B calibration accuracy. However, none of the previous work evaluates AMSR-E performance under the conditions of flood irrigation or other forms of standing water. Also, it should be mentioned that global soil moisture retrievals from AMSR-E typically utilize X-band data. Here, C-band based AMSR-E soil moisture estimates are evaluated using 1 km resolution retrievals derived from L-band aircraft data collected during the National Airborne Field Experiment (NAFE'06) field campaign in November 2006. NAFE'06 was conducted in the Murrumbidgee catchment area in southeastern Australia, which offers diverse ground conditions, including extensive areas with dryland, irrigation, and rice fields. The data allowed us to examine the impact of irrigation and standing water on the accuracy of satellite-derived soil moisture estimates from AMSR-E using passive microwave remote sensing. It was expected that in fields with standing water, the satellite estimates would have a lower accuracy as compared to soil moisture values over the rest of the domain. Results showed sensitivity of the AMSR-E to changes in soil moisture caused by both precipitation and irrigation, as well as good spatial (average R = 0.92 and RMSD = 0.049 m(3)/m(3)) and temporal (R = 0.94 and RMSD = 0.04 m(3)/m(3)) agreement between the satellite and aircraft soil moisture retrievals; however, under the NAFE'06 ground conditions, the satellite retrievals consistently overestimated the soil moisture conditions compared to the aircraft.

AB A full-chain process approach to extracting reflectance information from hyperspectral (HRS) data which is valid for all sensor qualities is proposed. This method is based on a mission-by-mission approach, followed by a unique vicarious calibration stage. As the HRS sensor's performance may vary in time and space, a vicarious calibration method to retrieve accurate at-sensor radiance values is necessary. In fact, vicarious calibration solutions usually rely on natural, well-known, bright and dark targets that are large in size and radiometrically homogeneous. Since such targets are not commonly found in the field for every mission and their spectral features can sometimes resemble artifacts in the corrected radiance, a new vicarious calibration approach is needed. This paper describes a new method that uses artificial agricultural black polyethylene nets of various densities as vicarious calibration targets that are set up along the airplane's trajectory (preferably near the airfield). The different densities of the nets combined with any bright background afford full coverage of the sensor's dynamic range. We show that these artificial targets can be used to assess data quality and correct at-sensor radiance within a short time. Several case studies are presented using Aisa-DUAL sensor data taken at different times from different locations. We found that even "lost data" (in terms of radiance drift) could be recovered by the suggested method. We term the suggested vicarious calibration approach supervised vicarious calibration (SVC) and demonstrate its performance in terms of spectral accuracy. The limitations of the method are also discussed but the overall conclusion is that the suggested procedure is functional, valuable and practical for sensors with questionable or uncertain laboratory-determined radiometric parameters.

AB Vegetation water content retrieval using passive remote sensing techniques in the 0.4-2.5 mu m region (reflection of solar radiation) and the 8-14 mu m region (emission of thermal radiation) has given rise to an abundant literature. The wavelength range in between, where the main water absorption bands are located, has surprisingly received very little attention because of the complexity of the radiometric signal that mixes both reflected and emitted fluxes. Nevertheless, it is now covered by the latest generation of passive optical sensors (e.g. SEBASS, AHS). This work aims at modeling leaf spectral reflectance and transmittance in the infrared, particularly between 3 mu m and 5 mu m, to improve the retrieval of vegetation water content using hyperspectral data. Two unique datasets containing 32 leaf samples each were acquired in 2008 at the USGS National Center, Reston (VA, USA) and the ONERA Research Center, Toulouse (France). Reflectance and transmittance were recorded using laboratory spectrometers in the spectral region from 0.4 mu m to 14 mu m, and the leaf water and dry matter contents were determined. It turns out that these spectra are strongly linked to water content up to 5.7 mu m. This dependence is much weaker further into the infrared, where spectral features seem to be mainly associated with the biochemical composition of the leaf surface. The measurements show that leaves transmit light in this wavelength domain and that the transmittance of dry samples can reach 0.35 of incoming light around 5 mu m, and 0.05 around 11 mu m. This work extends the PROSPECT leaf optical properties model by taking into account the high absorption levels of leaf constituents (by the insertion of the complex Fresnel coefficients) and surface phenomena (by the addition of a top layer). The new model, PROSPECT-VISIR (VISible to InfraRed), simulates leaf reflectance and transmittance between 0.4 mu m and 5.7 mu m (at 1 nm spectral resolution) with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.017 and 0.018, respectively. Model inversion also allows the prediction of water (RMSE = 0.0011 g/cm(2)) and dry matter (RMSE=0.0013 g/cm(2)) contents. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we investigate the surface-atmosphere radiative interaction in application to the problem of aerosol satellite remote sensing over land. First, we test different models of the Bidirectional Reflectance and Polarization Distribution Function (BRDF and BPDF) for bare soil and vegetation surfaces using multi-angle, multi-spectral photopolarimetric airborne measurements of the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). Then, we investigate the performance of different models of BRDF and BPDF for modeling top-of-atmosphere measurements. We have found that different BRDF models can describe the RSP measurements equally well. However, for soil surfaces, the different BRDF models show a different dependence on illumination geometry (solar zenith and azimuth angles), as well as a different dependence on viewing angle outside the range of RSP measurements. This implies that different models describe the surface-atmosphere interaction differently, leading for soil surfaces to differences in the top-of-atmosphere reflectance up to 4-5%, whereas at surface level the models agree within 2% for RSP illumination and measurement geometry. For vegetation, the different BRDF models show more similar dependence on illumination geometry, meaning that, in general, the differences in top-of-atmosphere reflectances are smaller than the differences in surface total reflectances. For the BPDF. we compare the empirical model of Nadal and Breon (1999) and the model developed by Maignan et al. (2009) with a newly developed model. The latter model compares better with RSP measurements. It was shown that, though all models have essentially different angular profiles at different illumination and viewing geometries, the difference of the top-of-atmosphere degree of linear polarization is less or is of the same order as the degree of linear polarization difference at the surface level taken at RSP illumination and measurement geometry. For the considered models, it can be up to 0.015 but is mostly below 0.005. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The magnitude, duration, and frequency of forest disturbance caused by the spruce budworm and forest tent caterpillar in northern Minnesota and neighboring Ontario, Canada have increased over the last century due to a shift in forest species composition linked to historical fire suppression, forest management, and pesticide application that has fostered increased dominance of host tree species. Modeling approaches are currently being used to understand and forecast potential management effects in changing insect disturbance trends. However, detailed forest composition data needed for these efforts is often lacking. We used partial least squares (PLS) regression to integrate different combinations of satellite sensor data including landsat, Radarsat-1, and PALSAR, as well as pixel-wise forest structure information derived from SPOT-5 sensor data (Wolter et al., 2009), to determine the best combination of sensor data for estimating near species-level proportional forest composition (12 types: 10 species and 2 genera). Single-sensor and various multi-sensor PLS models showed distinct species-dependent sensitivities to relative basal area (BA), with Landsat variables showing greatest overall sensitivity. However, best results were achieved using a combination of data from all these sensors, with several C-band (Radarsat-1) and L-band (PALSAR) variables showing sensitivity to the composition and abundance of specific species. Pixel-level forest structure estimates derived from SPOT-5 data were generally more sensitive to conifer species abundance (especially white pine) than to hardwood species composition. Relative BA models accounted for 68% (jack pine) to 98% (maple spp.) of the variation in ground data with RMSE values between 2.46% and 5.65% relative BA, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the effective lower limits of usefulness of species relative BA estimates which ranged from 5.94% (jack pine) to 39.41% (black ash). These estimates were then used to produce a dominant forest species map for the study region with an overall accuracy of 78%. Most notably, this approach facilitated discrimination of aspen from paper birch as well as spruce and fir from other conifer species which is crucial for the study of forest tent caterpillar and spruce budworm dynamics in the Upper Midwest. We also demonstrate that PLS regression is an effective data fusion strategy for mapping composition of heterogeneous forests using satellite sensor data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The North American Forest Dynamics (NAFD) study is a core project of the North American Carbon Program (NACP). The NAFD project is evaluating forest disturbance patterns and rates of disturbance by integrating U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field observations with temporally dense time series Landsat imagery. In Phase I of NAFD forest disturbance history was derived for 23 U.S. sample locations over the time period 1984 to 2005 from biennial Landsat time series stacks (LTSS). This study evaluates the accuracy of these Phase I NAFD disturbance history maps for 6 selected sample locations. We evaluate the disturbance maps using 2 reference datasets: 1) a design-based approach incorporating visual analysis of the LTSS in tandem with high resolution imagery and 2) the USDA FIA field observations. Overall accuracy for the NAFD disturbance product assessed at the individual time step level range from 77% to 86%. We examine the success rates of the mapping approach for capturing different types of disturbance and find that 82% of stand clearing events were detected. When we aggregate the data into change and no change categories the accuracy of stand clearing disturbance samples improved to over 92%. The majority of error in the disturbance maps was due to misclassification of partial disturbance as unchanged forest. We analyze the resulting errors of commission and omission as related to both reference datasets for each ass and present examples to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of Phase I NAFD approach. In addition, we discuss the map biases observed in this work and what this may imply for estimating national forest disturbance rates with this approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE Snow water equivalent; Passive microwave; Tundra; Sub-Arctic
ID DEPTH; ALASKA; COVER
AB Airborne and satellite brightness temperature (T-B) measurements were combined with intensive field observations of sub-Arctic tundra snow cover to develop the framework for a new tundra-specific passive microwave snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval algorithm. The dense snowpack and high sub-grid lake fraction across the tundra mean that conventional brightness temperature difference approaches (such as the commonly used 37 GHz-19 GHz) are not appropriate across the sub-Arctic. Airborne radiometer measurements (with footprint dimensions of approximately 70x120 m) acquired across sub-Arctic Canada during three field campaigns during the 2008 winter season were utilized to illustrate a slope reversal in the 37 GHz T-B versus SWE relationship. Scattering by the tundra snowpack drives a negative relationship until a threshold SWE value is reached near 130 mm at which point emission from the snowpack creates a positive but noisier relationship between 37 GHz T-B and SWE.
   The change from snowpack scattering to emission was also evident in the temporal evolution of 37 GHz T-B observed from satellite measurements. AMSR-E brightness temperatures (2002/03-2006/07) consistently exhibited decreases through the winter before reaching a minimum in February or March, followed by an increase for weeks or months before melt. The cumulative absolute change (Sigma vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar) in vertically polarized 37 GHz T-B was computed at both monthly and pentad intervals from a January 1 start date and compared to ground measured SWE from intensive and regional snow survey campaigns, and climate station observations. A greater (lower) cumulative change in vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar was significantly related to greater (lower) ground measured SWE (r(2) = 0.77 with monthly averages: r(2) = 0.67 with pentad averages). Sigma vertical bar Delta 37V vertical bar was only weakly correlated with lake fraction: monthly r(2) values calculated for January through April 2003-2007 were largely less than 0.2. These results indicate that this is a computationally straightforward and viable algorithmic framework for producing tundra-specific SWE datasets from the complete satellite passive microwave record (1979 to present).

AB Remote sensing has been widely used for modelling and mapping individual forest structural attributes, such as LAI and stem density, however the development and evaluation of methods for simultaneously modelling and mapping multivariate aspects of forest structure are comparatively limited. Multivariate representation of forest structure can be used as a means to infer other environmental attributes such as biodiversity and habitat, which have often been shown to be enhanced in more structurally diverse or complex forests. Image-based modelling of multivariate forest structure is useful in developing an understanding of the associations between different aspects of vertical and horizontal structure and image characteristics. Models can also be applied spatially to all image pixels to produce maps of multivariate forest structure as an alternative to sample-based field assessment. This research used high spatial resolution multispectral airborne imagery to provide spectral, spatial, and object-based information in the development of a model of multivariate forest structure as represented by twenty-four field variables measured in plots within a temperate hardwood forest in southern Quebec, Canada. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) was used to develop a model that explained a statistically significant proportion of the variance of these structural attributes. The resulting model included image variables representing mostly within-crown and within-shadow brightness variance (texture) as well as elevation, taken from a DEM of the study area. It was applied spatially across the entire study area to produce a continuous map of predicted multivariate forest structure. Bootstrapping validation of the model provided an RMSE of 19.9%, while independent field validation of mapped areas of complex and simple structure showed accuracies of 89% and 69%, respectively. Multiscale testing using resampled imagery suggested that the methods could possibly be used with current pan-sharpened, or future sub-metre resolution, multispectral satellite imagery, which would provide much greater spatial coverage and reduced image processing compared to airborne imagery.

AB We investigate the interannual variability over 2003-2008 of different hydrological parameters in the Amazon river basin: (1) vertically-integrated water storage from the GRACE space gravimetry mission, (2) surface water level of the Amazon River and its tributaries from in situ gauge stations, and (3) precipitation. We analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of total water storage from GRACE and in situ river level along the Amazon River and its main tributaries and note significant differences between the various parts of the basin. We also perform an Empirical Orthogonal Decomposition of total water storage, river level and precipitation over the whole basin. We find that the 2003-2008 period, is characterized by two major hydrological events: a temporary drought in late 2005 that affected the western and central parts of the basin and very wet conditions peaking in mid-2006, in the eastern, northern and southern regions of the basin. Derivative of basin-average water storage from GRACE is shown to be highly correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (a proxy of ENSO - El Nino-Southern Oscillation), confirming that the spatio-temporal change in hydrology of the Amazon basin is at least partly driven by the ENSO phenomenon, as noticed in previous studies.

AB An operational procedure is presented that allows detecting active fires based on information from Meteosat-8/SEVIRI over Africa. The procedure takes advantage of the temporal resolution of SEVIRI (one image every 15 min), and relies on information from SEVIRI channels (namely 0.6, 0.8, 3.9, 10.8 and 12.0 mu m) together with information on illumination angles. The method is based on heritage from contextual algorithms designed for polar, sun-synchronous instruments, namely NOAA/AVHRR and MODIS/TERRA-AQUA. A potential fire pixel is compared with the neighboring ones and the decision is made based on relative thresholds as derived from the pixels in the neighborhood.
   An overview is provided of results obtained for January and July 2007, respectively over Northern Africa (NAfr) and Southern Africa (SAfr), paying special attention to the spatial and temporal distribution of active fires. In both NAfr and SAfr, two types of vegetation clearly dominate in terms of fire activity, namely tree-covered areas, containing 40% of total fires observed, and shrub-covered areas, with 25% (19%) of total fires in NAfr (SAfr). However, marked differences were also to be found between the two regions; more than two-thirds (70%) of fires in SAfr were observed in land cover classes dominated by trees but the proportion is much lower (40%) in the case of NAfr. The duration of active fires in both regions tends to follow two-parameter generalized Pareto distributions, with both the scale and the shape parameters presenting very similar values for NAfr and SAfr.
   An assessment of the robustness of the algorithm, consistency of results and added value of the product was made by studying the daily cycle of fire activity over two regions located in northern and southern hemisphere Africa and by means of systematic comparisons against fire incidence reported in previous works and against hot spots extracted from the global daily active fire product developed by the MODIS Fire Team. The observed fire incidence by land cover class compares well with the results reported in previous works and it is shown that there is an overall coherence between results obtained from SEVIRI and MODIS when adequate spatial and temporal scales are chosen when performing the comparison. Data from MODIS and SEVIRI may be viewed as complementary, the latter having the added value of providing a much finer temporal resolution that allows uncovering certain aspects of fire behavior, namely the characterization of daily fire cycles.

AB This paper presents a technique for mapping erythemally-weighted solar ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from satellite data in a tropical environment. A satellite-based EUV radiation model was formulated for calculating the EUV daily dose from satellite-derived earth-atmospheric albedo, total column ozone and other ground-based ancillary data. The earth-atmospheric albedo was obtained from a geostationary satellite (GMS5) while the total column ozone was retrieved from a polar orbiting satellite (EP/TOMS). The model was validated against the monthly average EUV daily dose from the measurements at four solar radiation monitoring stations located in the tropical environment of Thailand. The monthly average EUV daily dose calculated from the model was in reasonable agreement with that obtained from the measurement, with root mean square difference (RMSD) and mean bias difference (MBD) of 12.3% and 0.7%, respectively. After the validation, the model was used to calculate the monthly average EUV daily dose over Thailand employing an 8-year period of data from GMS5. EP/TOMS and other ancillary surface data. Values of the monthly average of EUV daily dose were presented as monthly and yearly maps. These maps reveal that the tropical monsoons have a strong influence on the EUV in this region.

AB In recognition of the idea that land cover classes are vague phenomena, a number of researchers have advocated modelling of Land Cover as fuzzy sets, as opposed to Boolean sets. Once vagueness is admitted, it is not sufficient to stop at modelling land cover simply as a fuzzy set, because any threshold map (alpha-cut) of the fuzzy set is itself a Boolean set. Rather it may be appropriate to model it as a type 2 fuzzy set recognising the existence of higher order vagueness. Using the example of estimating land cover extents in an area of the forest-savanna ecotone in Bolivia, this paper,presents the results and possible advantages of a type 2 fuzzy analysis of land cover. The consideration of type 2 fuzzy sets reveals the depth of the uncertainty, and allows the analyst to be specific about minimum, maximum, and average extents of land cover types and even to report fuzzy area itself as a fuzzy number and to justify descriptive qualifications of the results. The nuanced analysis, which is possible with this approach, seems an advance for the scientific community concerned with the conceptualisation of land cover classes, but it may be a nuisance for those involved in policy matters.

AB The Fraunhofer Line Discriminator (FLD) principle has long been considered as the reference method to quantify solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) from passive remote sensing measurements. Recently, alternative retrieval algorithms based on the spectral fitting of hyperspectral radiance observations, Spectral Fitting Methods (SFMs), have been proposed. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate the performance of such algorithms and to provide relevant information regarding their use. FLD and SFMs were used to estimate F starting from Top Of Canopy (TOC) fluxes at very high spectral resolution (0.12 nm) and sampling interval (0.1 nm), exploiting the O-2-B (687.0 nm) and O-2-A (760.6 nm) atmospheric oxygen absorption bands overlapping the fluorescence emissions at the red and far-red spectral window.
   Specific parameters affecting FLD and SFM performances are investigated and the accuracy of F estimation of the two methods is compared. The problem related to the lack of independent measurements of Fat canopy level, which prevents the direct assessment of F estimation accuracy with actual measurements, is overcome in this study by using a modeled database of TOC reflectance spectra. In order to compute accuracy figures valid for operative applications the simulated spectra were perturbed by the addition of radiometric noise. An investigation was conducted to determine the best FLD channel configuration; it showed that violation of FLD assumptions results in a positive bias in F estimation at both oxygen absorption bands that cannot be avoided even at the high spectral resolution considered. SFMs were shown to be more accurate than FLD under any noise configuration considered. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present results of snow surface properties using the EWSAT dual frequency altimeter at S (3.2 GHz) and Ku (13.6 GHz) bands and the AMSR-E microwave radiometer at frequencies ranging between 6 and 36 GHz in the Vostok region, East Antarctica. The altimetric time series observed between 2002 and 2008 show variations at 3 different time scales (daily, seasonal and inter-annual), that correlate directly with variations in the snow surface properties. In this study we focus on the analysis of the rapid daily event, occurring on February 14th 2005, that created a jump of the backscatter coefficient of up to 5.3 dB at the S band and 2.5 dB at the Ku band. The ratio of V/H-polarization brightness temperature slowly decreased in December and January 2005, and suddenly increased on February 14th 2005.
   The origin of this rapid event is investigated using AWS data from Vostok station, altimetric and radiometric data simultaneously. Both snow surface density and roughness are found to vary during this event. This event is shown to be synchronous with strong wind occuring during a period of anomalous wind direction, and the presence of surface hoar. These particular conditions certainly modified the snow surface roughness and thus impacted the altimetric signal. We finally investigate the impact of this event on the calculation of the regional ice-sheet mass-balance using different corrections of height with echo shape variations. It is shown to be negligible only if the full echo shape correction (Legresy et al., 2006) is used. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing, in combination with multivariate geostatistical methods, has the potential to improve the prediction of soil properties at landscape scales. In the Everglades region, and particularly in Water Conservation Area 2A (WCA-2A), phosphorus enrichment has drawn a lot of attention and has led to an extensive documentation of different aspects of the degradation of the system. This study presents a hybrid geospatial modeling approach to predict soil total phosphorus (TP) using remotely-sensed data and ancillary landscape properties as supporting variables. Two remote sensors, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM)+ and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), were used to investigate relationships between spectral data and indices and soil TR A variation of a vegetation index (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - NDVI green) was found to be the most effective in predicting floc TP values, due to its capacity to capture small variations in chlorophyll a that are associated to TP levels in periphyton, especially in aquatic/non-impacted areas. On the other hand, NDVI, a more traditionally used vegetation index, was still a good indicator of TP variability, particularly in the soil surface layer, due to its stronger relationship with impacted areas dominated by cattail (Typha domingensis Pers.).
   Findings from this study indicate that: a) remote sensing can play an important role in optimizing monitoring of environmental variables, particularly below-ground properties of floc and soils: b) because of limitations about the numbers and frequency of soil samples that can be taken, the combination of remote sensing and geostatistics could represent a non-invasive and cost-effective method to monitor soil nutrient status in complex wetland systems, and c) variations of traditional remote sensing indices such as NDVI can be used to better capture the spatial variability associated with soil and periphyton TP.

AB Live fuel moisture content (FMC) is a key factor required to evaluate fire risk and its operative and accurate estimation is essential for allocating pre-fire resources as a part of fire prevention. This paper presents an operative and accurate procedure to estimate FMC though MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectrometer) data and simulation models. The new aspects of the method are its consideration of several ecological criteria to parameterize the models and consistently avoid simulating unrealistic spectra which might produce indetermination (ill-posed) problems when inverting the model. The methodology was operatively applicable to 12 shrubland plots located in different provinces of the Mediterranean region of Spain and tested with field data collected in those areas. The results showed that the proposed method efficiently tracks changes of FMC with average errors around 15%. However the model under-estimates FMC values higher than 135.68% since those situations were not included in the simulation scheme and the inversion precision is also dependent on an accurate estimation of LAI. These limitations will be overcome in future work mainly by including spectral signatures of vegetation with FMC values higher than 135.68% in the simulations, and by exploring new methods for LAI retrieval. Further efforts will also be devoted to extend this approach to other ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal Infrared (TIR) data are supplied by instruments on several satellite platforms including the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER), which was launched on the Terra satellite in 1999. ASTER has five bands in the TIR and a spatial resolution of 90 m. A mean seasonal, gridded, Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity (LST&E) database has been produced at 100 m spatial resolution using all the ASTER scenes acquired for the months of Jan-Mar (winter) and Jul-Sep (summer) over North America. Version 2.0 of the North American ASTER Land Surface Database (NAALSED) (http://emissivity.jpl.nasa.gov) has now been released and includes two key refinements designed to improve the accuracy of emissivities over water bodies and account for the effects of fractional vegetation cover. The water adjustment replaces ASTER emissivity values over inland water bodies with a measured library emissivity spectrum of distilled water, and then re-calculates the surface temperatures using a split-window algorithm. The accuracy of ASTER emissivities over vegetated surfaces is improved by applying a fractional vegetation cover adjustment (TES_Pv) to the ASTER Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) calibration curve. Comparisons of NAALSED emissivity spectra with in-situ data measured over a grassland in Northern Texas resulted in a combined absolute difference for all five ASTER bands of 1.0% for the summer emissivity data, and 0.1% for the winter data-a 33-50% improvement over the original TES results.

AB Remote sensing provides a broad view of landscapes and can be consistent through time, making it an important tool for monitoring and managing protected areas. An impediment to broader use of remote sensing science for monitoring has been the need for resource managers to understand the specialized capabilities of an ever-expanding array of image sources and analysis techniques. Here, we provide guidelines that will enable land managers to more effectively collaborate with remote sensing scientists to develop and apply remote sensing science to achieve monitoring objectives. We first describe fundamental characteristics of remotely sensed data and change detection analysis that affect the types and range of phenomena that can be tracked. Using that background, we describe four general steps in natural resource remote sensing projects: image and reference data acquisition, pre-processing, analysis, and evaluation. We emphasize the practical considerations that arise in each of these steps. We articulate a four-phase process that guides natural resource and remote sensing specialists through a collaborative process to articulate goals, evaluate data and options for image processing, refine or eliminate unrealistic paths, and assess the cost and utility of different options.

AB Progress in assessing the feasibility for imaging fluorescence using the O-2-A band with 1 mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) bands centered at 757.5 and 760.5 nm is reported in this paper. Multispectral airborne data was acquired at 150 m above ground level in the thermal, visible and near infrared regions yielding imagery at 15 cm spatial resolution. Simultaneous field experiments conducted in olive, peach, and orange orchards (water stress trials), and an olive orchard (variety trial) enabled the detected variability in fluorescence emission to be examined as function of stress status. In a parallel modelling activity the coupled leaf-canopy reflectance-fluorescence model, FluorMOD, was used to assess fluorescence retrieval capability by the in-filling method, as well as by fluorescence indices from the published literature. Fluorescence retrievals using the in-filling method, the derivative index D702/D680 and reflectance indices R690/R630, R761-R757, and R761/R757 yielded the best results in the simulation study, while demonstrating insensitivity to leaf area index (LAI) variation. The fluorescence in-filling method, derivative index D702/D680, and R761-R757 were the indices least affected by chlorophyll a + b (Cab) variation. On the other hand, other published indices for fluorescence detection at leaf and canopy levels exhibited high sensitivity to variations in Cab and LAI, and therefore were considered less suitable for in-field fluorescence detection. The fluorescence signal extraction from airborne imagery using the in-filling method was validated through comparisons with field-measured steady-state fluorescence (Fs) using the PAM-2100 and GFS-3000 instruments, confirming simulation predictions. The water stress experiments conducted on olive and peach orchards demonstrated the feasibility of chlorophyll fluorescence (F) extraction at the tree level from the airborne imagery, yielding determination coefficients r(2)=0.57 (olive), and r(2)=0.54 (peach). Consistent results were obtained between airborne F and ground truth assimilation (A) measured in the olive variety field experiment under no water stress levels, yielding r(2)=0.71.

AB Optical methods for snow mapping typically exploit wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared range, where reflectances from snow and snow-free ground may significantly vary, especially during the melting season. In this study, the variability of ground reflectance in the boreal forest zone was investigated in order to assess the feasibility of satellite sensors to the mapping of snow covered area (SCA). This aims at the improvement of the existing snow mapping algorithms, such as the reflectance model-based snow monitoring method SCAmod of the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE). We acquired and identified some statistical features for reflectance spectra of seasonally snow covered and snow-free terrain by using a field spectro radiometer (ASD Field Spec Pro JR). Extensive measurement campaigns were carried out in 20072008 in northern Finland, resulting to hundreds of spectral samples between 350 and 2500 nm. The main emphasis was put on the determination of the melting snow reflectance under different weather conditions and stages of snow metamorphosis as well as over different terrain types. The gained reflectance spectra provide useful information for optical snow mapping studies in general. In this investigation, the primary function of the spectrometer data was the accuracy assessment and optimal band selection when applying the SCAmod-method to different space-borne instruments (MODIS, MERIS and AVHRR). The correspondence of small scale field observations with scene reflectance was also addressed. This was performed by comparing field spectrometer data with mast-based observations.
   Based on the inversibility of the SCAmod reflectance model, we addressed the standard deviation (standard error) of SCA estimation contributed by wet snow and snow-free ground reflectance fluctuations. An average error in the determination of the fractional Snow Covered Area (SCA) of about 5-7 %-units was obtained (range from 0% = snow-free ground to 100%= full snowcover), the maximum error of 10-12 %-units occurring at full snow cover conditions (for the moment when first open patches are emerging). These investigations show that the variability in the reflectances of snow and snow-free ground is a significant error source in snow mapping. However, providing the SCA with descriptive error statistics is very beneficial for further use as the error statistics are needed for data assimilation approaches, e.g. in using SCA-values as input to hydrological models.

AB There is an urgent need for techniques to rapidly and periodically measure biodiversity and ecosystem services over large landscapes. Conventional vegetation classification and mapping approaches are based on discrete arbitrary classes which do not capture gradual changes in forest type (and corresponding biodiversity and ecosystem services values) from site to site. We developed a simple multi-date NDVI based Mahalanobis distance measure (called eco-climatic distance) that quantifies forest type variability across a moisture gradient for complex tropical forested landscapes on a single ecologically interpretable, continuous scale. This Mahalanobis distance, unlike other distance measures takes into account the variability in the reference class and shared information amongst bands as it is based on the covariance matrix, and therefore is most useful to summarize ecological distance of a pixel to a reference class in multi-band remotely sensed space In this study we successfully apply this measure as a surrogate for tree biodiversity and ecosystem services at two nested scales for the Western Chats Bio-diversity hotspot. Data from over 500 tree-plots and forest type maps was used to test the ability of this remotely sensed distance to be a surrogate for abundance based tree-species compositional turn-over and as a continuous measure of forest type and ecosystem services. Our results suggest a strong but scale dependant relationship between the remotely-sensed distance measure and floristic distance between plots. The multi-date NDVI distance measure emerges as very good quantitative surrogate for forest type and is a useful complement to existing forest classification systems. This surrogate quantifies forest type variability on a single, continuous quantitative scale and has important applications in conservation planning and mapping and monitoring of hydrologic and carbon storage and sequestration services.

AB This paper presents a methodology for water stress detection in crop canopies using a radiative transfer modelling approach and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). Airborne imagery was acquired with a 6-band multispectral camera yielding 15 cm spatial resolution and 10 nm FWHM over 3 crops comprising two tree-structured orchards and a corn field. The methodology is based on the PRI as a water stress indicator, and a radiative transfer modelling approach to simulate PRI baselines for non-stress conditions as a function of leaf structure, chlorophyll concentration (Cab), and canopy leaf area index (LAI). The simulation work demonstrates that canopy PRI is affected by structural parameters such as LAI, Cab, leaf structure, background effects, viewing angle and sun position. The modelling work accounts for such leaf biochemical and canopy structural inputs to simulate the PRI-based water stress thresholds for non-stress conditions. Water stress levels are quantified by comparing the image-derived PRI and the simulated non-stress PRI (sPRI) obtained through radiative transfer. PRI simulation was conducted using the coupled PROSPECT-SAILH models for the corn field, and the PROSPECT leaf model coupled with FLIGHT 3D radiative transfer model for the olive and peach orchards. Results obtained confirm that PRI is a pre-visual indicator of water stress, yielding good relationships for the three crops studied with canopy temperature, an indicator of stomatal conductance (r(2) = 0.65 for olive, r(2) = 0.8 for peach, and r(2) = 0.72 for maize). PRI values of deficit irrigation treatments in olive and peach were consistently higher than the modelled PRI for the study sites, yielding relationships with water potential (r(2) = 0.84) that enabled the identification of stressed crowns accounting for within-field LAI and Cab variability. The methodology presented here for water stress detection is based on the visible part of the spectrum, and therefore it has important implications for remote sensing applications in agriculture. This method may be a better alternative to using the thermal region, which has limitations to acquire operationally high spatial resolution thermal imagery. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB The amount of human altered land surface within a watershed has long been known to influence the biota of receiving streams and waterways. In contrast, vegetation in riparian zones can filter pollutants and reduce flow velocities that incise stream channels. We examined the relationship between the built environment and water quality for streams (1st through 4th order) across three physiographic provinces of the State of Maryland, USA, including 59 watersheds with some 865 stream sampling locations. We used image data products capable of discriminating fine-scale information of the land surface, including proportional impervious, tree, grass and crop cover. Stepwise multiple linear regression and decision tree statistical approaches were used to assess the relationship between the land cover predictors and benthic indices of biological integrity (BIBI) and number of sensitive invertebrate taxa (NEPT), response variables derived from the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS). Impervious and tree cover were found to be the best predictors of stream biota, although this varied with physiographic province and the response variable of interest. The best multivariate models predicted 65% of variability in BIBI and 62% of NEPT (p<0.001). The configuration of tree cover across the landscape and the distance of land cover to the stream channel was found to be important in many, but not all cases for improving the predictive quality of statistical models estimating stream biota metrics. This work advances the estimation of stream health characteristics in areas where MBSS measurements do not exist but can be estimated using comparable land cover information, and informs guidelines for management and restoration.

AB Nutrient enrichment and eutrophication are major concerns in many estuarine and wetland ecosystems, and the need is urgent for fast, efficient, and synoptic ways to detect and monitor nutrients in wetlands and other coastal systems across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We integrated three approaches in a multi-disciplinary evaluation of the potential for using hyperspectral imaging as a tool to assess nutrient enrichment and vegetation responses in tidal wetlands. For hyperspectral imaging to be an effective tool, spectral signatures must vary in ways correlated with water nutrient content either directly, or indirectly via such proxies as vegetation responses to elevated nitrogen. Working in Elkhorn Slough, central California, where intensive farming practices generate considerable runoff of fertilizers and pesticides, we looked first for long- and short-term trends among temporally ephemeral point data for nutrients and other water quality characters collected monthly at 18 water sampling stations since 1988. Second, we assessed responses of the dominant wetland plant, Salicornia virginica (common pickleweed) to two fertilizer regimes in 0.25 m(2) experimental plots, and measured changes in tissue composition (C, H, N), biomass, and spectral responses at leaf and at canopy scales. Third, we used HyMap hyperspectral imagery (126 bands; 15-19 nm spectral resolution: 2.5 m spatial resolution) for a synoptic assessment of the entire wetland ecosystem of Elkhorn Slough. We mapped monospecific Salicornia patches (similar to 56-500 m(2)) on the ground adjacent to the 18 regular water sampling sites, and then located these patches in the hyperspectral imagery to correlate long-term responses of larger patches to water nutrient regimes. These were used as standards for correlating plant canopy spectral responses with nitrogen variation described by the water sampling program. There were consistent positive relationships between nitrogen levels and plant responses in both the field experiment and the landscape analyses. Two spectral indices, the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) and Derivative Chlorophyll Index (DCI), were correlated significantly with water nutrients. We conclude that hyperspectral imagery can be used to detect nutrient enrichment across three spatial and at least two temporal scales. and suggest that more quantitative information could be extracted with further research and a greater understanding of physiological and physical mechanisms linking water chemistry, plant properties and spectral imaging characteristics.

AB Understanding, monitoring and modelling attributes of seagrass biodiversity, Such as species composition, richness, abundance, spatial patterns, and disturbance dynamics, requires spatial information. This work assessed the accuracy of commonly available airborne hyper-spectral and satellite multi-spectral image data sets for mapping seagrass species composition, horizontal horizontal-projected foliage cover and above-ground dry-weight biomass. The work was carried out on the Eastern Banks in Moreton Bay, Australia, an area of shallow and clear coastal waters, containing a range of seagrass species, cover and biomass levels. Two types of satellite image data were used: Quickbird-2 multi-spectral and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper multi-spectral. Airborne hyper-spectral image data were acquired from a CASI-2 sensor using a pixel size of 4.0 m. The mapping was constrained to depths shallower than 3.0 m, based on past modelling of the separability of seagrass reflectance signatures at increasing water depths. Out results demonstrated that mapping of seagrass cover, species and biomass to high accuracy levels (>80%) was riot possible across all image types. For each parameter mapped, airborne hyper-spectral data produced the highest overall accuracies (46%), followed by Quickbird-2 and then Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper. The low accuracy levels were attributed to the mapping methods and difficulties in matching locations on image and field data sets. Accurate mapping of seagrass cover, species composition and biomass, using simple approaches, requires further work using high-spatial resolution (<5 m) and/or hyper-spectral image data. Further work is required to determine if and how the seagrass maps produced in this work are Suitable for measuring attributes of seagrass biodiversity, and using these data for modelling floral and fauna biodiversity properties of seagrass environments, and for scaling-up seagrass ecosystem models.

AB Change detection based on the comparison of independently classified images (i.e. post-classification comparison) is well-known to be negatively affected by classification errors of individual maps. Incorporating spatial-temporal contextual information in the classification helps to reduce the classification errors, thus improving change detection results. In this paper, spatial-temporal Markov Random Fields (MRF) models were used to integrate spatial-temporal information with spectral information for multi-temporal classification in an attempt to mitigate the impacts of classification errors on change detection. One important component in spatial-temporal MRF models is the specification of transition probabilities. Traditionally, a global transition probability model is used that assumes spatial stationarity of transition probabilities across an image scene, which may be invalid if areas have varying transition probabilities. By relaxing the stationarity assumption, we developed two local transition probability models to make the transition model locally adaptive to spatially varying transition probabilities. The first model called locally adjusted global transition model adapts to the local variation by multiplying a pixel-wise probability of change with the global transition model. The second model called pixel-wise transition model was developed as a fully local model based on the estimation of the pixel-wise joint probabilities. When applied to the forest change detection in Paraguay, the two local models showed significant improvements in the accuracy of identifying the change from forest to non-forest compared with traditional models. This indicates that the local transition probability models can present temporal information more accurately in change detection algorithms based on spatial-temporal classification of multi-temporal images. The comparison between the two local transition models showed that the fully local model better captured the spatial heterogeneity of the transition probabilities and achieved more stable and consistent results over different regions of a large image scene.

AB The dynamics of foliar chlorophyll concentrations have considerable significance for plant-environment interactions, ecosystem functioning and crop growth. Hyperspectral remote sensing has a valuable role in the monitoring of such dynamics. This study focussed upon improving the accuracy of chlorophyll quantification by applying wavelet analysis to reflectance spectra. Leaf-scale radiative transfer models were used to generate very large spectral data sets with which to develop and rigorously test refinements to the approach and compare it with existing spectral indices. The results demonstrated that by decomposing leaf spectra, the resultant wavelet coefficients can be used to generate accurate predictions of chlorophyll concentration, despite wide variations in the range of other biochemical and biophysical factors that influence leaf reflectance. Wavelet analysis outperformed predictive models based on untransformed spectra and a range of spectral indices. The paper discusses the possibilities for further refining the wavelet approach and for extending the technique to the sensing of a variety of vegetation properties at a range of spatial scales.

AB Snow is an important land cover on the earth's surface. It is characterized by its changing nature. Monitoring snow cover extent plays a significant role in dynamic studies and prevention of snow-caused disasters in pastoral areas. Using NASA EOS Terra/MODIS snow cover products and in situ observation data during the four snow seasons from November 1 to March 31 of year 2001 to 2005 in northern Xinjiang area, the accuracy of MODIS snow cover mapping algorithm under varied snow depth and land cover types was analyzed. The overall accuracy of MODIS daily snow cover mapping algorithm in clear sky condition is high at 98.5%; snow agreement reaches 98.2%, and ranges from 77.8% to 100% over the 4-year period for individual sites. Snow depth (SD) is one of the major factors affecting the accuracy of MODIS snow cover maps. MODIS does not identify any snow for SD less than 0.5 cm. The overall accuracy increases with snow depth if SD is equal to or greater than 3 cm, and decreases for SD below 3 cm. Land cover has an important influence in the accuracy of MODIS snow cover maps. The use of MOD10A1 snow cover products is severely affected by cloud cover. The 8-day composite products of MOD10A2 can effectively minimize the effect of cloud cover in most cases. Cloud cover in excess of 10% occurs on 99% of the MOD10A1 products and 14.7% of the MOD10A2 products analyzed during the four snow seasons. User-defined multiple day composite images based on MOD10A1, with flexibilities of selecting composite period, starting and ending date and composite sequence of MOD10A1 products, have an advantage in effectively monitoring snow cover extent for regional snow-caused disasters in pastoral areas.

AB Water skin temperature derived from thermal infrared satellite data are used in a wide variety of studies. Many of these studies would benefit from frequent, high spatial resolution (100 m pixels) thermal imagery but currently, at any given location, such data are only available every few weeks from spaceborne sensors such as ASTER. Lower spatial resolution (1 km pixels) thermal imagery is available multiple times per day at any given location, from several sensors such as MODIS on board both the AQUA and TERRA satellite platforms. In order to fully exploit lower spatial resolution imagery, a sub-pixel unmixing technique has been developed and tested at Quesnel Lake, British Columbia, Canada. This approach produces accurate, frequent high spatial resolution water skin temperature maps by exploiting a priori knowledge of water boundaries derived from vectorized water features. The pixel water-fraction maps are then input to a gradient descent algorithm to solve the mixed pixel ground leaving radiance equation for sub-pixel water temperature. Ground-leaving radiance is estimated from standard temperature and emissivity data products for pure pixels and a simple regression technique to estimate atmospheric effects. In this test case, MODIS 1 km thermal imagery was used along with 1:50,000 water features to create a high-resolution (100 m) water skin temperature map. This map is compared to a concurrent ASTER temperature image and found to be within 1 degrees C of the ASTER skin temperature 99% of the time. This is a considerable improvement over the 2.55 degrees C difference between the original MODIS product and ASTER image due to land temperature contamination. The algorithm is simple, effective, and unlocks a largely untapped resource for limnological and hydrological studies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The third POLDER. (POLarization and Directionality of the Earth Reflectance) instrument, PARASOL (Polarization & Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar) was launched in December 2004 and started its operational life at the early beginning of March 2005. This study is devoted to the regional validation of PARASOL aerosol retrieval scheme over land surfaces against independent automatic sun-photometers located in the northeast part of China at the Beijing and Xianghe sites both included in AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network). PARASOL Level 2 Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) is shown, thanks to the high quality sun-photometer dataset, to be quite consistent with the AERONET AOT of the fine fractional part of the size distribution (radius <= 0.3 mu m). In other words, PARASOL retrieval over land is mainly sensitive to the anthropogenic aerosols which are known for influencing the climate, environment as well as human health. Moreover, analysis of polarization in the 490 ran band (Level I data) shows the possibility of dust type aerosol identification thus yielding to a potential algorithm improvement in the future.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), onboard the NASA Terra and Aqua Earth Observing System satellites, provides multiple land surface temperature (LST) products on a daily basis. However, these products have not been adequately validated. This paper presents preliminary results of validating two MODIS Terra daily LST products, MOD11_L2 (version 4) and MOD07_L2 (version 4), using the FLUXNET and Carbon Europe Integrated Project (CarboEurope-IP) long-term ground measurements over eight vegetated sites. Since ground-measured LSTs were only available over one fixed point in each validation site, the study was carefully designed to mitigate the scale mismatch issue by using nighttime ground measurements concurrent to more than 1800 MODIS Terra overpasses.
   The preliminary results show that MOD11-L2 LSTs have smaller absolute biases and root mean squared errors (RMSE) than those of MOD07-L2 LSTs in most cases. The match of MOD11_L2 LSTs with ground measurements in the Brookings, Audubon, Canaan Valley, and Black Hills sites is good, yielding absolute biases less than 0.8 degrees C and RMSEs less than 1.7 degrees C. In the Fort Peck, Hainich, Tharandt, and Bondville sites, MOD11_L2 LSTs were underestimated by 2-3 degrees C. Biases in MOD11-L2 LSTs correlate to those in MOD07_L2 LSTs. Since the MOD07_L2 LST product is one of the input parameters to the MOD11_L2 LST algorithm, biases in MOD11_L2 LSTs may be influenced by biases in MOD07_L2 LSTs. The errors in both products depend weakly on sensor view zenith angle but are independent of surface air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and soil moisture. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new method is described for the retrieval of fractional cover of large woody plants (shrubs) at the landscape scale using moderate resolution multi-angle remote sensing data from the Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and a hybrid geometric-optical (GO) canopy reflectance model. Remote sensing from space is the only feasible method for regularly mapping woody shrub cover over large areas, an important application because extensive woody shrub encroachment into former grasslands has been seen in and and semi-arid grasslands around the world during the last 150 years. The major difficulty in applying GO models in desert grasslands is the spatially dynamic nature of the combined soil and understory background reflectance: the background is important and cannot be modeled as either a Lambertian scatterer or by using a fixed bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Candidate predictors of the background BRDF at the Sun-target-MISR angular sampling configurations included the volume scattering kernel weight from a Li-Ross BRDF model; diffuse brightness (p0) from the Modified Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (MRPV) BRDF model; other Li-Ross kernel weights (isotropic, geometric); and MISR near-nadir bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) in the blue, green, and near infra-red bands. The best method was multiple regression on the weights of a kemel-driven model and MISR nadir camera blue, green, and near infra-red bidirectional reflectance factors. The results of forward modeling BRFs for a 5.25 km(2) area in the USDA, ARS Jomada Experimental Range using the Simple Geometric Model (SGM) with this background showed good agreement with the MISR data in both shape and magnitude, with only minor spatial discrepancies. The simulations were shown to be accurate in terms of both absolute value and reflectance anisotropy over all 9 MISR views and for a wide range of canopy configurations (r(2)=0.78, RMSE=0.013, N=3969). Inversion of the SGM allowed estimation of fractional shrub cover with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.03 but a relatively weak correlation (r(2)=0.19)with the reference data (shrub cover estimated from high resolution IKONOS panchromatic imagery). The map of retrieved fractional shrub cover was an approximate spatial match to the reference map. Deviations reflect the first-order approximation of the understory BRDF in the MISR viewing plane; errors in the shrub statistics; and the 12 month lag between the two data sets.

AB The components of the forest radiative transfer model FRT developed at Tartu Observatory, Estonia are compared to the results of measurements of forest canopy downward radiance under forest canopy. Measurements were performed with a hemispheric-view imaging CCD-radiometer which was specially designed for this task. A thorough study of metrological properties of the radiometer was carried out and the respective preprocessing algorithms were created. The angular distribution of view probabilities and NIR radiances for tree crowns, trunks and canopy gaps are measured and compared to the model simulations for two coniferous and a broadleaf forests. Generally, the model reproduced the angular courses of component probabilities and NIR radiances rather well, however, in some cases problems with both the absolute levels of radiance and the angular course arose.

AB Remote sensing of ocean color from space, a problem that consists of retrieving spectral marine reflectance from spectral top-of-atmosphere reflectance, is considered as a collection of similar inverse problems continuously indexed by the angular variables influencing the observation process. A general solution is proposed in the form of a field of non-linear regression models over the set T of permitted values for the angular variables, i.e., as a map from T to some function space. Each value of the field is a regression model that performs a direct mapping from the top-of-atmosphere reflectance to the marine reflectance. Since the spectral components of the field take values in the same variable vector space, the retrievals in individual spectral bands are not independent, i.e., the solution is not just a juxtaposition of independent models for each spectral band. A scheme based on ridge functions is developed to approximate this solution to an arbitrary accuracy, and is applied to the retrieval of marine reflectance in Case 1 waters, for which optical properties are only governed by biogenic content. The statistical models are evaluated on synthetic data as well as actual data originating from the SeaWiFS instrument, taking into account noise in the data. Theoretical performance is good in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalization capabilities, suggesting that the function field methodology might improve atmospheric correction in the presence of absorbing aerosols and provide more accurate estimates of marine reflectance in productive waters. When applied to SeaWiFS imagery acquired off California, the function field methodology gives generally higher estimates of marine reflectance than the standard SeaDAS algorithm, but the values are more realistic.

AB The main objective of this paper is the validation of CYCLOPES version 3.1 LAI and fAPAR products. It is achieved by the comparison with MODIS collection 4 and 4.1 products and ECOCLIMAP LAI climatology over the BELMANIP representative set of sites, and with ground measurements over a limited set of sites. Great attention is paid to the consistency of the comparison: for the spatial dimension, product PSF appears to be the main aspect governing the spatial resolution at which the comparison has to be achieved. For CYCLOPES, a minimal size of the sites should be 3 km x 3 km(2), while the optimal one is 10 km x 10 km; regarding the temporal sampling interval and resolution, the problem is much easier to solve when assuming a relatively smooth time course of vegetation characteristics (8-16 days). Great care was also paid to the departure of products from the nominal definition, particularly for LAI where different scales of clumping have to be considered.
   Results showed that CYCLOPES and MODlS products have generally consistent seasonality, CYCLOPES being however characterized by a smoother temporal evolution as expected. Differences are mainly concentrated on the magnitude of products values, CYCLOPES achieving better performances both for LAI (RMSE=0.73) and fAPAR (RMSE=0.10) over the limited number of sites where ground measurements were available. This study also sets a framework to the validation exercise that could be used to evaluate other products or future versions of the same products and contribute to associate quantitative uncertainties as required by the user community.

AB Remote sensing is a potentially powerful technology with which to extrapolate eddy covariance-based gross primary production (GPP) to continental scales. In support of this concept, we used meteorological and flux data from the AmeriFlux network and Support Vector Machine (SVM), an inductive machine learning technique, to develop and apply a predictive GPP model for the conterminous U.S. In the following four-step process, we first trained the SVM to predict flux-based GPP from 33 AmeriFlux sites between 2000 and 2003 using three remotely-sensed variables (land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land cover) and one ground-measured variable (incident shortwave radiation). Second, we evaluated model performance by predicting GPP for 24 available AmeriFlux sites in 2004. In this independent evaluation, the SVM predicted GPP with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.87 gC/m(2)/day and an R-2 of 0.71. Based on annual total GPP at 15 AmeriFlux sites for which the number of 8-day averages in 2004 was no less than 67%(30 out of a possible 45), annual SVM GPP prediction error was 32.1% for non-forest ecosystems and 22.2% for forest ecosystems, while the standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer GPP product (MOD17) had an error of 50.3% for non-forest ecosystems and 21.5% for forest ecosystems, suggesting that the regionally tuned SVM performed better than the standard global MOD 17 GPP for non-forest ecosystems but had similar performance for forest ecosystems. The most important explanatory factor for GPP prediction was EVI, removal of which increased GPP RMSE by 0.85 gC/m2/day in a cross-validation experiment. Third, using the SVM driven by remote sensing data including incident shortwave radiation, we predicted 2004 conterminous U.S. GPP and found that results were consistent with expected spatial and temporal patterns. Finally, as an illustration of SVM GPP for ecological applications, we estimated maximum light use efficiency (e(max)), one of the most important factors for standard light use efficiency models, for the conterminous U.S. by integrating the 2004 SVM GPP with the MOD17 GPP algorithm. We found that emax varied from similar to 0.86 gC/MJ in grasslands to similar to 1.56 gC/MJ in deciduous forests, while MOD17 emax was 0.68 gC/MJ for grasslands and 1.16 gC/MJ for deciduous forests, suggesting that refinements of MOD17 emax may be beneficial. 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB Climate change in the Arctic will differentially affect physiological rates, leaf phenology, and species composition of tundra, resulting in changing patterns and magnitudes of ecosystem CO2 flux. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) provides a potential means to infer changes in CO2 flux, but whether relationships developed between NDVI and flux components can be generalized across the entire growing season and in response to changes induced by climate warming is uncertain. To investigate how well such changes might be assessed using inultispectral digital images, ecosystem CO2 fluxes and NDVI were compared throughout the 2002 growing season on experimental plots with increased growing season length and soil temperature at Toolik Lake, Alaska. Season length was increased by snow removal early in the season and soil terriperatures were increased using heating cables. Carbon dioxide fluxes were measured using static chamber techniques and corresponding NDVI images were taken with an agricultural digital camera. The seasonal patterns of NDVI in all treatments showed an increase to a peak in early August followed by an abrupt decline, with the snow removal plots phenologically advanced compared to the controls. Net ecosystem production (NEP) showed uptake of CO2 early in the season leveling out to a Slight loss Of CO2 at peak season for both control and extended season plots. Gross primary productivity (GPP) closely followed the pattern of NDVI and the pattern of ecosystem respiration (R,) mirrored that of GPP. NDVI was significantly correlated to GPP and ecosystem respiration (R-2 =0.50 and 0.36 respectively) across plots, dates, and treatments combined. However, most of the covariation was across dates. After accounting for seasonal variation, NDVI never accounted for more than 25% of the remaining variation in flux measures. Analysis of covariance showed that a given NDVI value corresponded to different flux rates on different dates and to different R-e among treatments after correcting for date. The slopes of the NDVI-GPP and NDVI-Re relationships were much steeper across dates than across plots. These plot-scale results suggest that NDVI alone is not sufficient to estimate carbon flux rate responses to climate change across space or years. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We tested the use of the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) for detecting oil spills in the Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, that were caused by a series of accidents between December 2002 and March 2003. The MISR sensor, onboard the Terra satellite, utilises nine cameras pointed at fixed angles, ranging from nadir to +/- 70.5 degrees. Based upon the Bidirectional Reflectance Factor, a contrast function and a classification accuracy assessment, it is shown, for two images examined under sun glint conditions, that the MISR sensor provides a better capability for oil spill discrimination, than the single-view MODIS-250 m data. Analysis of the multi-angle MISR red band indicates that oil spills appear with greater contrast in those view angles affected by sun glitter as a result of local changes in surface roughness caused by the hydrocarbons. Although limited by cloud cover, the capability of the MISR instrument for oil spill discrimination, together with its weekly temporal resolution and open data access, have the potential for improving the operational monitoring of oil releases.

AB An algorithm for retrieving simultaneously aerosol and surface optical properties from radiance data of the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) was developed. It uses MISR subregion radiance data of the 9 cameras and 4 spectral bands (spatial resolution 1. 1 km) to generate characteristic functions rho(surf)=f(lambda,cam) (beta(e) (550 nm)), where beta(e) (550 nm) and rho(surf) are the ground level aerosol extinction coefficient at 550 nm, and the surface reflectance, respectively. The analysis of the mutual intersections of those functions yield optimum values for P, (550 nm), aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm and p(surf). MODTRAN 4 v3r1 was used to create radiance look-up tables. The algorithm was tested for MISR paths covering the complex terrain of Switzerland and northern Italy. Results of 2 days (low and high aerosol loads on May 14 and June 17, 2002, respectively) were analyzed and compared with sun photometer measurements. First, ground level aerosol extinction coefficients and optical depth over water were derived. From those data it was possible to retrieve a best-fit aerosol mixture. AOD (550 nm) over water is in satisfactory agreement with both sun photometer data and the operational aerosol product of MISR. Second, the Ross-Li approach for the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF), supported by MODTRAN 4, was applied to simulate the radiance over vegetation surfaces. In this case, the retrieved aerosol extinction coefficients and optical depths over vegetation are significantly lower than the values derived over water. We assume that the incomplete coupling of BRF and radiation in MODTRAN 4 is at least partly responsible for this discrepancy. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The direct retrieval of canopy height and the estimation of aboveground biomass are two important measures of forest structure that can be quantified by airborne laser scanning at landscape scales. These and other metrics are central to studies attempting to quantify global carbon cycles and to improve understanding of the spatial variation in forest structure evident within differing biomes. Data acquired using NASA's Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) over the Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF) in central New Hampshire (USA) was used to assess the performance of waveform lidar in a northern temperate mixed conifer and deciduous forest.
   Using coincident plots established for this study, we found strong agreement between field and lidar measurements of height (r(2)=0.80, 2 p < 0.000) at the footprint level. Allometric calculations of aboveground biomass (AGBM) and LVIS metrics (AGBM: r(2)=0.61, PRESS RMSE=58.0 Mg ha(-1), p < 0.000) and quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD) and LVIS metrics (r(2) = 0.54, p = 0.002) also showed good agreement at the footprint level. Application of a generalized equation for determining AGBM proposed by Lefsky et a]. (2002a) to footprint-level field data from Bartlett resulted in a coefficient of determination of 0.55; RMSE = 64.4 Mg ha(-1); p 0.002. This is slightly weaker than the strongest relationship found with the best-fit single term regression model.
   Relationships between a permanent grid of USDA Forest Service inventory plots and the mean values of aggregated LVIS metrics, however, were not as strong. This discrepancy suggests that validation efforts must be cautious in using pre-existing field data networks as a sole means of calibrating and verifying such remote sensing data. Stratification based on land-use or species composition, however, did provide the means to improve regression relationships at this scale. Regression models established at the footprint level for AGBM and QMSD were applied to LVIS data to generate predicted values for the whole of Bartlett. The accuracy of these models was assessed using varying subsets of the USFS NERS plot data. Coefficient of determinations ranged from fair to strong with aspects of land-use history and species composition influencing both the fit and the level of error seen in the predicted relationships.

A similarity measure based directly on the components of the Discrete Fourier Transform is used to determine a pixels class membership. This Fourier component similarity measure produces an objective, computationally inexpensive and rapid method of classification that is able to classify rangeland vegetation by dominant shrub type, and which performs favorably compared to previously published classification techniques. By also defining a Fourier component based coverage measure this technique provides an estimate of vegetation coverage. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID ALTIMETER MEASUREMENTS
AB Satellite radar altimeters and scatterometers deployed over ice sheets experience backscatter from the surface and from within the snowpack, termed surface and volume backscatter respectively. In order to assess the errors in satellite altimeter measurements it is vital to know where the return is originating from in the snowpack. This return can vary spatially and temporally. Seasonal variations in the volume backscatter can be a major complicating factor in the radar return from the percolation zone. Ground-based step-frequency radar was deployed in the percolation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet at similar to 1945 m elevation (69 51 N, 47 15W). Previous measurements in this area made by scientists from the Byrd Polar Research Centre and the University of Kansas, undertaken prior to summer melt events, have shown the strongest backscatter from ice features at around 1 m depth buried beneath the previous end-of-summer surface. In autumn 2004, radar measurements in the Ku band with bandwidths of 1 and 8 GHz were made alongside detailed stratigraphic observations within a 1 km(2) site. The radar results revealed no continuous reflecting horizons in the upper 3.5 m of the firn. Shallow cores and snowpits also indicated that there were no spatially continuous stratigraphic horizons across the study site. An average electromagnetic wave velocity of 2.11 +/- 0.05 x 10(8) m s(-1) was determined for the upper metre of the firn. Surface and volume backscatter at vertical incidence were calculated using a standard model. The contribution of the surface backscatter to the total backscatter was on average 6 dB higher than that of the volume backscatter. However, at the higher 8 GHz bandwidth the strongest return frequently originated not from the surface but from within the upper 30 cm of the snowpack, most probably from thin ice layers. At 1 GHz bandwidth these ice layers were not always resolved; their return merged with the surface return, causing it to broaden, with the peak and leading edge moving down. Modelling using density and thickness measurements from shallow cores and snowpits showed that the backscatter from these shallow, thin ice layers could be stronger than the surface return owing to constructive interference from the top and base of the layers.

AB Using field data, Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery, and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, a multi-scale analysis of ecosystem optical proper-ties was performed for Sky Oaks, a Southern California chaparral ecosystem in the spectral network (SpecNet) and FLUXNET networks. The study covered a 4-year period (2000-2004), which included a severe drought in 2002 and a subsequent wildfire in July 2003, leading to extreme perturbation in ecosystem productivity and optical properties. Two vegetation greenness indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)), and a measure of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (WAR), were compared across sampling platforms, which ranged in pixel size from 1m (tram system in the field) to 1000m (MODIS satellite sensor). The three MODIS products closely followed the same seasonal trends as the tram and AVIRIS data, but tended to be higher than the tram and AVIRIS values, particularly for fPAR and NDVI. Following a wildfire that removed all green vegetation, the overestimation in MODIS MAR values was particularly clear. The MODIS MAR algorithm (version 4 vs. v.4.1) had a significant effect on the degree of overestimation, with v. 4.1 improving the agreement with the other sensors (AVIRIS and tram) for vegetated conditions, but not for low, post-fire values. The differences between MODIS products and the products from the other platform sensors could not be entirely attributed to differences in sensor spectral responses or sampling scale. These results are consistent with several other recently published studies that indicate that MODIS overestimates MAR and thus net primary production (NPP) for many terrestrial ecosystems, and demonstrates the need for proper validation of MODIS terrestrial biospheric products by direct comparison against optical signals at other spatial scales, as is now possible at several SpecNet sites. The study also demonstrates the utility of in-situ field sampling (e.g. tram systems) and hyperspectral aircraft imagery for proper interpretation of satellite data taken at coarse spatial scales.

AB The paper describes the design and operation of a multi-angle spectrometer (MAS) for automatic measurement of near-field spectral reflectances of plant canopies at hourly intervals. A novel feature of the instrument is a rotating periscope connected to a spectrometer via a fiber optic cable. Canopy reflectances are calculated for multiple view azimuths, at a single zenith angle from measurements of spectrometer dark current, incoming solar irradiance and reflected radiances. Spectral measurements are made between 300 and 1150 nm wavelength at a band-to-band spacing of 3 nm, and a bandwidth (full-width, half maximum) of 10 nm. Preliminary data analysis showed that the canopy reflectance model of Kuusk [Kuusk, A. (1995). A fast, invertible canopy reflectance model. Remote Sensing of Environment 51, 342-350] reproduced the observed large differences in visible and near-infrared (NIR) reflectances, but the model was unable to predict quantitatively the observed variations in the measured reflectance spectra with azimuth, particularly in the NIR. Discrepancies between model and measurements are likely due to the inhomogeneous nature of the forest canopy in contrast to the assumption of a uniformly absorbing turbid medium in the model. Measurements using the MAS can be used to investigate directional dependences of reflectance indices and for testing BRDF models used to separate geometrical and plant physiological contributions to the reflectance signals. The MAS provides continuous sampling of reflectance indices which can be compared with canopy properties such as chlorophyll content and photosynthetic capacity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Airborne scanning LiDAR is a spatial technology increasingly used for forestry and environmental applications. However, the accuracy and coverage of LiDAR observations is highly dependent on both the extrinsic specifications of the LiDAR survey as well as the intrinsic effects such as the underlying forest structure. Extrinsic parameters which are set as part of the LiDAR survey include platform altitude, scan angle (half max. angle off nadir), and beam cross sectional diameter at the reflecting surface (referred to as footprint size). In this paper we investigate the effect of a number of these extrinsic parameters, including three different platform altitudes (1000, 2000, and 3000 in), two scan angles at 1000 in (10 degrees and 15 degrees half max. angle off nadir), and three footprint sizes (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m). The comparison was undertaken in eucalypt forests at three sites, varying in vegetation structure and topography within the Wedding Bells State Forest, Coffs Harbour, Australia. Results at the plot scale (40 x 90 m areas) indicate that tree heights computed from the 1000 in LiDAR data set (10 degrees half max. angle off nadir) are well correlated with maximum plot heights (difference < 3 m) and field measured canopy volume (r(2) > 0.75, p < 0.001). Using normalised canopy height profiles (CHP) derived for sites, from data recorded at each altitude, we observed no significant difference between the relative distribution of LiDAR returns, indicating that platform altitude and footprint size I have not had a major influence on CHP estimation. Interestingly, comparisons of first and last returns for individual pulses at increasing altitudes identified progressively fewer discrete first/last pulse combinations with more than 70% of pulses recorded as a single return at the highest altitude (3000 in). A possible hypothesis is that greater platform altitude and footprint size reduces the intensity of laser beam incident on a given surface area thus decreasing the probability of recording a last return above the noise threshold. Furthermore, tree scale analysis found a positive relationship between platform altitude and the underestimation of crown area and crown volume. The implications of this work for forest management are: (i) platform altitudes as high as 3 000 m can be used to quantify the vertical distribution of phyto-elements, (ii) higher platform altitudes record a lower proportion of first/last return combinations that will further reduce the number of points available for forest structural assessment and development of digital elevation models, and (iii) for discrete LOAR data, increasing platform altitude will record a lower frequency of returns per crown, resulting in larger underestimates of individual tree crown area and volume if standard algorithms are applied.

AB Measurements of forest structure are important for wildlife habitat management. An optimal strategy for mapping forest structure would include detailed measurements of the vertical dimension, which are traditionally provided by field sampling, together with the broad spatial coverage afforded by remote sensing. While no single sensor is capable of delivering this at the present time, it should be possible to combine information from multiple sensors to achieve a reasonable approximation. In this study, we compare estimates of forest structural metrics derived from remote sensing to measurements obtained in the field (large tree maximum canopy height, mean canopy height, standard deviation canopy height, and biomass). We then statistically combine structural information from LiDAR, RaDAR, and passive optical sensors in an attempt to improve accuracy of our estimates. The results of this study indicate that LiDAR is the best single sensor for estimating canopy height and biomass. The addition of ETM+ metrics significantly improved LiDAR estimates of large tree structure, while Quickbird and InSAR/SAR improved estimates either marginally or not at all. The combination of all sensors was more accurate than LiDAR alone, but only marginally better than the combination of LiDAR and ETM+. Structure metrics from LiDAR and RaDAR are essentially redundant, as are ETM+ and Quickbird. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Consistent NDVI time series are paramount in monitoring ecological resources that are being altered by climate and human impacts. An increasing number of natural resource managers use web-based geospatial decision support tools that integrate time series of both historical and current NDVI data derived from multiple sensors to make better informed planning and management decisions. Representative canopy reflectance and NDVI data were simulated for historical, current and future AVHRR, MODIS and VIIRS land surface monitoring satellites to quantify the differences due to sensor-specific characteristics. Cross-sensor NDVI translation equations were developed for surface conditions. The effect of a range of atmospheric conditions (Rayleigh scattering, ozone, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor content) on the sensor-specific reflectance and NDVI values were evaluated to quantify the uncertainty in the apparent NDVI for each sensor. MODIS and VIIRS NDVI data are minimally affected by the atmospheric water vapor, while AVHRR NDVI data are substantially reduced by water vapor.
   Although multi-sensor NDVI continuity can be obtained by using the developed cross-sensor translation equations, the interactions between the spectral characteristics of surface vegetation and soil components, sensor-specific spectral band characteristics and atmospheric scattering and absorption windows will introduce uncertainty due to insufficient knowledge about the atmospheric conditions that affect the signal of the Earth's pixels at the time of data acquisitions. Processing strategies and algorithm preferences among data streams are also hindering cross-sensor NDVI continuity. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Study of the detailed structure and ecological functioning of urban and peri-urban systems is intensifying due to increasing concentration of the human population into urban centers. Much of this increase is expected to occur in semiarid to and cites. Data from new high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution satellite-based sensors promise to increase our understanding of global urban ecological and climatic processes and improve city and land planning capabilities. Two of these sensors, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), provide an opportunity to compare urban spatial structure (distribution and configuration of discrete land cover/land use classes on the landscape) with contemporaneous measurements of surface biophysical composition at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Such combined measurements are useful for modeling changes to urban climate, hydrology.. and biogeochemical cycles caused by modification of the landscape. We compare gridded landscape metrics derived front expert system land cover classification of ASTER to corresponding MODIS NDVI data at scales of 250 m/pixel, 500 m/pixel, and 1 km/pixel in order to determine which of these scales is optimal for monitoring of urban biophysical processes and landscape structure change. Weak positive and negative correlations between NDVI and landscape structure were observed at all three spatial scales for the metrics Class Area, Mean Patch Size, Edge Density, and Interspersion/Juxtaposition Index.

AB The effect of large offshore wind farms on the local wind climate is studied using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Wind maps are derived from a total of 30 ERS-2 SAR scenes and 11 Envisat ASAR scenes over two large offshore wind farms in Denmark: Horns Rev in the North Sea (80 turbines) and Nysted in the Baltic Sea (78 turbines). The wind farms are the world's largest to date. For the first time, high-resolution SAR-derived wind speed images are utilized to identify regions of reduced wind speed and high turbulence intensity (i.e. wind wakes) downstream of wind turbine arrays. After quality control, 19 SAR scenes are available for the study of wake effects. A decrease of the mean wind speed is found as the wind flows through the wind farms, leaving a velocity deficit of 8-9% on average, immediately downstream of the wind turbine arrays. From this point, wind speed recovers to within 2% of the free stream velocity over a distance of 5-20 kin depending on the ambient wind speed, the atmospheric stability and the number of turbines in operation. The wake magnitude and extent found from SAR wind maps is consistent with in situ measurements and results from wake models. The standard deviation of SAR-derived wind speeds is an indicator of turbulence intensity. Added turbulence intensity downstream of a wind farm is found for 7 of the 19 cases. Turbulence intensity is not as easily identified from SAR images as changes in the mean wind speed. This may be due to a low impact of wind turbine generated turbulence on the sea surface where SAR measurements are obtained. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Water perhaps is the most valuable natural asset in the Middle East as it was a historical key for settlement and survival in Mesopotamia, "the land between two rivers". At present, the Euphrates and Tigris are the two largest trans-boundary rivers in Western Asia where Turkey, Syria, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia are the riparian countries. The Euphrates and Tigris basins are largely fed from snow precipitation whereby nearly two-thirds occur in winter and may remain in the form of snow for half of the year. The concentration of discharge mainly from snowmelt during spring and early summer months causes not only extensive flooding, inundating large areas, but also the loss of much needed water required for irrigation and power generation purposes during the summer season. Accordingly, modeling of snow-covered area in the mountainous regions of Eastern Turkey, as being one of the major headwaters of Euphrates-Tigris basin, has significant importance in order to forecast snowmelt discharge especially for energy production, flood control, irrigation and reservoir operation optimization.
   A pilot basin, located on the upper Euphrates River, is selected where five automated meteorological and snow stations are installed for real time operations. The daily snow cover maps obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS at 500 m resolution are compared with ground information for the winter of 2002 - 2003 both during accumulation and ablation and at accumulation stage for the winter of 2003-2004. The snow presence on the ground is determined from the snow courses performed. Such measurements were made at 19 points in and around the upper Euphrates River in Turkey and at 20 points in the upper portion of the pilot basin for the winters of 20022003 and 2003-2004, respectively. Comparison of MODIS snow maps with in situ measurements over the snow season show good agreement with overall accuracies ranging between 62% and 82% considering the shift in the days of comparison. The main reasons to have disagreement between MODIS and in situ data are the high cloud cover frequency in the area and the current version of the MODIS cloud-mask that appears to frequently map edges of snow-covered areas and land surfaces. The effect of elevation and land cover types on validation of MODIS snow cover maps is also analyzed. In order to minimize the cloud cover and maximize the snow cover, MODIS-8 daily snow cover products are used in deriving the snow depletion curve, which is one of the input parameters of the snowmelt runoff model (SRM). The initial results of modeling process show that MODIS snow-covered area product can be used for simulation and also for forecasting of snowmelt runoff in basins of Turkey. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Composite patterns of monthly averaged (1978-2002) satellite passive microwave derived snow water equivalent (SWE) data produced using the Meteorological Service of Canada land cover sensitive algorithm suite contain an interannually consistent and well-defined zone of high SWE retrievals (> 100 min) across the northern boreal forest of western Canada. Consistently lower SWE retrievals are present across both the comparatively dense boreal forest to the south, and open tundra to the north. Because of the sparse conventional observing network across this region, a dedicated field sampling campaign was conducted during the 2003/2004 winter season to measure snow properties across these landscape zones in northern Manitoba, Canada. Using road and helicopter access, snow cover measurements were made along an approximately 500 km transect between the communities of Thompson (boreal forest), Gillam (sparse northern boreal forest), and Churchill (open tundra) during late November 2003, and early March 2004.
   The November 2003 snow survey revealed good agreement between Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) derived SWE retrievals and in situ measurements across the gradient of increasing SWE between Thompson and Gillam, and the well defined zone of high SWE values to the north and east of Gillam. Further to the north, SSM/I derived SWE retrievals over the boreal ecotone and open tundra were consistently lower than the in situ measurements. Results of the March survey (at which point mean snow depths had increased from approximately 30-60 cm) showed an increase in absolute SWE differences between the in situ measurements and passive microwave estimates, but relative agreement between the datasets remained strong. The same SWE gradient across the boreal forest was again captured by both datasets, although tundra retrievals remained consistently low. These findings, along with consideration of snowpack stratigraphy, density, and the potential influence of tundra lakes and ponds on microwave emission and scatter, suggest that development of a tundra-specific SWE retrieval algorithm is necessary. From a scaling perspective, a large range of SWE values were measured on the ground within each satellite footprint, but a comparison of frequency histograms showed that a high percentage of satellite retrievals (November: 93%; March: 63%) fell within 20 mm of the median ground measurement.

AB Mean tree height, dominant height, mean diameter, stem number, basal area, and timber volume of 233 field sample plots were estimated from various canopy height and canopy density metrics- derived by means of a small-footprint laser scanner over young and mature forest stands- using ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression analysis, seemingly unrelated regression (SUR), and partial least-squares (PLS) regression. The sample plots were distributed systematically throughout two separate inventory areas with size 1000 and 6500 ha, respectively. The plots were divided into three predefined strata. Separate regression models were estimated for each inventory as well as common models utilizing the plots of both inventories simultaneously. In the models estimated by combining data from the two areas, the statistical effect of inventory was found to be significant (p<0.05) in the mean height models only. A total of 115 test stands and plots with size 0.3-11.7 ha were used to validate the estimated regression models. The bias and standard deviations (parenthesized) of the differences between predicted and ground reference values of mean height, dominant height, mean diameter, stem number, basal area, and volume were -5.5% to 4.7% (3.1-7.3%), -6.0% to 0.4% (2.9-8.2%), -0.2% to 7.9% (5.5-15.8%), -21.3% to 12.5% (13.4-29.3%), -7.3% to 8.4% (7.1-13.6%), and -3.9% to 10.1% (8.3-14.9%), respectively. It was revealed that only minor discrepancies occurred between the three investigated estimation techniques. None of the techniques provided predicted values that were superior to the other techniques over all combinations of strata and variables. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
