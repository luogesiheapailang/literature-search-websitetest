AB In view of multiple sensor approaches in remote sensing, we have analyzed the geometric and, in particular, radiometric accuracy of multispectral SPOT HRV (high resolution visible) data in comparison to Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images.  We used concurrent system corrected TM and SPOT images which were recorded almost simultaneously over the southern Ardeche region (France).  The TM and SPOT scenes were registered to map projection with subpixel accuracy, but the mountainous character of the study region required the use of digital elevation data for the compensation of relief induced distortions.  Our radiometric comparison of the TM and SPOT sensors involved an analysis of the calibration accuracy and a comparison of spectral greenness and brightness features which can be obtained from the two systems.  The calibration assessments were primarily based upon the apparent reflectances of bare soil reference targets, and the in-flight calibration of both sensor systems was found in accordance with the respective specifications.  For the comparative analysis of spectral features we used an extended set of targets, representing a wide range of vegetated and nonvegetated cover types.  In order to directly relate the image-based relations to those obtained from field radiometry data, we had to correct the TM and SPOT data for atmospheric absorption, scattering and pixel adjacency effects.  Both systems provide slightly different brightness and greenness information (Tasseled Cap equivalent brightness and greenness, normalized difference vegetation index).  But these indices appear to be linearly related, and the respective transfer functions permit mutual data adjustments.  Therefore, a wide range of applications in agricultural monitoring and vegetation observation can be approached by using multiple sensor data sets which involve TM and SPOT imagery.

AB A sufficient transformation technique is important in using computer-aided soil pattern recognition to interpret soils in soil surveys.  This study was conducted using the Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de le Terre (SPOT) satellite images and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data to separate five major soils in a tallgrass prairie near Manhattan, Kansas.  The high resolution SPOT satellite images were integrated with DEM data.  The soils were sampled and classified using conventional soil survey procedures.  A canonical transformation technique was used to extract the important soil features from SPOT and DEM data.  A pairwise transformed divergence analysis was also conducted to evaluate the several canonical variables in order to sufficiently separate the soils.  Consequently, two canonical variables derived from training samples were selected.  Our results suggest that canonically transformed data were superior to combined SPOT and DEM data.  High resolution SPOT images and DEM data can be used to aid second-order soil surveys in grasslands.

AB Accurate and timely monitoring of urban sprawl using remote sensing provides valuable insights for urban management and sustainable development. While existing studies have explored methods for large-scale monitoring of urban sprawl, most of them rely on the collection of manually labeled training samples for supervised classification. Additionally, previous studies generally focused on inland urban sprawl, neglecting the process of urban sprawl towards sea areas, known as seaward urban sprawl, which has profound ecological implications for coastal ecosystems. Here we develop a fully automatic algorithm for detecting urban sprawl, named Fully Automatic Detection of Urban Sprawl (FADUS), using the time-series Landsat imagery without manually collecting training samples or existing urban maps for reference. FADUS automatically generates initial samples through a sequential binary unsupervised clustering technique and then updates them by removing the spectral outliers to obtain a high-quality training set for subsequent supervised classification. A tidal module is included in FADUS to avoid pseudo-urban changes caused by tidal fluctuations so that both inland and seaward urban sprawl can be detected. By applying the algorithm to 75 coastal cities in China, the most rapidly urbanizing region in the world, we uncovered a neglected but dramatic seaward urban sprawl process that has converted sea areas to urban space since 1985. Our results indicate that 9904.36 km2 of coastal wetlands and nearshore seawater areas have been converted to land area, of which 44.83% is currently covered by built-up area. With our method, the fully automatic detection of urban dynamics is now possible for both coastal and inland cities worldwide. Our derived map of seaward urban sprawl in China provides valuable references for coastal land-cover change monitoring, wetland protection and restoration, and integrated coastal management.

AB Increasing concern over urban heat mitigation creates an emerging necessity to track the evolution of urban heat island intensity (UHII) to assess the effectiveness of existing plans in combating urban heat. However, complex human-environment interactions make it difficult to accurately isolate urban effects in UHII evolutions due to unstable non-urban references. This study provided the first test on the sensitivity of surface UHII (SUHII) trend estimate to seven methods of non-urban reference delineation across 281 Chinese cities. The corresponding seven non-urban references include administrative non-urban areas, administrative non-urban areas excluding extreme elevations, administrative low plant areas, suburb, outer suburb, outer suburbs progressively excluding unstable areas interfered by evident greening/desertification trends and the SUHI footprint of neighboring cities, respectively. Results revealed that the selection of different non-urban references significantly altered SUHII and the nature of observed surface thermal island (heat or cold) in 74% and 8% of cities, respectively. Besides, due to diverse and inconsistent land use and land cover changes across and nearby non-urban areas, the way of nonurban reference delineation also affected the amplitude and even direction of statistically significant SUHII trends in 41% and 21% of cities, respectively. Among the seven methods, the use of suburb which was collectively interfered by urban and non-urban changing factors, produced a large number of misestimated significant downtrends (2.7-4.5 times more cities than other methods) and was therefore in general not recommended. Administrative non-urban areas were not suitable to cities with evident greening/desertification trends, yet the applicability can be largely enhanced by removing areas with extreme elevations. Low plant areas were in general feasible, except for the cities with suburban low plants additionally warmed up by urban areas. Outer suburb was relatively the optimal, particularly the areas with all concerned interferences excluded. Overall, this study provided empirical evidence supporting the need to use stable non-urban references for reliable trend estimate of urban-induced SUHII variations. The results may benefit more accurate assessments of the causes, progress, and consequences of SUHI evolution, thereby minimizing the chances of policy failure in SUHI mitigation.

TI Wildfire likelihood in Canadian treed peatlands based on remote-sensing

AB While peatland fires are less common than upland fires, long periods of moisture deficit can increase fuel availability and lead to greater fire risks in peatlands. Peatland fire likelihood is crucial as these ecosystems serve as natural fire breaks under normal hydrological conditions but can easily turn into fuel sources under drought conditions. Furthermore, peatland fires have significant implications for atmospheric pollution, releasing fine particulates, carbon, and mercury emissions. Current frameworks for estimating wildfire likelihood predominantly rely on fuel-moisture indices developed for upland environments, which cannot adequately capture the hydrological and fuel-moisture conditions specific to peatlands. Additionally, common fuel-moisture indices are reliant on station-derived meteorological data, which are scarce in remote areas and therefore imprecise over large portions of sub-Arctic Canada and the boreal forest.Remote sensing data represents a proxy for near real-time surface conditions for remote locations, such as moisture and vegetation, where a time series of remotely-sensed metrics provides information about patterns and trends in local conditions over longer periods. With this in mind, we used SAR (Sentinel-1), multispectral (Sentinel-2) and human infrastructure data as a predictor of wildfire probability in treed peatlands of Canada. We developed a fire probability model based on metrics drawn from a seasonally decomposed time series of SAR backscatter and common multispectral indices of greenness, soil moisture and vegetation moisture. Sample sites were derived from an existing treed peatland map, then the Canadian Forest Service National Burned Area Composite dataset was used to identify fire events within those areas. This study presents a robust and versatile framework for training fire probability models that leverage remote sensing data and temporally-invariant ancillary predictors. Fire probability in peatland locations, given current conditions, was predicted through a model algorithm called extreme gradient boosting. To obtain fire probabilities over a four-week timeframe, the output of the binary classifier was calibrated, transforming its raw scores into more accurate probabilities.This approach showcases the effectiveness of machine learning methods in harnessing seasonally-decomposed remotely sensed time-series to improve fire prediction. The most important predictors of fire likelihood in treed peatlands were found to be multispectral moisturerelated indices (Tasseled cap Wetness and Normalized Difference Moisture Index) and the distance to human infrastructure, which may indicate an overrepresentation of human-caused fires in the predictions. Using subsets of predictors, different iterations of the model demonstrate that incorporating SAR backscatter data can enhance the accuracy of fire likelihood predictions. However, models relying solely on SAR data exhibited lower performance, indicating limited applicability of SAR backscatter in treed peatlands without more advanced filtering and a correction method.The fire likelihood model presented here adds seasonally-detrended time series metrics from remote sensing observations to inform fire risk, independent from meteorological data. Such models could be implemented for a near-real time assessment of fire conditions that could complement the existing framework for fire risk predictions in Canada.

TI Grassland cut detection based on Sentinel-2 time series to respond to
   the environmental and technical challenges of the Austrian fodder
   production for livestock feeding
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE Grassland cut detection; Copernicus Sentinel-2; Time series analysis
AB The relationship between yield and quality of grassland fodder is an important factor for livestock farmers to consider when deciding the timing of grassland cuts. Even for experienced farmers, estimating this relationship is difficult because external factors such as weather can affect the growth rate of plants. Satellite remote sensing techniques have good potential for the modelling of fodder biomass and quality. However, more accurate grassland cut dates are needed. Unfortunately, current cut detection methods vary in both form, function and accuracy and a common framework for cut detection does not yet exist, especially for in-season cut estimation. The aim of this study is to develop an improved methodology for Austrian fodder production systems that can be used for both post-season and in-season cut detection. In the first case, cuts are detected at the end of the vegetation period and used for post-season assessment at national and regional levels. In the second case, cuts are detected in near-real-time during the season, and they can be used to model yield and quality. The approach is tested across the Austrian landscape on mown grasslands using freely available Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery on the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The method uses a fitted NDVI curve obtained by iteratively smoothing the upper envelope of the actual observations using the Whittaker smoother. Cuts are detected by meeting a threshold in the difference between the fitted NDVI curve and the actual observed NDVI values. Additional innovative steps were developed to reduce the impact of cloud cover on the results for timely and accurate cut detection, including a gradient boosting algorithm to detect false positive cuts due to missed clouds. A set of rules for the method was trained on 97 plots and validated on a further 502 plots over three years (2020, 2021 and 2022). The method performed well in plots with two to four cuts per season, but occasionally struggled in more intensively managed systems, most likely due to a rule preventing two cuts within 27 days. A pooled post-season cut date detection f-score of 0.79 suggests that the method can accurately detect cuts, with absolute detection errors of <5 days. The main misclassifications were the results of (thin and semi-transparent) clouds being erroneously detected as cuts. With an f-score of 0.80 and total absolute delayed detection of approximately 6 days, the inseason cut date detection performs similarly to the post-season configuration. This indicates a high potential for near-real-time applications. Our results moreover indicate a general improvement of existing methodologies despite performing the cut detection across the fragmented, mountainous and diverse Austrian landscape. Future work will include grazed pastures and natural grassland with less intensive human activity.

ID PATTERNS; DENSITY
AB Reef halos are rings of bare sand that surround coral reef patches. Halo formation is likely to be the indirectly result of interactions between relatively healthy predator and herbivore populations. To reduce the risk of predation, herbivores preferentially graze close to the safety of the reef, potentially affecting the presence and size of the halo. Reef halos are readily visible in remotely sensed imagery, and monitoring their presence and changes in size may therefore offer clues as to how predator and herbivore populations are faring. However, manually identifying and measuring halos is slow and limits the spatial and temporal scope of studies. There are currently no existing tools to automatically identify single reef halos and measure their size to speed up their identification and improve our ability to quantify their variability over space and time. Here we present a set of convolutional neural networks aimed at identifying and measuring reef halos from very high-resolution satellite imagery (i.e., similar to 0.6 m spatial resolution). We show that deep learning algorithms can successfully detect and measure reef halos with a high degree of accuracy (F1 = 0.824), thereby enabling faster, more accurate spatio-temporal monitoring of halo size. This tool will aid in the global study of reef halos, and potentially coral reef ecosystem monitoring, by facilitating our discovery of the ecological dynamics underlying reef halo presence and variability.

AB Wind speeds have substantially changed over the Northern Hemisphere during the past a few decades, and such changes have been shown to have important implications for the growth, chemical composition, structure, and morphology of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effects of wind change on the spring leaf green-up date (GUD) remain largely unknown. Using both 89 sites of flux measurements (972 site-year in total) and satellite observations over 1982-2015, here we show that higher winds in the spring preseason contributed to the delayed GUD for 29.8% of northern ecosystems, and various factors controlled the strength of the delaying effects. We further show that the earlier GUD with climate change was offset roughly by 24.4 & PLUSMN; 3.7% due to the increase of wind. Higher winds potentially caused delayed GUD by changes in soil conditions and differences between daytime and night-time temperatures. A higher precipitation could likely compensate the drying effects of winds on GUD. Among different vegetation types, soil water and water use efficiency were the most important regu-lators of the sensitivity of GUD to wind for all plant functional types, while evapotranspiration regulated grasslands and shrubs. Our results identified the new role of wind change on the spring phenology in respective of satellite observations, and future ecosystem models might consider these effects for a better representation of the responses of vegetation phenology to climate change.

AB Fine-resolution land surface temperature (LST) derived from thermal infrared remote sensing images is a good indicator of surface water status and plays an essential role in the exchange of energy and water between land and atmosphere. A physical surface energy balance (SEB)-based LST downscaling method (DTsEB) is developed to downscale coarse remotely sensed thermal infrared LST products with fine-resolution visible and near-infrared data. The DTsEB method is advantageous for its ability to mechanically interrelate surface variables contributing to the spatial variation of LST, to quantitatively weigh the contributions of each related variable within a physical framework, and to efficaciously avoid the subjective selection of scaling factors and the establishment of statistical regression relationships. The applicability of the DTsEB method was tested by downscaling 12 scenes of 990 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and aggregated Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) LST products to 90 m resolution at six overpass times between 2005 and 2015 over three 9.9 km by 9.9 km cropland (mixed by grass, tree, and built-up land) study areas. Three typical LST downscaling methods, namely the widely applied TsHARP, the later developed least median square regression downscaling (LMS) and the geographically weighted regression (GWR), were introduced for inter comparison. The results showed that the DTsEB method could more effectively reconstruct the subpixel spatial variations in LST within the coarse-resolution pixels and achieve a better downscaling accuracy than the TsHARP, LMS and GWR methods. The DTsEB method yielded, on average, root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.01 K and 1.42 K when applied to the MODIS datasets and aggregated ASTER datasets, respectively, which were lower than those obtained with the TsHARP method, with average RMSEs of 2.41 K and 1.71 K, the LMS method, with average RMSEs of 2.35 K and 1.63 K, and the GWR method, with average RMSEs of 2.38 K and 1.64 K, respectively. The contributions of the related surface variables to the subpixel spatial variation in the LST varied both spatially and temporally and were different from each other. In summary, the DTsEB method was demonstrated to outperform the TsHARP, LMS, and GWR methods and could be used as a good alternative for downscaling LST products from coarse to fine resolution with high robustness and accuracy.

AB Observations of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) by remote sensing have improved our understanding of the structural and physiological dynamics of vegetation. Substantial efforts have been made to measure SIF with ground-based sensing systems, but field observation data for various plant functional types are still sparse. This is partly due to the limited availability of commercial SIF measurement systems, the relatively high cost of hyperspectral spectroradiometers, and the difficulties of sensor calibration and maintenance in the field. We developed a filter-based smart near-surface remote sensing system for SIF (4S-SIF) to overcome the technical challenges of monitoring SIF in the field, which also decreased the sensor cost, thus enabling more compre-hensive spatial sampling. To retrieve SIF, we combined ultra-narrow bandpass filters (full width half maximum <1.3 nm) and photodiode detectors to observe electromagnetic radiation at specific wavelengths (757, 761, and 770 nm). We confirmed that the spectral and radiometric performance of the bandpass filters was satisfactory to retrieve SIF by comparing them to a high-spectral-resolution spectroradiometer that served as a reference. In particular, we confirmed that the digital numbers (DNs) from 4S-SIF exhibited linear relationships with the DN from the reference spectroradiometer in each band (R2 > 0.99). In addition, we developed equations to correct for temperature-induced changes in filter transmittance, such that SIF can be reliably extracted in outdoor en-vironments without the need to actively stabilize the temperature. Furthermore, we confirmed that the SIF signal from 4S-SIF had a strong linear relationship with the reference spectroradiometer-based SIF. Importantly, this relationship held even when the physiological mechanisms of the plant were altered by a herbicide treatment that induced substantial changes in the SIF signal (R2 = 0.85, relative RMSE = 0.22), which indicated that 4S-SIF could be used to retrieve SIF. We believe that 4S-SIF will be a useful tool for collecting in-situ SIF data across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

AB Satellite remote sensing of chlorophyll-a concentration (chla) in oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes faces un-certainties from sources such as atmospheric correction, complex inherent optical property compositions, and imperfect algorithmic retrieval. To improve chla estimation in oligo-and mesotrophic lakes, we developed Bayesian probabilistic neural networks (BNNs) for the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Cover Instrument (OLCI) and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI). The BNNs were built using an in situ dataset of oligo-and mesotrophic water bodies (1755 observations from 178 systems; median chla: 5.11 mg m- 3, standard deviation: 10.76 mg m-3) and provide a per-pixel uncertainty percentage associated with retrieved chla. Shifts of oligo-and meso-trophic systems into the eutrophic regime, characterised by higher biomass levels, are widespread. To account for phytoplankton biomass fluctuation, a set of eutrophic lakes (167 observations from 31 systems) were included in this study (maximum chla 68 mg m-3). The BNNs were evaluated through five assessments including single day and time series match-ups with OLCI and MSI. OLCI BNN accuracy gains of >25% and MSI BNN accuracy gains of >15% were achieved in the assessments when compared to chla reference algorithms for oligotrophic waters (chla <= 8 mg m-3). In comparison to the reference algorithms, the accuracy gains of the BNNs decreased as chla and trophic levels increased. To measure the quality of the provided BNN uncertainty estimate, we calculated the prediction interval coverage probability (PICP), Sharpness and mean absolute calibration difference (MACD) metrics. The associated BNN chla uncertainty estimate included the reference in situ chla values for most ob-servations (PICP >= 75%) across the different performance assessments. Further analysis showed that the BNN chla uncertainty estimate was not constantly well-calibrated across different evaluation strategies (Sharpness 1.7-6, MACD 0.04-0.25). BNN uncertainties were used to test two chla improvement strategies: 1) identifying and filtering uncertain chla estimates using scene-specific thresholds, and 2) selecting the most accurate prior atmospheric correction algorithm per individual satellite observation to retain chla with the lowest BNN un-certainty. Both strategies increased the quality of the chla result and demonstrated the significance of uncertainty estimation. This study serves as research on Bayesian machine learning for the estimation and visualisation of chla and associated retrieval uncertainty to develop harmonised products across OLCI and MSI for small and large oligo-and mesotrophic lakes.

AB Knowledge of tree species is required to inform management, planning, and monitoring of forests as well as to characterize habitat and ecosystem function. Remotely sensed data and spatial modeling enable mapping of tree species presence and distribution. Following an assessment of tree species identified in the sample-based National Forest Inventory (NFI), we mapped 37 tree species over the 650-Mha, forest-dominated ecosystems of Canada representing 2019 conditions. Landsat imagery and related spectral indices, geographic and climate data, elevation derivatives, and remote sensing-derived phenology are used as predictor variables trained with cali-bration samples from Canada's NFI using the Random Forests machine learning algorithm. Based upon prior knowledge of tree species distributions, classification models were implemented on a regional basis, meaning only the tree species that are expected in a given mapping region were modeled using local calibration samples. Modeling resulted in class membership probabilities values for each regionally eligible tree species for all treed pixels as well as an indicator of attribution confidence derived from the distance in feature space between the two leading classes. Accuracy assessment was conducted using independent validation data also drawn from the NFI following the same selection rules and indicated an overall accuracy of 93.1% +/- 0.1% (95%-confidence interval). Predictor variables informing on geographic, climatic and topographic conditions had the largest importance on the classification models. Nationally, the most common leading tree species were black spruce (Picea mariana; 203 Mha or 57.3% of the treed area), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides; 34.7 Mha, 9.8%), and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta; 21.1 Mha, 5.9%). Regionally, there was ecozone-level dominance of other tree species, including subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa; Montane Cordillera), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla; Pacific Maritime), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea; Atlantic Maritime). Based upon the per-pixel class membership probabilities, species assemblages akin to those in forest inventories can also be produced. Further, given the calibrated reflectance of Landsat imagery, the methods presented herein can be implemented over a time series of images. The approach uses open data as predictor variables, making the method portable to other areas given availability of tree species training data.

AB Glaciers in many parts of the world are reported to be undergoing a darkening process (decrease in surface albedo). This has multiple causes, including the presence of impurities (such as mineral dust, carbonaceous particles, algae and cryoconite), and debris. Also glacier melt can induce an albedo decrease by initiating a melt-albedo feedback cycle. The extent of this albedo decrease and its spatial variability in different mountain ranges however are poorly known. In this study, we assess albedo changes on a selection of Alpine glaciers (542 glaciers > 0.1 km(2)) by deriving eight albedo metrics from MODIS MOD10A1 satellite observations over a time period of 20 years (2000-2019). Albedo metrics include the start and end of the ablation season and its length, calculated through the selection of a threshold (albedo = 0.4) to separate melting ice from snow. We further calculated the number of ice melt days, integral of the length of the ablation season, minimum annual albedo, mean summer albedo and mean annual albedo. We identified significant trends in all metrics for a large percentage of glacier cells. A negative trend in minimum albedo (-0.06 decade(-1) on average) was identified for 56% of glacier cells, and 70% of glaciers; a positive trend in the length of season (+18 days decade(-1) on average) was identified for 11% of glacier cells and 19% of glaciers. Changes in minimum albedo occur mostly around the glacier median elevation, while for other metrics (e.g. start and length of season) changes are more frequent at the glacier termini (i.e. below 25th elevation percentile). We further investigated the relationship between the metrics and climate (downscaled ERA5 reanalysis data) and topographic (ALOS AW3D30 DEM) variability; we found that average summer temperature and elevation are the most significant proxies for all metrics (maximum correlation = 0.40 between elevation and minimum albedo) compared to spring temperature and other topographic variables. Finally, we looked at the ability of the albedo metrics to represent annual and summertime glacier mass balance of 31 selected Alpine glaciers in the World Glacier Monitoring Service database, finding significant correlations between minimum and summertime albedo and annual mass balance (R-2 = 0.44 for minimum albedo and 0.40 for summertime albedo using all observations). Considering individual glaciers, all showed significant correlations with minimum albedo, and some of them are strongly correlated (e.g. Argentiere: R-2 = 0.84, Saint Sorlin R-2 = 0.88). Our glacier phenology approach opens new perspectives for the remote sensing of alpine and polar glaciers.

AB Remote sensing can be used to collect information related to forest management. Previous studies demonstrated the potential of using multispectral satellite imagery for classifying tree species. However, methods that can map tree species in mixed forest stands on a large scale are lacking. We propose an innovative method for mapping the proportions of tree species using Sentinel-2 imagery. A convolutional neural network was used to quantify the per-pixel basal area proportions of tree species considering the neighbouring environment (spectral-spatial deep learning). A nested U-shaped neural network (UNet++) architecture was implemented. We produced a map of the entire Wallonia Region (southern Belgium). Nine species or groups of species were considered: Spruce genus, Oak genus, Beech, Douglas fir, Pine genus, Poplar genus, Larch genus, Birch genus, and remaining species. The training dataset for the convolutional neural network model was prepared using a map of forest parcels extracted from the public forest administration's geodatabase of Wallonia. The accuracy of the predicted map covering the region was independently assessed using data from the regional forest inventory of Wallonia. A robust assessment method for tree species proportions maps was proposed for assessing the (1) majority species, (2) species composition (presence or absence), and (3) species proportions (proportion values). The achieved value of indicator OA(maj )(0.73) shows that our approach can map the majority tree species in mixed and pure forest stands. Indicators MS (0.89), MPS (0.72) and MUS (0.83) support that the model can predict the species composition in most cases in the study area. Spruce genus, Oak genus, Beech, and Douglas fir achieved the best results, with PAs and UAs close to or higher than 0.70. Particularly, high performance was achieved for detecting Oak genus and Beech in low area proportions: PAs and UAs higher than 0.70 from the 0.4 proportion. Predicted proportions had a R-adj (2)of 0.50. The proposed method, which uses spectral-spatial deep learning to map the proportions of tree species, is innovative because it was adapted to the complexity of mixed forests and spatial resolution of current satellite imagery. Additionally, it optimises the use of available forest data in the model conception by considering all pixels from pure stands to highly mixed forest stands. When forest inventories are available in a broad sense, that is, georeferenced areas with the proportions of tree species, this method is highly reproducible and applicable at a large scale, offering potential for use in forest management.

AB The estimation of biophysical variables is at the core of remote sensing science, allowing a close monitoring of crops and forests. Deriving temporally resolved and spatially explicit maps of parameters of interest has been the subject of intense research. However, deriving products from optical sensors is typically hampered by cloud contamination and the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In this work we rely on the HIghly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HISTARFM) algorithm to generate long gap-free time series of Landsat surface reflectance data by fusing MODIS and Landsat reflectances. An artificial neural network is trained on PROSAIL inversion to predict monthly biophysical variables at 30 m spatial resolution with asso-ciated, realistic uncertainty bars. We emphasize the need for a more thorough analysis of uncertainty, and propose a general and scalable approach to combine both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties by exploiting Monte Carlo (MC) dropout techniques from the trained artificial network and the propagation of HISTARFM uncertainties through the model, respectively. A model recalibration was performed in order to provide reliable uncertainties. We provide new high resolution products of several key variables to quantify the terrestrial biosphere: Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), Canopy Water Content (CWC) and Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) are at 30 m Landsat spatial resolution and over large continental areas. Two study areas are considered: the large heterogeneous but moderately cloud covered contiguous United States, and the homogeneous but largely cloud covered Amazonia. The produced vegetation products largely agree with the test dataset (R = 0.90, RMSE = 0.80 m2/m2 and ME = 0.12 m2/m2 for LAI, and R = 0.98, RMSE = 0.07 and ME = 0.01 for FAPAR) providing low error and high accuracy. Additionally, the validation considers a thorough comparison with operational and largely validated medium resolution products, such as the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Copernicus Global Land Service. Our products presented a good agreement and consistency with both MODIS (R = 0.84 and R = 0.85 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively) and Copernicus (R = 0.92 and R = 0.91 for LAI and FAPAR, respectively).

AB Many studies have established the strong connections between aboveground biomass and lidar height metrics; however, these relationships are site-specific. Field data required to derive these relationships are not readily available in many cases. We developed a model to estimate plot-level aboveground biomass density (AGBD) directly from large-footprint lidar waveform measurements. An individual tree-based aboveground biomass (AGB)-height allometric relationship was scaled up to the plot level using lidar-waveform sensed tree height and crown size distribution characteristics. The AGBD was estimated based on a waveform/foliage profile-weighted height-based allometric equation. The AGBD-height scaling exponent was then built on the allometric relationships of tree height with stem diameter and crown volume with tree height. Global vegetation structure data analysis demonstrated that one general model (scaling exponent similar to 1.6-1.8) works reasonably well across all global forest biomes except boreal forests (scaling exponent similar to 0.9). We applied the model to estimate above-ground biomass in two distinct geographic regions: temperate deciduous/conifer forests in the northeastern USA and a montane conifer forest in Sierra National Forest in California. Local vegetation structural data analysis leads to a consistent height scaling exponent for these two distinct biomes, slightly different from the global data analysis results. This model produced optimal AGBD estimates using the local height scaling exponent value. Adequate AGBD estimates with the general height scaling exponent value were also provided by our model. Our analysis suggests one general allometric relationship between plot-level AGBD and large-footprint lidar wave-forms. Integrating local structure allometric relationships improve the predictive accuracy of the model. Our model outperformed the lidar height metrics-based approach for AGBD estimates and overcame the biomass underestimation problem using height metrics for high biomass regions. This model could potentially serve as a general and robust model for monitoring forest carbon stocks using large-footprint lidar waveform measurements such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission at the continental and global scales. The model could be a framework for integrating a demography-based terrestrial ecosystem model and GEDI global mission measurements to improve global carbon stock and flux estimates.

AB The relationship between biodiversity and spectral diversity is highly scale-dependent, and temporal variation in leaf morphological, biochemical traits and canopy structure can alter this relationship. However, the temporal dependence of the spectral diversity - biodiversity relationship is poorly understood, in part due to the diffi-culties of obtaining consistent measurements across space and time. Using leaf pigments and leaf and canopy reflectance throughout a growing season in the Cedar Creek prairie biodiversity experiment, we explored phenological effects on the scale dependence of the spectral biodiversity - biodiversity relationship. Leaf reflectance spectra displayed larger among-species variation than leaf pigments, indicating that leaf reflectance contained more information for distinguishing species than some leaf trait measurements. At the canopy scale, spectral variation derived using reflectance was mainly driven by among-species variation. The canopy scale spectral diversity was also influenced by changing vegetation percent cover, key phenological events (e.g., flowering), and disturbance (drought). Our results revealed that contrasting phenological patterns of spectral diversity metrics emerged at leaf and canopy scales. Because a misunderstanding of these contrasting temporal effects across spatial scales can lead to possible misinterpretations of the spectral diversity - biodiversity rela-tionship or of their underlying causes, more research effort is needed to understand these cross-scale temporal effects.

AB This study describes the development of a new, near real-time (NRT) global operational snow analysis, called the US Air Force Snow and Ice Analysis (USAF-SI). USAF-SI is a timely replacement for USAF 557th Weather Wing (557 WW)'s Snow Depth Analysis Model (SNODEP), which provides a six-hourly global analysis of snow at 25km resolution and is used by numerous other 557 WW programs and external customers. USAF-SI incorporates several major enhancements over SNODEP. USAF-SI employs additional ancillary datasets and updates the algorithms related to passive microwave-based snow depth (SD) retrieval, surface observation blending, and quality control. The spatial resolution of USAF-SI estimates is also enhanced from 25-km to 10-km. The quality of USAF-SI is evaluated by comparing it against independent in-situ measurements at ~2300 sites. USAF-SI demonstrates improved performance over SNODEP, particularly during the peak snow accumulation and spring snow melt periods. In addition, USAF-SI is compared with routinely available SD analysis such as Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5-Land, and Canadian Meteorological Center. Overall, the NRT USAF-SI provides comparable skills to these high-latency products, while outperforming them in some of the regional evaluations.

AB Urban land-cover information is essential for resource allocation and sustainable urban development. Recently, deep learning algorithms have shown promising results in land-cover mapping with high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery. However, the limitation of the annotation and the divergence of the multi-sensor images always challenge the transferability of deep learning, thus hindering city-level or national-level mapping. In this paper, we propose a scheme to leverage small-scale airborne images with labels (source) for unlabeled large-scale spaceborne image (target) classification. Considering the sensor characteristics, a Cross-Sensor Land-cOVEr framework, called LoveCS, is introduced to address the difficulties of the spatial resolution inconsistency and spectral differences. As for the structural design, cross-sensor normalization is proposed to automatically learn sensor-specific normalization weights, thereby narrowing the spectral differences hierarchically. Furthermore, a dense multi-scale decoder is proposed to effectively fuse the multi-scale features from different sensors. As for the model optimization, self-training domain adaptation is adopted, and multi-scale pseudo-labeling is proposed to reduce the scale divergence brought by the spatial resolution inconsistency. The effectiveness of LoveCS was tested on data from the three cities of Nanjing, Changzhou, and Wuhan in China. The comprehensive results all show that LoveCS is superior to the existing domain adaptation methods in cross-sensor tasks, and has good generalizability. Compared with the existing land-cover products, the obtained results have the highest accuracy and spatial resolution (1.0 m). Overall, LoveCS provides a new perspective for large-scale land-cover mapping based on limited HSR images.

AB Eutrophication of the eastern plain lake (EPL) region has a significant impact on the sustainable economic development and is closely related to the shortage of water resources in China. Remote sensing provides an effective tool for quantifying the trophic state of inland waters by associating the trophic state index (TSI) with optically active water quality parameters. However, limited by the satellite coverage range and operation time, the long-term changes in the trophic state of the EPL region have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to fill this gap by generating a 35-year (1986-2020) TSI dataset of lakes in the eastern plain based on Landsat images. The TSI inversion algorithm based on the algal biomass index (ABI) was designed for Landsat series after consistency analysis. The seasonal variations of the TSI showed the highest TSI (62.0 +/- 11.4) in summer and the lowest TSI (51.6 +/- 8.0) in winter, with uncertainties caused by the limitation of ABI for extremely turbid waters and the number of Landsat seasonal images. The TSI of the EPLs increased over the past 35 years by about 8.2%. Four change patterns were defined for the long-term interannual TSI variations: increasing trend less than 50% (Mode 1) or more than 50% (Mode 2), breaking points that show a surge trend (Mode 3), and decreasing trend (Mode 4). The contribution of meteorological and anthropogenic factors was calculated using a generalized linear model, which revealed that the eutrophication of inland lakes in the EPL region is mainly affected by industrial wastewater discharge and urban expansion. The influence of these explanatory variables becomes more complex with an increase in lake area. Our research provides an estimation of the TSI for the first 35-year basin-scale in the EPL region and a comprehensive evaluation of the driving factors of inland water eutrophication. The results can be used for the effective management and restoration of lakes.

TI Information fusion for GNSS-R wind speed retrieval using statistically

   wind retrieval; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Information fusion;
   Cumulative distribution function (CDF); matching
AB Spaceborne global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) has recently been applied for wind speed retrieval over oceans, where the wind speed is often retrieved using features extracted from delay-Doppler map (DDM) and empirical geophysical model functions (GMFs). However, it is challenging to utilize the other factors related to the GNSS-R process, such as the geometry and sea state, as the input in GMF given their complicated effects. The use of a fully connected network (FCN) has been recently proposed, but the overfitting occurs at high wind speed due to the non-uniform wind distribution, and some information is undesirably forfeited due to artificially extracting features from DDMs. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based end-to-end modified convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which applies the cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching. A multimodal approach is utilized where the convolutional layers extract effective DDM features at first. Then, they are fused with the auxiliary information, including the geolocation of the specular point, incidence angle, range corrected gain (RCG), uncertainty of bistatic radar cross section (BRCS), and significant wave height (SWH). Further, multiple fully connected layers compose the remainder of the network's layers. At the last step, CDF matching is applied to correct the system deviation of CNN winds. We found that the root mean square error (RMSE) and bias of wind speed retrievals are 1.53 m/s and - 0.097 m/s, respectively, within 0-25 m/s when the proposed method is used. Notably, the bias is reduced by 51%, compared with the FCN architecture, while the RMSE of the retrievals at 12-25 m/s is improved by 12%. Moreover, the RMSE and bias against the incidence angle differ no more than 0.35 m/s and 0.078 m/s, while those against RCG differ less than 0.24 m/s and 0.061 m/s, respectively. Time-series analyses indicated that the wind speed retrievals of the proposed model are in line with the referenced wind speeds. We identified a temporal increase of the retrieval bias, driven by the downward trend of DDM observation in the cyclone global navigation satellite system (CYGNSS) Version 2.1 inadequately calibrated products.

AB A full understanding of the Asian dust cycle can help with evaluation of the profound impact of mineral dust on human health, the ecosystem, the terrestrial and oceanic biogeochemical cycles, and the weather and climate. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP)-based 3-D dust detection and routine sampling capability, with the accurate dust mass extinction efficiency from Dust Constraints from joint Observational Modelling-experimental analysis (DustCOMM) dataset, has made it possible to estimate the climatology of Asian dust mass loading (DML) and its transport flux. This study draws on this to provide new insights into the Asian dust cycle, especially the variability of its mass-weighted dust transport central axis (TCA), the contribution of different desert sources to its downstream effects, and the resulting dust budgets in terrestrial and oceanic regions. Dust aerosols emitted from the East Asian and Central Asian deserts together form a heavy dust transport belt stretching from the Taklimakan Desert (TD) and Gobi Desert (GD) to the Pacific Ocean. South Asian dust from the Thar Desert (ThD) can also affect southern China by crossing the Hengduan Mountains and the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The dust TCA is controlled by the terrain of northwest inland China, but shifts in remote regions in the range of 35-50 degrees N due to the western Pacific subtropical high and Aleutian low, and it trend towards a zonal straight line as the altitude increases. The dust transport contribution of the East Asian deserts to the mainland of China and adjacent sea is about 7 times than that of South Asia, with the annual transport fluxes being 214.28 and 30.43 Tg, respectively. The GD dominates the contribution of Asian deserts to the downstream effects and accounts for about 60% of the dust. This can be attributed to its maximum transport flux being near the surface, while the dust transport of the TD and ThD is above 3 km because of the blocking effect of the surrounding terrain. The deposition of Asian dust in the adjacent seas decreases significantly along the dust TCA, with the annual deposition rates being about 40.12, 20.41, and 4.01 g m(-2) in the Yellow Sea, Japan Sea and the Northwest Pacific Ocean, respectively. These new findings and quantification of the Asian dust cycle will help with validation of the simulations provided by global and regional climate models and enable further evaluation of the impact of Asian dust on various related Earth systems.

AB Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) represents the planar fraction of the land-surface covered by green foliage, and its dynamics are important for an enhanced understanding of ecosystems especially how they respond to climate change. The lack of global near-real-time satellite-based products restricts the application of FVC in ecosystem modeling, climate change, and vegetation phenology studies. Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) spacecraft provides daily spectral reflectance of the entire sunlit Earth in the near Hotspot directions. Hotspot observations (i.e., observation in Hotspot direction which has the peak backscattering reflected radiation) with only sunlit vegetation and sunlit soil components are more suitable for FVC estimation with a two-endmember mixture model as such observations exclude contributions from shaded vegetation and soil components. In this study, an algorithm for retrieving quasi-daily FVC from EPIC based on two-endmember mixture and gap fraction models is developed. Analyses of its performance predict that the average Root-Mean-Square Deviations (RMSDs) of retrievals in FVC units is below 0.050 when compared with reference values. The RMSD is 0.043 when compared to field-based Landsat reference FVC, which confirms lower retrieval uncertainty than FVC retrieved from Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite products such as MODIS, VIIRS, and GEOV2 with RMSDs 0.049- 0.087. The comparison analyses suggest a good consistency between EPIC FVC and FVC products from LEO and geostationary (GEO) satellites sensor, SEVIRI, with RMSD values less than 0.129. EPIC allows for quasi-daily FVC estimation across the global terrestrial surface at 10 km resolution, which is an important development for numerous biophysical applications.

AB The top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo, a key component of the earth's energy balance, can be monitored regularly by satellite observations. Compared to the previous study Song et al. (2018), this paper estimates TOA albedo by directly linking Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) narrowband reflectance with TOA broadband albedo determined by NASA's Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instead of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The TOA albedo product developed in this study has an increased spatial resolution, from 1 degrees to 0.05 degrees, and its starting year has been extended from 2000 to 1981, compared to the CERES TOA albedo product. Models of lands and oceans are established separately under different atmospheric and surface conditions using gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) method instead of the linear regression models in the previous study. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the cloudy-sky, clear sky and snow-cover models over land are 11.2%, 9.2% and 2.3%, respectively; over oceans they are 14.6%, 10.6% and 5.6%, respectively. Compared to Song et al. (2018), the improvements of the three models over land are 28.8%, 29.2% and 68.6%, respectively. Compared to the CERES product, the new product is much more accurate than that from our previous study. The global monthly mean differences of the TOA albedo obtained with the GBRT product and CERES from 2001 to 2014 are mostly less than 5%.

AB Remote sensing imagery (RSI) and point of interest (POI) are two complementary data for urban functional zone (UFZ) extraction. However, current methods only use single data or just simply fuse the features extracted from these two data, which may not fully exploit their complementary strength. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a unified deep learning framework containing two modules to jointly use RSI and POIs for UFZ extraction. In the first module, the complementary feature learning and fusing module, two coupled convolu-tional neural networks (CNNs) are used to learn the visual feature from RSI and social feature from POIs, respectively. Specifically, to apply CNN on discrete POIs, we convert them into a hierarchical distance heatmap, and employ CNN with the attention mechanism to extract the co-occurrence relationship of POIs in a specific UFZ for social feature representation. Afterward, we ensemble these two coupled CNNs by a feature attention based fusion strategy, to fuse the complementary features learned from RSI and POIs with adaptively learned weights in an end-to-end manner. In the second module, the UFZ spatial relationship modeling module, different from previous methods that only consider features in single UFZ, we design a spatial relation learning network, which can aggregate both local and long-range between-UFZ spatial relationship for UFZ classification. Experiments on three urban regions demonstrate that the proposed framework can take full advantage of visual, social, and spatial features learned from both RSI and POIs, and thus achieve more satisfactory result than the methods using single data or simple fusion strategy. Furthermore, we analyze the impacts of several factors on UFZ extraction, including the contributions of different category of POIs on UFZ extraction improvement, the synergy mechanism of RSI and POIs for the classification of UFZs, and the influence of using different mapping unit for UFZ mapping. The insights distilled from this study can potentially help researchers use heterogeneous data for UFZ extraction.

AB According to the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH), spectral variance has the potential to predict taxonomic composition in grasslands over time. However, in previous studies the relationship has been found to be unstable. We hypothesise that the diversity of phenological stages is also a driver of spectral variance and could act to confound the species signal. To test this concept, intra-annual repeat spectral and botanical sampling was performed at the quadrat scale at two grassland sites, one displaying high species diversity and the other low species diversity. Six botanical metrics were used, three taxonomy based and three phenology based. Using uni-temporal linear permutation models, we found that the SVH only held at the high diversity site and only for certain metrics and at particular time points. We also tested the seasonal influence of phenological stage dominance, alongside the taxonomic and phenological diversity metrics on spectral variance using linear mixed models. A term of percentage mature leaves, alongside an interaction term of percentage mature leaves and species diversity, explained 15-25% of the model variances, depending on the spectral region used. These results indicate that the dominant canopy phenology stage is a confounding variable when examining the spectral variance-species diversity relationship. We emphasise the challenges that exist in tracking species or phenology-based metrics in grasslands using spectral variance but encourage further research that contextualises spectral variance data within seasonal plant development alongside other canopy structural and leaf traits.

AB In this study, we compared a two-phase laser-scanning-based forest inventory of stands versus a traditional field inventory using sample plots. The two approaches were used to estimate stem volume (VOL), Lorey's mean height (HL), Lorey's stem diameter (DL), and VOL per tree species in a study area in Sweden. The estimates were compared at the stand level with the harvested reference values obtained using a forest harvester. In the first phase, a helicopter acquired airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with >500 points/m2 along 50-m wide strips across the stands. These strips intersected systematic plots in phase two, where terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was used to model DL for individual trees. In total, phase two included 99 plots across 10 boreal forest stands in Sweden (lat 62.9 degrees N, long 16.9 degrees E). The single trees were segmented in both the ALS and TLS data and linked to each other. The very-high-resolution ALS data enabled us to directly measure tree heights and also classify tree species using a convolutional neural network. Stem volume was predicted from the predicted DBH and the estimated height, using national models, and aggregated at the stand level. The study demonstrates a workflow to derive forest variables and stand-level statistics that has potential to replace many manual field inventories thanks to its time efficiency and improved accuracy. To evaluate the inventories, we estimated bias, RMSE, and precision, expressed as standard error. The laser-scanning-based inventory provided estimates with an accuracy considerably higher than the field inventory. The RMSE was 17 m3/ha (7.24%), 0.9 m (5.63%), and 16 mm (5.99%) for VOL, HL, and DL respectively. The tree species classification was generally successful and improved the three species-specific VOL estimates by 9% to 74%, compared to field estimates. In conclusion, the demonstrated laser-scanning-based inventory shows potential to replace some future forest inventories, thanks to the increased accuracy demonstrated empirically in the Swedish forest study area.

AB Over the past decade, western North America glaciers experienced strong mass loss. Regional mass loss during the ablation season is influenced by air temperature, but the importance of other factors such as changes in surface albedo remains uncertain. We examine changes in surface albedo for 17 glaciated regions of western North America as documented in a 20-year record (2000 to 2019) of MODIS daily snow albedo (MOD10A1). Trend analysis reveals that albedo declined for 4% to 81% of the albedo grid cells, and the largest negative trends were situated south of 60 degrees N and in the provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. Sen's slope estimates indicate that 15 of 17 regions showed a decline of which the majority of the largest declines occurred within 100 m of glacier median elevation, suggesting that these declines are driven by a rise of the transient snowline. For most regions, albedo correlates strongly to temperature, and albedo trend in the Chugach region of Alaska, the South Coast, Southern Interior and Central and Southern Rockies of Canada show a significant relationship to aerosols optical depth. Temperature is approximately 2-6 times more predictive of the variation in albedo than AOD for the majority of regions, except the Southern Interior and Southern Rockies where albedo shows a greater dependence on AOD. Investigation of broadband albedo (MCD43A3) for snow grid cells above glacier median elevation in the Central and Southern Rockies shows that declines in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum are linked to the presence of forest fire generated aerosols. The results of this study indicate that glacier surface mass balance experiences a regional dependence on forest fire generated light absorbing particles.

AB The fine spatial resolution of the ICESat-2 (IS2) satellite altimeter allows monitoring the evolution of sea ice thickness with detailed dynamic information (e.g. ridges and leads). In this study, we first assess the ability of IS2 to estimate thermodynamic ice growth and dynamic thickening during the ice-growing season in the central Arctic Ocean. As an indicator of the thermodynamic ice growth, we use 10 thermistor string-based sea ice mass balance array (SIMBA) buoys deployed at a scale of -50 km from the Icebreaker Polarstern during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition. We collect IS2 data within 20 km buffer distance from the individual buoys, and calculate the mode, median, and mean of the IS2-derived ice thickness. The IS2 modal thickness shows the least bias (-0.169 m) with the buoy ice thickness, representing level ice thickness. In addition, the increasing rate of the IS2 modal thickness is close to the thermodynamic ice growth with a small bias of -0.054 cm/day. However, the increasing rates of the IS2 median and mean thickness are greater than the thermodynamic ice growth by about 0.114 cm/day and 0.198 cm/day, respectively, because they also include ice growth caused by thickness redistribution during dynamic deformation. The dynamic contributions may account for 26.1 +/- 10.3% and 34.4 +/- 10.1% of the total increase of the IS2 median and mean thickness, respectively. Within a - 50 km radius area from the MOSAiC Central Observatory, IS2 measurements exhibit that the ridge fraction increased from <2% in November to -4% in March (-0.029%/day of average increasing rate) and ridge height increased about 0.047 cm/day during the same period. However, lead formation does not show significant contributions to the dynamic ice thickening because leads are temporary features lasting only 2-3 days. Although there are considerable uncertainties in IS2 ice thickness estimation and IS2-buoy thickness comparison, this study emphasizes the importance of combining measurements by IS2 and SIMBA buoys to explain the regional sea ice mass balance with separating the thermodynamic and dynamic contributions.

AB Constraint of the vertical distribution of aerosol particles is crucial for the study of aerosol plume structure, aerosol radiative effects, and ultimately monitoring surface air pollution. We developed an algorithm to retrieve the aerosol optical central height (AOCH) of absorbing aerosols by using, for the first time, the oxygen (O-2) A and B absorption band measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) over dark targets. For the retrieval, narrow band radiance at seven channels ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to shortwave infrared (SWIR) are convolved from TROPOMI hyperspectral measurements. Subsequently, cloudy pixels are screened out by using the slope of spectral reflectance, while aerosol types (dust and smoke) are classified by the wavelength dependence of aerosol path radiance in conjunction with UV aerosol index. Surface reflectance over land is derived from the MODIS surface bi-directional reflectance climatology, and over water from the GOME-2 surface Lambert-equivalent reflectivity (LER) database. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) and AOCH are retrieved through an approach of look-up-table accounting for AERONET-based dust and smoke optical properties. For multiple smoke and dust plume events around the world, our retrieved AOCH values agree with space-borne lidar CALIOP counterparts, with a mean bias of <0.15 km and a correlation coefficient of 0.85-0.87. Due in part to adding the O-2 B band, our retrieval represents an aerosol extinction peak height better than the TROPOMI operational Level 2 aerosol layer height retrieved from only the O-2 A band. The latter shows 0.5-2 km low bias, especially over land. Finally, the high potential of AOCH for improving surface PM2.5 estimates is also illustrated with a case study in which the high bias of surface PM2.5 in MERRA-2 data is corrected after being scaled by the retrieved AOCH.

AB Hyperspectral airborne imagery can provide rich information on plant physiological and structural properties at a scale intermediate to that of proximal and satellite remote sensing and has broad applications in assessing ecosystem function and biodiversity. A key processing step of airborne hyperspectral data is the atmospheric correction that compensates for path radiance, aerosol effects and gas absorption to derive an accurate surface reflectance that can be compared across time and space. In practice, routine correction procedures are often customized for various platforms without fully reporting or checking the errors systematically in the atmospheric correction. Such errors can have significant effects on downstream analyses such as vegetation indices or trait retrievals, and not all subsequent analyses are equally affected by the accuracy of reflectance retrievals. In this study, we examined the errors in three types of atmospheric correction methods including a radiative transfer model (RTM), empirical line correction (ELC) and a hybrid method that combines elements of the two via Bayesian inference. Our results revealed that the individual correction methods had different effects on the reflectance retrievals that impacted downstream measurements. Including spectral measurements from ground vegetation targets in addition to painted calibration targets improved the performance of the ELC method. The hybrid method yielded reflectance spectra that most closely matched the spectra of the ground validation data. The errors in vegetation indices differed with the methods, and certain indices (such as PRI) were more affected than indices that rely on stable, broader spectral features (e.g., NDVI). Plant pigment retrievals via partial least squares regression were less sensitive to errors in atmospheric correction. These findings demonstrate that obtaining high-quality, field spectral measurements over well-characterized calibration targets and representative land cover types within the scene is critical for accurate surface reflectance and subsequent downstream products, such as vegetation indices or plant traits.

AB Multi-temporal deep learning approaches have exhibited excellent classification performance in large-scale crop mapping. These approaches efficiently and automatically transform remote sensing time series into highdimensional feature representations to identify crop types. The lack of interpretation, however, is regarded as a major drawback of these high-performance approaches. Interpreting deep learning approaches in multitemporal crop mapping is critical for verifying their reliability. This study aims to quantify the impact of multi-temporal information in input time series on classification performance and develop a multi-perspective interpretation pipeline for deep learning models. The pipeline involves three interpretation approaches: evaluating input feature importance, analyzing hidden features, and monitoring temporal changes in model's soft output. An experiment is conducted to classify corn and soybean in the U.S corn belt in 2018. The study area consists of three sites each encompassing millions of pixel-level samples at 30 m resolution. The Landsat Analysis Ready Data are used as the input remote sensing time series and Cropland Data Layer is used as the ground reference. Attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (AtLSTM) and Transformer models are built as multitemporal deep learning models, and compared to Random Forest (RF). Complete time series input in the correct order achieves a higher overall accuracy of 97.8% than using single-window or out-of-order inputs, indicating multi-temporal information facilitates crop classification. An assessment of the input feature importance demonstrates that the AtLSTM, Transformer, and RF models all consider the period from weeks 11 to 20 (earlyJuly to late-August) as a key growth period and the shortwave infrared band as the critical band for corn and soybean discrimination. Hidden feature analysis suggests that the AtLSTM model accumulates the useful information over the growth period, while the Transformer model extracts the temporal dependencies that contribute important information to high-level feature learning. The learned features contain more effective and refined information than the raw input features and thus are better suited for crop classification. The soft output analysis in the in-season classification scenario demonstrates that increased length of input time series improves the model's confidence in the classification results. The further comparison of input feature importance in different sites and years demonstrates the applicability of the interpretation approach at larger spatiotemporal extents with heterogeneous landscapes and interannual variability. This study provides a multi-perspective evaluation to identify key features in multi-spectral and multi-temporal remote sensing data, and yields a practical approach to integrate agronomy knowledge in deep learning-based crop mapping.

AB With the development of remote sensing technology, satellite-based soil moisture estimates become more and more available, and the potential of using satellite soil moisture products in landslide hazard assessment has been widely recognized. However, to our knowledge, there is a lack of studies exploring the performance difference of various satellite soil moisture products for such an application. Therefore, this study aims to compare several state-of-the-art satellite soil moisture products on their potentials in landslide applications. The selected products include the ESA CCI soil moisture dataset, the SMAP Level-3 (L3), enhanced Level-3 (L3), Level-4 (L4) surface, and Level-4 (L4) root zone soil moisture datasets. Specifically, the completeness of different datasets is calculated to assess their applicability in practical applications. To investigate the relationship between the soil moisture and the commonly used rainfall information in landslide predictions, the correlation study of the satellite soil moisture with the antecedent cumulated rainfall is also carried out. In addition, to explore whether the satellite soil moisture can provide valuable information for landslide hazard assessment, infiltration events are identified based on the time series of satellite soil moisture, and the significance of event characteristics (such as event duration, soil moisture change, etc.) in landslide occurrence is then investigated with Bayesian analysis. This study is carried out in a landslide-prone area, the Emilia-Romagna region in northern Italy. Results show that the SMAP L4 product does not have any missing values, beneficial to the continuous monitoring of landslides. As for the correlation relationship between soil moisture and antecedent cumulated rainfall, the SMAP L4 product also has more rational spatial distribution of the Pearson correlation coefficients compared with other datasets, which can be better explained by the distribution of slope and TWI (topographic wetness index). Bayesian analysis on the infiltration events shows that our prior knowledge of the probability of landslide occurrence is better improved by using the 'SMAP L4 root zone soil moisture'-derived infiltration events, indicating its greater potential to be used for landslide hazard assessment in the study region.

AB With the advent of the next generation of space-based laser altimeters, ICESat-2 and GEDI, we are entering an exciting era of active remote sensing of forests that offers unprecedented opportunities for the observation of forest structure. Consistent comparisons of the accuracy of terrain and canopy height retrievals for these two missions are essential for continued improvement and further application. Because the time interval between the spaceborne products and validation data may introduce additional errors, we validate the newly released GEDI L2A product (version 2) and the ICESat-2 ATL08 product (version 4) using high-resolution, locally calibrated airborne lidar products acquired in the same year (2019) as the reference datasets. In addition, our study area contains 40 sites located in the U.S. mainland, Alaska, and Hawaii that encompass a variety of eco-climatic zones and vegetation cover types; thus, it avoids the uncertainties associated with small sample sizes and restricted spatial coverage. The results show that ICESat-2 and GEDI yield reasonable estimates of terrain height, with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of 2.24 and 4.03 m for mid and low latitudes, respectively, and 0.98 m for high latitudes (ICESat-2 only). ICESat-2 outperforms GEDI across the board for terrain height retrieval, although they both have better accuracy than existing SRTM and GMTED DEM products. Analyses of the error factors suggest that steep slopes (>30 degrees) present the greatest challenge for both GEDI and ICESat-2; in addition, tall (>20 m) and dense canopies (>90%) forest ecosystems also reduce the accuracy of the terrain height estimates. When ICESat2 and GEDI data are used for canopy height retrieval, the use of only strong/power beam data acquired at night is recommended, as the overall RMSEs decrease from 7.21 and 5.02 m to 3.93 and 3.56 m, respectively, compared to using all data regardless of daytime and beam strength. GEDI outperforms ICESat-2 across the board for canopy height retrieval, as ICESat-2 has a larger potential bias for almost all forest types and cover conditions. ICESat-2 tends to overestimate the canopy height of dwarf shrublands and underestimate the canopy height of forest, and there is a gradual downward shift in the distribution of residuals with increasing canopy height. Overall, ICESat-2 with photon counting technology and GEDI with full waveform technology each represent the state of the art in spaceborne laser altimeters for terrain and canopy height retrieval. Combined, these two missions can take advantage of the unique strengths of each instrument.

AB This study presents an assessment of a pre-operational soil moisture product at 1 km resolution derived from satellite data acquired by the European Radar Observatory Sentinel-1 (S-1), representing the first space component of the Copernicus program. The product consists of an estimate of surface soil volumetric water content Theta [m(3)/m(3)] and its uncertainty [m(3)/m(3)], both at 1 km. The retrieval algorithm relies on a time series based Short Term Change Detection (STCD) approach, taking advantage of the frequent revisit of the S-1 constellation that performs C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging. The performance of the S-1 Theta product is estimated through a direct comparison between 1068 S-1 Theta images against in situ Theta measurements acquired by 167 ground stations located in Europe, America and Australia, over 4 years between January 2015 and December 2020, depending on the site. The paper develops a method to estimate the spatial representativeness error (SRE) that arises from the mismatch between the S-1 Theta retrieved at 1 km resolution and the in situ point-scale Theta observations. The impact of SRE on standard validation metrics, i.e., root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation (R) and linear regression, is quantified and experimentally assessed using S-1 and ground Theta data collected over a dense hydrologic network (4-5 stations/km(2)) located in the Apulian Tavoliere (Southern Italy). Results show that for the dense hydrological network the RMSE and correlation are similar to 0.06 m(3)/m(3) and 0.71, respectively, whereas for the sparse hydrological networks, i.e., 1 station/km(2), the SRE increases the RMSE by similar to 0.02 m(3)/m(3) (70% Confidence Level). Globally, the S-1 Theta product is characterized by an intrinsic (i.e., with SRE removed) RMSE of similar to 0.07 m(3)/m(3) over the Theta range [0.03, 0.60] m(3)/m(3) and R of 0.54. A breakdown of the RMSE per dry, medium and wet Theta ranges is also derived and its implications for setting realistic requirements for SAR-based Theta retrieval are discussed together with recommendations for the density of in situ Theta observations.

AB The ability to detect and map invasive plants to the species level, both at high resolution and over large extents, is essential for their targeted management. Yet development of such remote sensing methodology is challenged by the spectral and structural similarities among many invasive and native plant species. We developed a multi-temporal classification approach that uses unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAV) imagery to map two invasive annual grasses to the species level, and to distinguish these from key functional types of native vegetation, based upon differences in plant phenology. For a case study area in the western Great Basin, USA, we intentionally over-sampled with frequent (n = 8) UAV flights over the growing season. Using this information we compared the importance of spectral variation at a given point in time (i.e., with and without near-infrared wavelengths), with spectral variation across multiple time periods. We found that differences in species phenology allowed for accurate classification of nine cover types, including the two annual grass species of interest, using just three dates of imagery that captured species-specific differences in the timing of active growth, seed head production, and senescence. Availability of near-infrared imagery proved less important than true-color RGB imagery collected at appropriate time periods. Thus, multi-temporal information provides a substitute for more extensive spectral information obtained from a single point in time. The substitution of temporal for spectral information is particularly well suited to UAV remote sensing, where the timing of image collection can be flexible. The datasets arising from our multi-temporal classification approach provide high-resolution information for modeling patterns of invasive plant spread, for quantifying plant invasion risk, and for early detection of novel plant invasions when patch sizes are still small. Widespread application and up-scaling of our approach requires advances in our ability to model the variability in phenology that occurs across years and over fine spatial scales, even within a single species.

AB Secondary succession (SS) is one of the main consequences of the abandonment of agricultural and forestry practices in rural areas, causing-among other processes-woody encroachment on former pastures and croplands. In this study we model and monitor the spatial evolution of SS over semi-natural grassland communities in the mountain range of the Pyrenees in Spain, during the last 36 years (1984-2019). Independent variables for 'annual-based' and `period-based' modeling were drawn from a suite of Surface Reflectance Landsat images, LandTrendr (LT)-algorithm-adjusted images and LT outputs. Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained and tested using all possible variable combinations of all the aforementioned datasets. The best modeling strategy involved yearly time series of LT-adjusted Tasseled Cap Brightness (TCB) and Wetness (TCW) axes as predictors, attaining a F1-score of 0.85, a Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.67 and an AUC 0.83. Woodlands encroached above 480,000 ha of grasslands and crops during the study period. A model using LT outputs for the whole period also denoted good performance (F1-score = 0.85, MCC = 0.75) and estimated a similar area of woodland expansion (similar to 509,000 ha), but this 'period' approach was unable to provide temporal information on the year or the encroachment dynamics. Our results suggest an overall proportion of 66% for the Pyrenees being affected by SS, with higher intensity in the west-central part, decreasing towards the eastern end.

AB Incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is a key parameter in plant physiological, biological and physical process-based terrestrial ecosystem models. Deriving highly accurate and spatially continuous PAR from remote sensing data can fill in the gaps of insufficient ground-based measurements. In this study, we provide an efficient approach for estimating PAR by employing look-up table (LUT) method using observations from both MODIS and GOES-16. The GOES-16 is the first satellite of the new-generation US Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-series (GOES-R), which can capture dynamic changes in the atmosphere every 5 min. First, the diurnal variation of surface bidirectional reflectance is characterized assuming that the surface characteristics and solar zenith angles in tropical and middle latitudes at a given time of day do not change dramatically within a month. Next, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud optical depth (COD) are retrieved from the GOES-16 visible observations under both clear-sky and cloudy conditions. Finally, PAR is estimated via the retrieved AOD and COD using the LUT method and a MODIS-based surface albedo product. The estimated PAR was compared against ground-based measurements collected from seven SURFace RADiation budget network (SURFRAD) sites and 23 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites at instantaneous, hourly and daily scales. The instantaneous PAR validation results achieved R-2 values of 0.97 and 0.82, and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 18.1 and 51.1 W m(-2), for clear and cloudy skies, respectively. The RMSEs of the hourly averaged PAR were reduced to 16.8 W m(-2) and 40.4 W m(-2), respectively, for clear-sky and cloudy conditions. The daily mean PAR evaluation for all sky conditions shows an overall mean bias error (MBE) of 0.97 W m(-2) and an RMSE of 10.5 W m(-2). Compared with other global PAR datasets, the estimated PAR values in this study have lower RMSEs and higher spatial-temporal resolution. Uncertainties in the retrieved PAR caused by topography and solar-cloud-geometry effects (SCGE) can be reduced by spatial and temporal averaging. Based on an evaluation of retrievals at different spatial-temporal scales, we recommend that a 20 x 20 km(2) domainaveraged PAR be utilized for instantaneous PAR validation, whereas hourly and daily averaged PAR values are nearly independent of spatial scale.

AB Despite the importance of remote detection of marine debris, nearly all published studies are focused on either controlled experiments, or Sentinel-2 data with mixed band resolutions that are subject to large uncertainties. To date, key questions such as the following have not been addressed adequately: To what extent can the various forms of marine debris be remotely detected and differentiated through satellite observations in the visible and near infrared (NIR) spectral range, and how? Here, using published reflectance spectra of various types of floating matters, I address these questions through sensitivity analyses, simulations, and spectral analyses of satellite images. While the study is by no means comprehensive, several observations can still be made. First, it appears impossible to remotely detect marine microplastics from all existing and planned optical sensors. This is simply because the contribution of these particles to the sensor signal, even when they are aggregated on the water surface at the reported maximum particle density, is at least 60 times lower than the required signal (similar to 0.2% subpixel coverage) and 20 times lower than the sensor noise for a sensor with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 200. In contrast, detecting macroplastics and other debris is possible when they form large patches along ocean fronts or windrows. Second, assuming a SNR of 200, discriminating large patches of marine debris from floating algae is only possible with a subpixel coverage of 0.3%. These threshold values are based on the sensor SNRs only, and they represent the lower bounds of detection and discrimination, respectively. The real threshold values above which a detection or discrimination is possible also depend on the observing conditions, and therefore higher. Third, currently, Sentinel-2 MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument) sensors provide an optimal trade between resolution and coverage, yet MSI sensors have SNRs <200, and interpretation of the MSI spectra requires extra caution due to variable spatial resolutions in different bands, among other factors. From the perspective of pure spectroscopy, it is possible to discriminate floating algae from non-algae floating matters but difficult to differentiate the type of the latter (either plastic or non-plastic debris, foam, etc) because different non-algae floating matters all show relatively flat reflectance spectral shapes in the vis-NIR spectral range. Finally, based on these results, recommendations are made on algorithm designs and sensor designs, for example spectral analysis should be performed over the difference spectra to minimize the impact of variable subpixel coverage, and certain spectral bands are more important than others for the remote detection of marine debris.

AB Coastal floodplain swamps (CFS) are an important part of the coastal wetland mosaic, however they are threatened due to accelerated rates of sea level rise and saltwater intrusion (SWI). While remote sensing-based detection of wholesale coastal ecosystem shifts (i.e., from forest to marsh) are relatively straightforward, assessments of chronic, low-level SWI into CFS using remote sensing have yet to be developed and can provide a critical early-warning signal of ecosystem deterioration. In this study, we developed nine ecologically-based hypotheses to test whether remote sensing data could be used to reliably detect the presence of CFS experiencing SWI. Hypotheses were motivated by field- and literature-based understanding of the phenological and vegetative dynamics of CFS experiencing SWI relative to unimpacted, control systems. Hypotheses were organized into two primary groups: those that analyzed differences in summary measures (e.g., median and distribution) between SWI-impacted and unimpacted control sites and those that examined timeseries trends (e.g., sign and magnitude of slope). The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was used as a proxy for production/biomass and was generated using MODIS surface reflectance data spanning 2000 to 2018. Experimental sites (n = 8) were selected from an existing network of long-term monitoring sites and included 4 pairs of impacted/non-impacted CFS across the northern Gulf of Mexico from Texas to Florida. The four best-supported hypotheses (81% across all sties) all used summary statistics, indicating that there were significant differences in the EVI of CFS experiencing chronic, low-level SWI compared to controls. These hypotheses were tested using data across a large and diverse region, supporting their implementation by researchers and managers seeking to identify CFS undergoing the first phases of SWI. In contrast, hypotheses that assessed CFS change over time were poorly supported, likely due to the slow and variable pace of ecological change, relatively short remote sensing data record, and/or specific site histories. Overall, these results show that remote sensing data can be used to identify differences in CFS vegetation associated with long-term, low-level SWI, but further methodological advancements are needed to reliably detect the temporal transition process.

DE Ocean colour; OLCI Sentinel-3A; Remote sensing of coastal waters;
   Northeast Pacific coast
AB Coastal oceans play a pivotal role in fisheries production and global biogeochemical cycles, making large-scale monitoring an essential task. The advent of modern remote sensors, such as OLCI (Ocean Land Colour Instrument), on board the Sentinel-3A satellite, has made it possible to obtain oceanic biogeochemical products at higher spatial (300 m) and temporal (daily) resolutions than previously possible. However, validating the Sentinel-3A retrievals for coastal waters is an ongoing effort. Using a regional in situ dataset from British Columbia (BC) and Southeast Alaska (SEA) coastal waters, we evaluated the performance of OLCI Sentinel-3A in retrieving remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) and biophysical products, including total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The OLCI data were processed through a spectral optimization-based algorithm (POLYMER) and a neural net-based (NN) algorithm (C2RCC), including the original (C2RCC v1) and the alternative version (altNN or v2), in which the neural network was trained with extended ranges to cope with larger dynamic range for high backscatter waters. The processors? performance was evaluated through match-up analysis using data from southern BC, as well as expected ranges and seasonal trends for northern BC and SEA. Multimetric statistical analyses demonstrated that POLYMER provided the best overall performance for TSM and Chl-a retrievals, with the Chl-a product improved by the use of the so-called ?Case-2? flag. Despite the relative outperformance of POLYMER-derived products, with low systematic biases, the relative percent differences are still high (80?100%) and should be acknowledged in future analyses when using these data. CDOM, only retrieved here from NN approaches, was better estimated using the alternative version of C2RCC. The best performing approaches were used to evaluate Level-3 composites for northern BC and SEA waters. The observed spatial and seasonal trends compared favourably with those reported in the literature, including highlighting more productive areas (e.g. west coast of Vancouver Island), and the important interactions between riverine systems and adjacent coastal waters (e.g., high TSM and CDOM loads near the Skeena and Nass rivers). This study demonstrated the benefits of OLCI Sentinel-3A to investigate complex coastal ecosystems and provides a robust evaluation of OLCI performance and a framework for future observational and process-oriented studies.

AB Accurate mapping of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is critical for better understanding the role of forests in the global carbon cycle. NASA's current GEDI and ICESat-2 missions as well as the upcoming NISAR mission will collect synergistic data with different coverage and sensitivity to AGB. In this study, we present a multi-sensor data fusion approach leveraging the strength of each mission to produce wall-to-wall AGB maps that are more accurate and spatially comprehensive than what is achievable with any one sensor alone. Specifically, we calibrate a regional L-band radar AGB model using the sparse, simulated spaceborne lidar AGB estimates. We assess our data fusion framework using simulations of GEDI, ICESat-2 and NISAR data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and UAVSAR data acquired over the temperate high AGB forest and complex terrain in Sonoma County, California, USA. For ICESat-2 and GEDI missions, we simulate two years of data coverage and AGB at footprint level are estimated using realistic AGB models. We compare the performance of our fusion framework when different combinations of the sparse simulated GEDI and ICEsat-2 AGB estimates are used to calibrate our regional L-band AGB models. In addition, we test our framework at Sonoma using (a) 1-ha square grid cells and (b) similarly sized irregularly shaped objects. We demonstrate that the estimated mean AGB across Sonoma is more accurately estimated using our fusion framework than using GEDI or ICESat-2 mission data alone, either with a regular grid or with irregular segments as mapping units. This research highlights methodological opportunities for fusing new and upcoming active remote sensing data streams toward improved AGB mapping through data fusion.

AB Understanding how resilient rangelands are to climatic disturbances such as drought is of major importance to land managers. The resilience of ecosystems can be reduced by livestock grazing and by environmental conditions. Most studies quantifying resilience are based on model simulations. However, natural time series from satellite data offer the possibility to infer aspects of resilience from real systems. The objective of this study was to investigate two aspects of ecological resilience, namely resistance to climate variability and recovery from drought, by applying a change detection method (Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend; BFAST) spatially on a 28-year Landsat NDVI time series in a dry rangeland in southern Cyprus. First, we used the number of breakpoints fitted by the BFAST model as an inverted proxy for long-term vegetation resistance to climate variability (the ability to withstand change during a disturbance reduces the likelihood to trigger a breakpoint in the time series). Second, we used the linear slope of the BFAST model after a known drought as a proxy of the recovery rate of the vegetation. This information was then used to analyse the spatial distribution of the total number of breakpoints and of the NDVI recovery trend in relation to grazing and environmental properties. Our results show that high NDVI and a northern orientation (i.e. favourable environmental conditions) were associated with a highly resilient system, due to high resistance to climate variability and fast recovery after drought. Intermediate conditions were associated with low resistance. Unfavourable conditions and high grazing intensities were associated with an unresponsive ecosystem state characterised by high resistance and slow recovery after a drought event. Low grazing intensities positively affected the NDVI recovery trend, but did not improve resistance. On northern slopes, terrain slope had a positive effect on the NDVI recovery trend, while on southern slopes it had a negative effect. Our satellite-driven approach has a strong potential for resilience monitoring, because it can be applied on broad spatial and temporal scales in areas with low availability of field data. Moreover, it allows to jointly extract two important components of resilience: resistance and recovery rate.

AB The way in which temporal dynamics structure ecological systems under the influence of a changing environment has long interested ecologists. Tackling the hierarchical structure of complex temporal patterns is a necessary step towards a more complete description of the fundamental nature of temporal dynamics in ecosystems. In pursuance of this task, remote sensing data provide valuable information to classify and describe functional features of ecosystems across scales. To approach the temporal complexity of ecosystems, we proposed a stepwise procedure based on combinations of big data techniques and time series analyses applied to data series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The aim was to classify the temporal patterns and identify the differences in temporal dynamics of vegetation, by means of the frequency-domain and time-frequency domain components of a 20-year period of NDVI time series, respectively. In addition, we analysed the influence of climate in the temporal dynamics of vegetation. In particular, we applied archetype analysis to fast Fourier transform coefficients, using pixels as analytical units and frequencies as variables, of a large study area from North Patagonia, Argentina. Then, the most representative pixels for each archetype were used to analyse the explained variance by climatic predictor variables (temperature and precipitation) using a multiplicative model, whereas NDVI temporal dynamics was also described by means of time-frequency domain components with wavelet analysis, respectively. Six archetypes of temporal dynamics of arid and semi-arid rangelands were identified, as well as the main patterns of their distinctive frequencies through time and spatial location, respectively. The differences in temporal dynamics among archetypes were partly associated with climate and spatial features such as topography. The procedure was sensitive to capturing these temporal patterns, even those with a low data representation or noisy series while synthesizing information for an easy interpretation. Results are discussed in the light of future opportunities to combine this kind of information with other sources of information, aiming at the development of reliable land degradation and desertification assessment and monitoring tools.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a vital parameter for the achievement of the surface energy budget and in thorough investigations of water cycle processes. Lightweight thermal infrared (TIR) sensors onboard unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are rapidly becoming key instruments for extracting high-resolution LSTs given the flexibility they offer in capturing different scales. With this expansion, there has been increasing concern regarding the growing demand to obtain a mapping of normalized LST given the directional anisotropy (DA) of surface fine-scale emissions. To date, this topic suffers from a lack of deep analysis and practical solutions for characterizing the DA of fine-scale TIR data from UAV measurements over tree and crop canopies. In this paper, the first objective was to understand the pattern of brightness temperatures (BTs) DAs at a high spatial resolution by using UAV-based multiangle observations and three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer model simulations. This study highlighted the need for first performing an angular normalization of the BTs of fine-scale pixels prior to any application, as these were easily affected by adjacent pixels and displayed broad spatial variability from 0.5 degrees C to 5.0 degrees C due to 3D occlusion. The second objective of the present study was to appraise the reliability of a modified kernel-driven model, in comparison to the model from which it was derived, with an additional kernel designed to mimic the adjacency effect, plus, a quadratic function used to simplify the estimate of the directional emissivity kernel. The root mean square error of the best fit between the measured UAV dataset and the modified kernel-driven model was approximately 0.65 degrees C, which proves its efficiency since the DA indexes of the BTs were about 1.40 degrees C. This outlined the role of the model to normalize from directional effects the camera image pixels and thereby deliver fine-scale BTs. In addition, results from LESS simulations also demonstrated the good performance of the modified kernel-driven model for simulating the DAs of thermal emissions for both tree and row-planted scenes.

AB NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) launched in the fall of 2018 and is collecting ve-getation canopy height and terrain measurements globally. In this paper we validate the terrain and canopy heights estimated from 11 months of ICESat-2 data using airborne lidar data collected in southern Finland. Overall, the terrain heights from the ATL08 data product agreed with the airborne lidar with vertical errors less than 75 cm (mean = -0.07 m; MAE = 0.53 m, RMSE = 0.73 m; n observations = 909,467). ATL08 terrain heights had positive bias (33 cm) when permanent snow cover was present compared to the airborne lidar. Canopy heights derived from ICESat-2 varied significantly by the beam selection (i.e. strong versus weak). Use of the weak beams increased the underestimation of canopy height by 1.06 m and increased RMSE% by 8.08%. The lowest canopy height errors were associated with strong beam/night/summer ATL08 acquisitions, which underestimated canopy height by 0.56 m (Bias% = 3.18; RMSE% of 13.75%), followed by strong beam/day/summer acquisitions (Bias% = 2.85%; RMSE% = 14.77%). For this study area with managed, coniferous dominated boreal forests, we found that ATL08 canopy height errors were lowest for canopy cover ranging from 40 to 85% and within this range, we found that on average, ICESat-2 missed the top 11-13% of canopy heights. At low canopy cover (< 40%), photons are more likely to be reflected from the terrain surface rather than the canopy due to the lower amount of vegetation present. Although not designed for canopy height retrievals, herein we have demonstrated that ICESat-2 can provide a useful source of canopy height information in boreal forests. By quantifying the accuracy with which terrain and canopy heights are characterized by ATL08, we provide insights on the capabilities and limitations of these data for these applications. Our results indicate that end users interested in canopy height retrievals in particular should avoid the use of weak beam data in boreal forest conditions.

AB Within-crown heterogeneity exists in multiple vegetation scenes including forest stands with heterogeneous distribution of damaged foliage. The existing radiative transfer approaches implement the within-crown het-erogeneity either using complicated three-dimensional (3D) scenes with excessive amounts of parameters, or simplifying the scenes to homogeneous cases by averaging canopy optical properties. In order to ascertain the optical response to within-crown heterogeneity both efficiently and accurately, we proposed a method for simulating bi-directional reflectance factor (BRF) of forests infected by pests based on the stochastic radiative transfer (SRT) theory. Each damaged tree crown was classified into one of the three types: top-only damage, bottom-only damage and random damage. The statistical properties of such canopy structures were described with extended definitions of the stochastic moments of the SRT model, including the probabilities of finding different foliage classes and the conditional pair-correlation functions between healthy and damaged foliage. Field measurements and remote sensing data from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) over infected Yunnan Pine (Pinus yunnanensis) forests, and simulations of two 3D models were utilized to evaluate the performance. Results showed that the extended SRT agreed well with 3D models and field measurements, which means it has the capability to model BRF over forests with heterogeneous foliage within crowns based on one-dimensional (1D) theory. The extended SRT provides a framework to analyze the sensitivity of canopy reflectance to the distribution of damaged foliage with the variation of other key scene factors. For the three types of damaged tree crowns, the thresholds of detectable optical changes were quite different, in which 20% for top-only damage, 80% for bottom-only damage and 50% for random damage. The uncertainties caused by other scene factors were also considered. The extended SRT is promising for crown vertical profile specification, forest damage quantitative inversion, and other applications with coupling models.

AB Accurate and high-resolution sea ice surface temperature (IST) data is of great importance for Arctic climate studies. However, the validation of high-resolution IST data using in situ measurements in polar sea ice regions is lacking. This study assesses the accuracy of three split-window (SW) and two single-channel (SC) methods, based on Landsat 8 thermal infrared imagery at 100 m resolution over Arctic sea ice regions. The SW methods are proposed by Jin et al. (2015) (SW-Jin), Jimenez-Munoz et al. (2014) (SW-JM), and Du et al. (2015) (SW-Du). The SC methods are proposed by Jimenez-Munoz et al. (2014) (SC-JM) and Barsi et al. (2003, 2005) (SC-Barsi). IST data derived from 58 scenes of the Landsat 8 images were compared with coincident in situ ice skin temperatures and near-surface air temperatures, as measured by a combination of Ice Mass Balance (IMB) buoys, Snow and Ice Mass Balance Array (SIMBA) buoys, and automatic weather stations. SW-Du offers the best accuracy when compared with the skin temperature (bias: -1.06 K; root mean square error (RMSE): 2.08 K) and near-surface air temperature (bias:-0.98 K; RMSE: 2.17 K). SC-Barsi ranks second, with a bias of -1.55 K and RMSE of 2.40 K for the skin temperature. As for precision, IST from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) has best performance (standard deviation (STD): 1.69 K), followed by SW-Du, SW-JM, and SC-Barsi (STD: 1.80 K, 1.82 K, and 1.85 K, respectively). The Landsat IST outperforms the MODIS IST in narrow lead areas, owing to its better spatial resolution, and SW-JM and SC-Barsi methods agree best with the MODIS IST in leads and marginal ice zone scenes, respectively. As all three SW methods are constrained by banding effects with different degrees in a lead scene, they are not recommended to be applied on an image scene with severe banding artifacts. The small bias (1.26 K) and high correlation (0.99) between skin temperature and near-surface air temperature prove the capability of using near-surface air temperature as a substitute for validating a satellite IST data if skin temperature data are not available.

AB A Feed Forward Neural Net (NN) approach to distinguish between clouds and the surface has been applied to the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer in polar regions. The masking algorithm covers the Arctic, Antarctic and regions typically classified as the cryosphere such as northern hemisphere permafrost. The mask has been trained using collocations with the CALIOP active lidar, which in narrow strips provide more accurate detection of cloud, and was subsequently evaluated as a function of cloud type and surface type. The mask was compared with the existing operational Bayesian and Empirical cloud masks by eye and also statistically using CALIOP data. It was found to perform exceptionally well in the polar regions. The Kuiper skill score improved from 0.28, for the operational Bayesian and 0.17 for the Empirical masks to 0.77 for the NN. The NN algorithm also has a much more homogeneous performance over all surface types. The key improvement came from better identification of clear scenes; for the NN mask, the same performance in terms of contamination of cloudy pixels in the sample of identified clear pixels can be achieved while retaining 40% of the clear pixels compared with 10% for the operational cloud identification. The algorithm performed with almost the same skill over sea and land. The best performance was achieved for opaque clouds while transparent and broken clouds showed slightly reduced accuracy.

AB The long-term urban dynamics at regional and global scales is essential to understanding the urbanization processes and environmental consequences for providing better scientific insights and effective decision-making. The time series of consistent nighttime light (NTL) data generated by integrating the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescane System (DMSP-OLS) and the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) provide a longer consistent record of the nightscape beyond a single dataset for monitoring urban dynamics. In this study, we developed a new framework based on the spatial variation of NTL gradient (SVNG) to map urban dynamics in Southeast Asia using the consistent NTL data (1992-2018). First, we identified the potential urban clusters in the region using the cluster-based segmentation approach in 2018. Second, we applied the SVNG framework in each potential urban cluster to extract the initial annual urban extent from corresponding time-series NTL images (1992-2018). Finally, we performed a temporal consistency check on the initial urban extent to obtain the final urban sequence in Southeast Asia. The evaluation on the spatiotemporal patterns and consistency of urban dynamics using other urban products indicates that the SVNG framework can effectively capture the urban dynamics in areas with different development levels and patterns. Moreover, we investigated urban dynamics in Southeast Asia at the local, national, and regional scales. This study opens new research avenues for monitoring and understanding the long-term urban dynamics and the pathways of urban growth from local to global scales.

AB Providing accurate information on fire effects is critical to understanding post-fire ecological processes and to design appropriate land management strategies. Multispectral imagery from optical passive sensors is commonly used to estimate fire damage, yet this type of data is only sensitive to the effects in the upper canopy. This paper evaluates the sensitivity of full waveform LiDAR data to estimate the severity of wildfires using a 3D radiative transfer model approach. The approach represents the first attempt to evaluate the effect of different fire impacts, i.e. changes in vegetation structure as well as soil and leaf color, on the LiDAR signal. The FLIGHT 3D radiative transfer model was employed to simulate full waveform data for 10 plots representative of Mediterranean ecosystems along with a wide range of post-fire scenarios characterized by different severity levels, as defined by the composite burn index (CBI). A new metric is proposed, the waveform area relative change (WARC), which provides a comprehensive severity assessment considering all strata and accounting for changes in structure and leaf and soil color. It showed a strong correlation with CBI values (Spearman's Rho = 0.9 +/- 0.02), outperforming the relative change of LiDAR metrics commonly applied for vegetation modeling, such as the relative height of energy quantiles (Spearman's Rho = 0.56 +/- 0.07, for the relative change of RH60, the second strongest correlation). Logarithmic models fitted for each plot based on the WARC yielded very good performance with R-2 (+/- standard deviation) and RMSE (+/- standard deviation) of 0.8 (+/- 0.05) and 0.22 (+/- 0.03), respectively. LiDAR metrics were evaluated over the King Fire, California, U.S., for which pre- and post-fire discrete return airborne LiDAR data were available. Pseudo-waveforms were computed after radiometric normalization of the intensity data. The WARC showed again the strongest correlation with field measures of GeoCBI values (Spearman's Rho = 0.91), closely followed by the relative change of RH40 (Spearman's Rho = 0.89). The logarithmic model fitted using WARC offered an R-2 of 0.78 and a RMSE of 0.37. The accurate results obtained for the King Fire, with very different vegetation characteristics compared to our simulated data, demonstrate the robustness of the new metric proposed and its generalization capabilities to estimate the severity of fires.

AB Precise delineation of river networks is important for accurate hydrological and flood modelling. Whilst remote sensing (RS) has showed great potential in monitoring hydrological changes over space and time, the existing RS-based methods extract river networks based on local morphologies and seldom take into account the overall hydrological connectivity of the rivers. The existing methods also commonly neglect the effect of seasonal variation of water surfaces and the existence of temporary water bodies, which deteriorate the precision of positioning river networks. To address these challenges, a new two-stage method is developed to Extract spatiotemporal variation of water surfaces based on Multi-temporal remote sensing Imagery and Delineate connected river networks with improved accuracy (EMID method for short) using a path tracking technique. The EMID method delineates connected river networks using (a) multi-temporal imagery and a Random Forest model to synoptically map the location and extent of water surfaces under different hydrological conditions, and (b) an optimization algorithm to find the best river paths based on water-occurrence frequency. Four drainage basins with various river morphologies are considered to validate EMID. Comparing with alternative methods, the EMID method consistently produces river network results with improved accuracy in terms of stream location, river coverage and network connectivity.

AB Knowledge on forest structure is vital for sustainable forest management decisions. Currently, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) has been well established as an effective tool to delineate and characterize the structure of canopies across a range of forested biomes. However, the use of ALS to provide information on sub-canopy structure is less well developed. Sub-canopy structure consists of suppressed mature trees, regenerating tree saplings, shrubs, herbs, snags and coarse-woody-debris. With the increasing density of ALS point clouds, new opportunities exist to describe these sub-canopy structural components in forests that were previously difficult to detect using passive remote sensing technologies. In this research we use discrete return ALS data acquired at a density of 23 points x m(2) to estimate sub-canopy forest structure for 48,000 ha of conifer dominated forest in central British Columbia, Canada. We first segmented the forest vertical structure into canopy and sub-canopy based on Lorey's mean height (HL). HL, which favours larger trees as a baseline for canopy height, provides separation between the taller trees that dominate the canopy and smaller trees that represent the sub-canopy. We defined sub-canopy trees as those < 70% of HL. Both ground-truthed forest inventory data and the ALS point cloud were then segmented into canopy and sub-canopy components. A mixture of standard height-based and density-based ALS metrics were then computed to develop predictive models of sub-canopy component of the stands. Models were calibrated with 28 ground plots and developed using stepwise regression with the strongest predictors being a combination of height, structure and cover-based metrics. Two model sets were developed, one for the entire point cloud, and another for an isolated sub-canopy point cloud defined by HL. The isolated sub-canopy set of models resulted in stronger cross-validated R-squared values of 0.88, 0.68, and 0.55 for tree volume, basal area and number of sub-canopy trees, respectively. We then applied these models over the entire study area to characterize the sub-canopy structure, resulting inventory can be used by land managers for a number of purposes including selecting candidate locations for selective logging to preserve mid-term timber opportunities, fire susceptibility and carbon sequestration modelling, and wildlife habitat values.

AB Remote sensing images contain abundant land cover information. Due to the complex nature of land cover, however, mixed pixels exist widely in remote sensing images. Sub-pixel mapping (SPM) is a technique for predicting the spatial distribution of land cover classes within mixed pixels. As an ill-posed inverse problem, the uncertainty of prediction cannot be eliminated and hinders the production of accurate sub-pixel maps. In contrast to conventional methods that use continuous geospatial information (e.g., images) to enhance SPM, in this paper, a SPM method with point constraints into SPM is proposed. The method of fusing point constraints is implemented based on the pixel swapping algorithm (PSA) and utilizes the auxiliary point information to reduce the uncertainty in the SPM process and increase map accuracy. The point data are incorporated into both the initialization and optimization processes of PSA. Experiments were performed on three images to validate the proposed method. The influences of the performances were also investigated under different numbers of point data, different spatial characters of land cover and different zoom factors. The results show that by using the point data, the proposed SPM method can separate more small-sized targets from aggregated artifacts and the accuracies are increased obviously. The proposed method is also more accurate than the advanced radial basis function interpolation-based method. The advantage of using point data is more evident when the point data size and scale factor are large and the spatial autocorrelation of the land cover is small. As the amount of point data increases, however, the increase in accuracy becomes less noticeable. Furthermore, the SPM accuracy can still be increased even if the point data and coarse proportions contain errors.

AB A wavelet based method for bathymetry retrieval from X-band radar images is proposed. The method combines traditional Fast Fourier Transform techniques for retrieving peak frequency maps by evaluating the spectral peaks in the time domain, and a localized 2D Continuous Wavelet Transform for retrieving the corresponding peak wavenumbers. The main improvements of the new method compared to conventional FFT-based methods are as follows: a) the wavelet-based approach is localized - naturally fitting the inhomogeneous conditions typically found in the nearshore environment; b) it is continuous and uses wave phase information providing smooth bathymetry maps with good accuracy (RMSE in the range 2.6-6.6% of the maximum water depth); c) it requires relatively small number of successive images without the limitation of requiring a uniform time step.
   In order to verify the proposed method, 2D simulations of wave shoaling and refraction were performed for different sea conditions and over several bottom topographies. A radar image model including tilt and shadowing modulations together with speckle noise was applied to the simulated surface elevations to provide synthetic radar images. The method's ability to reconstruct the original bathymetry is shown to be robust in intermediate to shallow water depths (k(p)h < 1) for all cases. The method was also applied to real data acquired in Sylt island (Germany). A comparison between a bathymetric survey held prior to a storm and a radar reconstructed one during the storm shows very good agreement. These results reassure the high capability of this new method to be used in operational settings.

AB The Ocean and Sea-Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF) of the EUropean Organisation for the Exploitation of METeorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) has performed a reprocessing of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) archive (2004-2012).
   The retrieval method consists of a non-linear split-window algorithm and an algorithm correction relying on simulations of infrared brightness temperatures performed using atmospheric profiles of water vapour and temperature from a Numerical Weather Prediction model, and a radiative transfer model. The cloud mask used is the Climate SAF reprocessing of the MSG/SEVIRI archive which is consistent over the period considered. Atmospheric Saharan dust has a strong impact on the retrieved SST in the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions, they are taken into consideration through the computation of the Saharan Dust Index (SDI) which is then used to determine an empirical correction applied to SST.
   The reprocessing has benefited from the experience of the OSI SAF team in operational near real time processing of MSG/SEVIRI data, and the methods have been improved to provide a higher quality SST. The MSG/SEVIRI SST reprocessing dataset consists of hourly level 3 composites of sub-skin temperature projected onto a regular 0.05 degrees grid over the region delimited by 60N,60S and 60W,60E. It has been thoroughly validated against drifting buoys and moored buoys measurements.
   Results of this validation have shown that the reprocessed data record is of significantly better quality than the OSI SAF operational processing (for instance the day-time robust standard deviation is 0.45 K for the operational processing and 0.35 K for the reprocessed dataset). The data record has been used to characterize the diurnal variability of SST over large temporal and spatial scales.

AB Wildfire disturbances effect changes in vegetation communities that in turn influence climate. Such changes in boreal forest ecosystems can persist over decadal time scales or longer. In the ecotone between boreal forest and steppe in the region southeast of Lake Baikal in southern Siberia, shifts between the two vegetation types may be precipitated by variations in site specific conditions, as well as disturbance characteristics such as fire frequency and severity. Warmer, drier conditions in the region have been associated with a decrease in fire return intervals and greater burn severity that may, in turn, drive conversion of forests to steppe vegetation at a greater rate than has occurred prior to the onset of warming and drying. Stand-replacing fires in Pinus sylvestris stands in southern Siberia may lead to recruitment failure postfire, particularly on southwest to west-facing slopes, which are more often dominated by grasses. This study uses a combination of field data and remotely sensed indices of vegetation and moisture to distinguish between recruitment pathways in southern Siberia, and to study the influence of factors related to soils, topography, fire severity and winter snow cover on these.
   We expected that recruitment success would be associated with lower burn severity (higher NBR), higher greenness (NDVI) and moisture (NDMI), and winter snow (NDSI) postfire. We also expected phenological characteristics to differ among recruitment paths. Prior to burning, our sites are broadly similar in terms of remotely sensed indices of moisture (NDMI), vegetation (NDVI), and winter fractional snow cover (NDSI), but recruitment failure sites are generally drier and less green postfire. Initial differences in greenness and moisture among sites characterized by abundant recruitment (AR), intermediate recruitment (IR) and recruitment failure (RF) become more pronounced over the initial decades postfire. The earliest separability of AR and RF sites using remotely sensed indices occurs in the winter months 3-4 years postfire, during which time NDSI is highest for AR sites and lowest for RF. Although seasonality was important with regard to distinguishing among AR, IR and RF index values, the timing of phenological events such as start and end of season did not differ significantly among the sites.

AB Leaf chlorophyll is central to the exchange of carbon, water and energy between the biosphere and the atmosphere, and to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. This paper presents the first spatially-continuous view of terrestrial leaf chlorophyll content (Chl(Leaf)) at the global scale. Weekly maps of Chl(Leaf) were produced from ENVISAT MERIS full resolution (300 m) satellite data using a two-stage physically-based radiative transfer modelling approach. Firstly, leaf-level reflectance was derived from top-of-canopy satellite reflectance observations using 4-Scale and SAIL canopy radiative transfer models for woody and non-woody vegetation, respectively. Secondly, the modelled leaf-level reflectance was input into the PROSPECT leaf-level radiative transfer model to derive Chl(Leaf). The Chl(Leaf) retrieval algorithm was validated using measured Chi(Leaf) data from 248 sample measurements at 28 field locations, and covering six plant functional types (PFTs). Modelled results show strong relationships with field measurements, particularly for deciduous broadleaf forests (R-2 = 0.67; RMSE = 9.25 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001), croplands (R-2 = 0.41; RMSE = 13.18 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001) and evergreen needleleaf forests (R-2 = 0.47; RMSE = 10.63 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001). When the modelled results from all PFTs were considered together, the overall relationship with measured Chl(Leaf )remained good (R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 10.79 mu g cm(-2); p < 0.001). This result is an improvement on the relationship between measured Chl(Leaf) and a commonly used chlorophyll-sensitive spectral vegetation index; the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI; R-2 = 0.27, p < 0.001). The global maps show large temporal and spatial variability in Chl(Leaf), with evergreen broadleaf forests presenting the highest leaf chlorophyll values, with global annual median values of 54.4 mu g cm(-2). Distinct seasonal Chl(Leaf) phenologies are also visible, particularly in deciduous plant forms, associated with budburst and crop growth, and leaf senescence. It is anticipated that this global Chl(Leaf) product will make an important step towards the explicit consideration of leaf-level biochemistry in terrestrial water, energy and carbon cycle modelling.

AB Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an operational tool for monitoring and assessment of oil spills. Satellite SAR has primarily been used to detect the presence/absence of oil, yet its ability to discriminate oil emulsions within a detected oil slick has not been fully exploited. Additionally, one of the challenges in the past has been the ability to deliver strategic information derived from satellite remote sensing in a timely fashion to responders in the field. This study presents methods for the rapid classification of oil types and estimated thicknesses, from which information about thick oil and oil emulsions (i.e., "actionable" oil) can be delivered in an operational timeframe to responders in the field. Experiments carried out at the OHMSETT test facility in New Jersey demonstrate that under specific viewing conditions, a single polarization satellite SAR image can record a signal variance between thick stable emulsions and non-emulsified oil. During a series of field campaigns in the Gulf of Mexico with in situ measurements of oil thickness, multiple satellite data were obtained including fully polarimetric C-band SAR imagery from RADARSAT-2 and multispectral imagery from ASTER and WorldView-2. One campaign included the airborne polarimetric UAVSAR L-band sensor. An oil/emulsion thickness classification product was generated based on RADARSAT-2 polarimetric imagery using entropy and the damping ratio derivations. Herein, we present the classification methods to generate oil thickness products from SAR, validated by sea-truth observations, the multispectral imagery, and the UAVSAR data. We tested the ability to deliver these products with minimum latency to responding vessels via NOAA. During field operations in the Gulf of Mexico, a satellite SAR-based product of oil delineation by relative thickness was delivered to a responding vessel 42 min after the RADARSAT-2 data acquisition. This proof-of-concept test using satellite SAR and multispectral imagery to detect emulsions and deliver a derived information product to a vessel in near-real-time points directly to methods for satellite-based assets to be used in the near future for oil spill tactical response operations.

AB A variety of prototypical metrics of ICESat-1 GLAS full-waveform data have been applied to estimate the forest canopy height over a footprint area and presented using the values of maximum canopy height, crown-areaweighted canopy height, or basal-area-weighted canopy height. The full-waveform pattern of a large footprint is changeable due to complicated interaction of canopy elements and terrain relief, consequently a noticeable bias may be introduced to the estimation. This paper begins with the approach of area-based growing stock volume calculation, developing harmonized metrics to integrate versatile signals in a denoised multimodal waveform of ICESat-1 data. These novel metrics were applied to derive a harmonized canopy height model for estimating the canopy height at footprint level and the distribution of canopy height at stand level. The performance of this model was evaluated with respect to the prototypical metrics derived canopy height model based on airborne LiDAR data determined canopy heights of a secondary evergreen mixed forest in a steep rugged terrain in central Taiwan. Footprint-level canopy height was evaluated via accuracy measures using a cross-validation method. Appropriateness of canopy height structure was examined via a post hoc test of the shape similarity for both ICESat-1 data-derived and airborne LiDAR-derived canopy height distribution models at stand level. Results showed that the harmonized canopy height model was able to achieve an accuracy of RMSE = 3.13 +/- 0.08 m and RMSE% = 22.40 +/- 0.55% as well as a significant reduction of bias. The canopy height distribution of the forest stand derived by harmonized metrics of ICESat-1 full-waveform data is statistically the same as that determined by airborne LiDAR data. Harmonized metrics provide compensatory information of trailing-edge extent and terrain index for describing canopy height. In contrast to the canopy height model using only prototypical waveform metrics, the harmonized metrics based canopy height model can mitigate the potential influence of terrain effects and dense canopy coverage on waveform pattern. Because a priori knowledge of terrain relief data is not required for modeling, the harmonized algorithm is useful for retrieving the trend of canopy height growth over the terrestrial forest ecosystem.

AB Satellite derived bathymetry (SDB) enables rapid mapping of large coastal areas through measurement of optical penetration of the water column. The resolution of bathymetric mapping and achievable horizontal and vertical accuracies vary but generally, all SDB outputs are constrained by sensor type, water quality and other environmental conditions. Efforts to improve accuracy include physics-based methods (similar to radiative transfer models e.g. for atmospheric/vegetation studies) or detailed in-situ sampling of the seabed and water column, but the spatial component of SDB measurements is often under-utilised in SDB workflows despite promising results suggesting potential to improve accuracy significantly. In this study, a selection of satellite datasets (Landsat 8, RapidEye and Pleiades) at different spatial and spectral resolutions were tested using a log ratio transform to derive bathymetry in an Atlantic coastal embayment. A series of non-spatial and spatial linear analyses were then conducted and their influence on SDB prediction accuracy was assessed in addition to the significance of each model's parameters. Landsat 8 (30 m pixel size) performed relatively weak with the non-spatial model, but showed the best results with the spatial model. However, the highest spatial resolution imagery used Pleiades (2 m pixel size) showed good results across both non-spatial and spatial models which suggests a suitability for SDB prediction at a higher spatial resolution than the others. In all cases, the spatial models were able to constrain the prediction differences at increased water depths.

AB Snow depth estimation derived from high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) can lead to improved understanding of the spatially highly heterogeneous nature of snow distribution, as well as help us improve our knowledge of how snow patterns influence local geomorphic processes. Slope deformation processes such as permafrost creep can make it challenging to acquire a snow-free DEM that matches the sub-snow topography at the time of the associated snow-covered DEM, which can cause errors in the computed snow depths. In this study, we illustrate how modelling changes in the sub-snow topography can reduce errors in snow depths derived from DEM differencing in an area of permafrost creep. To model the sub-snow topography, a surface deformation model was constructed by performing non-rigid registration based on B-splines of two snow-free DEMs. Seasonal variations in creep were accounted for by using an optimization approach to find a suitable value to scale the deformation model based on in-situ snow depth measurements or the presence of snow-free areas corresponding to the date of the snow-covered DEM. This scaled deformation model was used to transform one of the snow-free DEMs to estimate the sub-snow topography corresponding to the date of the snow-covered DEM. The performance of this method was tested on an active rock glacier in the southern French Alps for two surveys dates, which were conducted in the winter and spring of 2017.
   By accounting for surface displacements caused by permafrost creep, we found that our method was able to reduce the errors in the estimated snow depths by up to 33% (an interquartile range reduction of 11 cm) compared to using the untransformed snow-free DEM. The accuracy of the snow depths only slightly improved (root-mean-square error decrease of up to 3 cm). Greater reductions in error were observed for the snow depths calculated for the date that was furthest (i.e., the winter survey) in time from the snow-free DEM. Additionally, we found that our approach to scaling the deformation model has promising potential to be adapted for monitoring seasonal variations in permafrost creep by combining in-situ snow depth measurements with high-resolution surface deformation models.

AB Remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a rapidly advancing front in terrestrial vegetation science, with emerging capability in space-based methodologies and diverse application prospects. Although remote sensing of SIF especially from space is seen as a contemporary new specialty for terrestrial plants, it is founded upon a multi-decadal history of research, applications, and sensor developments in active and passive sensing of chlorophyll fluorescence. Current technical capabilities allow SIF to be measured across a range of biological, spatial, and temporal scales. As an optical signal, SIF may be assessed remotely using high-resolution spectral sensors in tandem with state-of-the-art algorithms to distinguish the emission from reflected and/or scattered ambient light. Because the red to far-red SIF emission is detectable non-invasively, it may be sampled repeatedly to acquire spatio-temporally explicit information about photosynthetic light responses and steady-state behaviour in vegetation. Progress in this field is accelerating with innovative sensor developments, retrieval methods, and modelling advances. This review distills the historical and current developments spanning the last several decades. It highlights SIF heritage and complementarity within the broader field of fluorescence science, the maturation of physiological and radiative transfer modelling, SIF signal retrieval strategies, techniques for field and airborne sensing, advances in satellite-based systems, and applications of these capabilities in evaluation of photosynthesis and stress effects. Progress, challenges, and future directions are considered for this unique avenue of remote sensing.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in many research fields. Many algorithms have been developed to retrieve LST from satellite thermal infrared (TIR) measurements; of these, the most widely used are the split window (SW) and temperature emissivity separation (TES) methods. However, the performance of the SW and TES methods can be limited by the difficulty in obtaining sufficiently accurate prior knowledge-specifically, input land surface emissivity (LSE) for the SW method and atmospheric parameters for the TES method. In this study, a procedure was proposed for selecting specific channel pairs in the TIR spectral region to accurately retrieve ground brightness temperatures without prior atmospheric knowledge, using a method similar to the SW method. Subsequently, the TES method is applied to the retrieved ground brightness temperatures to separate the LST and LSE. In numerical simulations, the three ground brightness temperatures corresponding to 8.6 mu m, 9.0 mu m, and 10.4 mu m are acquired with an accuracy of about 0.65 K by using five channels centered at 8.6 mu m, 9.0 mu m, 10.4 mu m, 11.3 mu m, and 12.5 mu m, each with a width of 0.1 mu m. When inputting the three retrieved ground brightness temperatures into TES method, LST could be recovered with an accuracy of 0.87 K. Sensitivity analysis shows that LST retrieval accuracy is less affected by channel width and atmospheric downwelling radiance than by the channel center locations and channel noise. Finally, the proposed method is preliminarily applied to actual satellite data from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and the retrieved results are compared with the pixel-aggregated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product. For the study area of Australia, discrepancies between our result and the MODIS LST product appear to be about 1.6 K during the day and 1.0 K at night, indicating that the new channel configuration can be used to retrieve accurate LST from satellite measurements.

AB Estimating regional evapotranspiration (ET) is challenging in data-limited regions where a lack of in situ observations constrain model calibration and implementation. Here we developed an ensemble mean surface energy balance (EnSEB) modeling framework that is independent of any ground calibration and applied it in India to understand the magnitude and variability of ET in this agriculturally important region. EnSEB uses daily land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation biophysical inputs from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and climatic information from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Modem-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (Merra-2) products and runs seven surface energy balance (SEB) algorithms to estimate ensemble mean ET or latent heat (LE) fluxes at a spatial resolution of 1 km x 1 km. Due to limited access to observed flux data, we conducted three different types of model evaluation: i) instantaneous LE validation using observed SEB fluxes from Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) measurements in four agroecosystems, ii) annual and seasonal ET comparison with six global products at the regional scale, and iii) by closing the basin-scale monthly water budget (WB) for five large river basins (87,900-312,812 km(2)) in India. Validation with the BREB measurements revealed hourly EnSEB LE estimates to be within 2% of the observed LE (R-2 = 0.57 and RMSE = 59 W m(-2)) and EnSEB was more accurate than any of the individual SEB models. Annual ET from EnSEB was positively correlated with six widely-used global ET products (r = 0.52-0.83, p-value < 0.001), but EnSEB captured the magnitude of ET in intensively irrigated regions much better. Basin-scale monthly WB miscloures were found to be between -1 and 9 mm month(-1) from EnSEB ET estimates, which were better than those from the six global ET products. The gap filling method based on the constant ETrF (ET/reference ET) approach introduced some uncertainties in EnSEB, which presents room for future improvements. Overall, our results suggest that the automated and calibration free multi-model EnSEB framework, which uses only remote sensing and readily available reanalysis data, has the ability to estimate ET with reliable accuracy in Indian agroecosystems. Such a framework could help us better understand and monitor the water cycle in regions where ground data are limited or non-existent.

AB Accurate measurements of maize yields at field or subfield scales are useful for guiding agronomic practices and investments and policies for improving food security. Data on smallholder maize systems are currently sparse, but satellite remote sensing offers promise for accelerating learning about these systems. Here we document the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) to build "wall-to-wall" 10 m resolution maps of (i) cropland presence, (ii) maize presence, and (iii) maize yields for the main 2017 maize season in Kenya and Tanzania. Mapping these outcomes at this scale is extremely challenging because of very heterogeneous landscapes, lack of cloud-free satellite imagery, and the low quantity of quality ground-based data in these regions.
   First, we computed seasonal median composites of Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 optical reflectance measures for each pixel in the region, and used them to build both crop/non-crop and maize/nonmaize Random Forest (RF) classifiers. Several thousand crop/non-crop labels were collected through an in-house GEE labeler, and thousands of crop type labels from the 2015-2017 growing seasons were obtained from various sources. Results show that the crop/non-crop classifier successfully identified cropland with over 85% out-of sample accuracy in both countries, with Sentinel-1 being particularly useful for prediction. Among the cropped pixels, the maize/non-maize classier had an accuracy of 79% in Tanzania and 63% in Kenya.
   To map maize yields, we build on past work using a scalable crop yield mapper (SCYM) that utilizes simulations from a crop model to train a regression that predicts yields from observations. Here we advance past approaches by (i) grouping simulations by Global Agro-Environmental Stratification (GAES) zones across the two countries, in order to account for landscape heterogeneity, (ii) utilizing gridded datasets on soil and sowing and harvest dates to setup model simulations in a scalable way; and (iii) utilizing all available satellite observations during the growing season in a parsimonious way by using harmonic regression fits implemented in GEE. SCYM estimates were able to capture about 50% of the variation in the yields at the district level in Western Kenya as measured by objective ground-based crop cuts.
   Finally, we illustrated the utility of our yield maps with two case studies. First, we document the magnitude and interannual variability of spatial heterogeneity of yields in each district, and how it varies for different parts of the region. Second, we combine our estimates with recently released soil databases in the region to investigate the most important soil constraints in the region. Soil factors explain a high fraction (72%) of variation in predicted yields, with the predominant factor being soil nitrogen levels. Overall, this study illustrates the power of combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, the GEE platform, and advanced classification and yield mapping algorithms to advance understanding of smallholder agricultural systems.

AB A new multilayer (ML) cloud detection algorithm based on three shortwave infrared (SWIR) and two longwave infrared (LWIR) channels is developed and applied to the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi-NPP satellite. The algorithm identifies ML clouds, i.e., ice clouds overlying water clouds, based on satellite multispectral observations in the 1.38, 1.6, 2.25, 8.5, and 11 pm channels. We perform synthetic radiative transfer simulations to understand the sensitivities of the aforementioned channels on ML and single-layer (SL) clouds. Active CALIOP observations are used to evaluate the algorithm. Compared with the collocated CALIOP results, the algorithm can determine SL and ML clouds correctly with success rates of approximately 80% and 60%, respectively, and has similar performance to that of the current MODIS operational ML cloud detection algorithm. The misclassification of ML clouds as SL clouds is primarily caused by thin ice clouds that are practically undetectable using LWIR tests. Furthermore, the algorithm is extended to analyze data from radiometers onboard the geostationary Himawari-8 and FengYun-4A satellites, and results similar to those of VIIRS are obtained.

AB A network of High-Frequency radar (HFR) stations runs operationally in the Malta-Sicily Channel (MSC), Central Mediterranean Sea, providing sea surface current maps with high temporal (1 h) and spatial (3 x 3 km) resolutions since August 2012. Comparisons with surface drifter data and near-surface Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) observations, as well as radar site-to-site baseline analyses, provide quantitative assessments of HFR velocities accuracy. Twenty-two drifters were deployed within the HFR domain of coverage between December 2012 and October 2013. Additionally, six ADCP vertical current profiles were collected at selected positions during a dedicated field survey. External radio-frequency interferences lead to significant gaps in the HFR coverage, which were minimized by an interpolation technique applied to the surface current fields. The validation of HFR velocities was first performed for each individual station in the network, using data generated with both the ideal and the measured antenna patterns. The validation was then repeated with pairs of HFR stations using the site-to-site baseline error analysis. The analysis confirms that the baseline error estimations and the full validation metrics for this HFR frequency band are consistent, and in some aspects superior, when compared to results from similar studies in other regions. The validation with drifter tracks suggests that the adopted interpolation procedure does not in general impact on the comparison metrics, but may introduce biases when used to extrapolate currents in regions where radar geometrical constraints are suboptimal. The analysis of the percentage of contribution of individual HFR stations shown that the quality of HFR data is influenced by the network geometry.

AB Semi-analytical algorithms (SAAs) developed for multispectral ocean color sensors have benefited from a variety of approaches for retrieving the magnitude and spectral shape of inherent optical properties (IOPs). SAAs generally follow two approaches: 1) simultaneous retrieval of all IOPs, resulting in pre-defined bio-optical models and spectral dependence between IOPs and 2) retrieval of bulk IOPs (absorption and backscattering) first followed by decomposition into separate components, allowing for independent retrievals of some components. Current algorithms used to decompose hyperspectral remotely-sensed reflectance into IOPs follow the first strategy. Here, a spectral deconvolution algorithm for incorporation into the second strategy is presented that decomposes a(t-w)(lambda) from in situ measurements and estimates absorption due to phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)) and colored detrital material (a(dg)(lambda)) free of explicit assumptions. The algorithm described here, Derivative Analysis and Iterative Spectral Evaluation of Absorption (DAISEA), provides estimates of a(ph)(lambda) and a(dg)(lambda) over a spectral range from 350 to 700 nm. Estimated a(ph)(lambda) and a(dg)(lambda) showed an average normalized root mean square difference of < 30% and < 20%, respectively, from 350 to 650 nm for the majority of optically distinct environments considered. Estimated S-dg median difference was < 20% for all environments considered, while distribution of S-dg uncertainty suggests that biogeochemical variability represented by S-dg can be estimated free of bias. DAISEA results suggest that hyperspectral satellite ocean color data will improve our ability to track biogeochemical processes affiliated with variability in a(dg)(lambda) and S-dg free of explicit assumptions.

AB The true color composite is a widely used Earth observation product for displaying satellite imagery. As it is often used in communication with non-expert audiences in various media, it is desirable that such a product approximates the color perceived by the human eye. Additionally, as the Sentinel-2 mission with its high resolution multispectral imagery and short revisit times is delivering unprecedented amounts of data, any algorithm for computing the composite should be efficient. In this paper we define the natural color product, propose two efficient approaches for computing it, analyze the results, and implement the products on a satellite imagery service for interactive use. Our algorithms work on a per-pixel basis and hence parallelize naturally. The presented approaches are general and not limited to Sentinel-2 data.

AB In this study, we examined the ASCAT backscatter data from Metop-A from 2007 to 2016 to characterize spatial and temporal variability in the vegetation parameters of the TU Wien Soil Moisture Retrieval approach (TUW SMR) across the North American Grasslands. The vegetation parameters are the slope and curvature of a second order Taylor polynomial used to describe the incidence angle dependence of backscatter sigma degrees. A recent development allows the vegetation parameters to be determined dynamically using the local slope values within a prescribed temporal window. Seasonal, interannual and diurnal variations in the vegetation parameters were found to vary across grassland cover types, reflecting variations in soil moisture availability and growing season length. While the slope has always been considered a measure of vegetation density, our results show that curvature also contains information about vegetation. Drought events in 2011 and 2012 resulted in extensive negative sigma(40)degrees and soil moisture anomalies during the maximum biomass period. Contiguous anomalies in slope and curvature were observed where the severity and persistence of the drought were enough to impact vegetation. Observed diurnal differences in slope and curvature suggest that daily moisture transport within the vegetation influences the relative dominance of scattering from the vegetation and soil surface.

AB Bush encroachment is a highly relevant environmental issue in South African savannas, influencing ecological processes as well as the grazing capacity of the land. However the drivers of bush encroachment are not yet fully revealed which can partly be attributed to the problem that large-scale data of woody vegetation cover are missing. Using a multi-scale and a multi-sensor approach, this study aimed at providing the status of woody vegetation cover for the Molopo Area in South Africa. Training data for woody vegetation was derived from unsupervised classification of high-resolution aerial image tiles. To derive spatially continuous estimates of fractional woody cover for the entire Molopo Area, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data were applied in a machine learning based modelling approach. Therefore, a database of training samples was generated by aggregating the classified aerial image tiles to the geometry of the Sentinel data. A Random Forest algorithm with a forward feature variable selection was then trained to relate the spectral and radar information to fractional woody cover. The model was applied to make spatial predictions of fractional woody cover at 10 m resolution for the entire Molopo Area for the year 2016. Spatial cross-validation revealed a prediction error in fractional cover of 12%. The derived model and cover data show the potential for upcoming time series analysis of Sentinel-based woody cover estimates which can serve as a basis to bring new insights into the drivers of bush encroachment.

AB Time series analysis of Landsat data is widely used for assessing forest change at the large-area scale. Various change detection algorithms have been proposed, each employing different techniques to characterise abrupt disturbance events and longer term trends. However, results can vary significantly, depending on the algorithm, parameters and the spectral index (or indices) chosen. This mismatch in results has led to researchers hypothesizing that an ensemble based approach may increase accuracy. In this study we assess two change detection algorithms (LandTrendr and the R package strucchange), each with three indices (the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index or NDVI, the Normalized Burn Ratio or NBR, and Tasseled Cap Wetness or TCW). We test their ability to detect abrupt disturbances in sclerophyll forests over a 29 year time period, and subsequently evaluate a number of ensembles, using simple fusion rules and Random Forests models. A total of 4087 manually interpreted reference pixels, sampled from 9 million ha of forest, were used for training and validation. In addition, we assess the effects of priming the Random Forests classifier with confusing cases (commission errors from the time series algorithms). Our results clearly show that ensembles combining multiple change detection techniques out-perform any one method. Our most accurate Random Forests model, using an ensemble of all 6 algorithm outputs, along with 3 bi-temporal change rasters (change in NBR, NDVI and TCW), had an overall error rate of 7%, compared with the most accurate single algorithm/index approach (LandTrendr with NBR), which had an overall error of 21%. Our findings also indicate that acceptable results (14% error) can be achieved without the use of traditional change detection algorithms, by using robust reference data and Random Forests classification. However, by priming the classifier with confusing cases informed by the change detection algorithms, commission errors decreased substantially, at the expense of slight increases in omission errors. In fact, a Random Forests ensemble, using the primed training data and only 3 bi-temporal change rasters, was more accurate than any one individual algorithm, with an overall error of 11%. By including some additional metrics derived from Landsat time series (e.g. 2 year changes and overall means) this error was further reduced to 8%. Given that most change detection algorithms have large processing requirements, this suggests that algorithms can be applied to a sample of pixels only, for the sole purpose of training a machine learning classifier. We demonstrate the feasibility of this previously unexplored approach, by creating annual disturbance maps over a large area of forest (9 million ha) and long time period (29 years).

AB The Taiwan Strait is the only channel connecting the South China Sea (SCS) and the East China Sea (ECS), and plays a key role in the material exchanges between SCS and ECS. The region however is poorly sampled during the northeast (NE) monsoon when severe weather hinders shipboard measurements. In this study, the surface circulations in the Taiwan Strait and the adjacent East China Sea are derived from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) with a high spatiotemporal resolution. The satellite observations are limited by cloud over. Nevertheless, they provide the only surface flow observations useful in hypothesis testing. It is demonstrated that the transient surface currents can be classified into three regimes: a southwestward flow for strong winds, a northeastward flow for weak winds, and a cross-strait flow for moderate winds. The satellite observations are also valuable in validating model currents. Two high-resolution global ocean reanalysis products, the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) and the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS), are examined. The reanalysis products are generally consistent with the satellite observations. The CMEMS moreover shows a superior performance. This study illustrates the unique capability of the geostationary ocean color satellite in providing spatially extensive surface flow observations in broad shelf regions where current meter data are sparse or non-existent.

AB For food crises early warning purposes, coarse spatial resolution NDVI data are widely used to monitor vegetation conditions in near real-time (NRT). Different types of NDVI anomalies are typically employed to assess the current state of crops and rangelands as compared to previous years. Timeliness and accuracy of such anomalies are critical factors to an effective monitoring. Temporal smoothing can efficiently reduce noise and cloud contamination in the time series of historical observations, where data points are available before and after each observation to be smoothed. With NRT data, smoothing methods are adapted to cope with the unbalanced availability of data before and after the most recent data points. These NRT approaches provide successive updates of the estimation of the same data point as more observations become available. Anomalies compare the current NDVI value with some statistics (e.g. indicators of central tendency and dispersion) extracted from the historical archive of observations. With multiple updates of the same datasets being available, two options can be selected to compute anomalies, i.e. using the same update level for the NRT data and the statistics or using the most reliable update for the latter. In this study we assess the accuracy of three commonly employed 1 km MODIS NDVI anomalies (standard scores, non-exceedance probability and vegetation condition index) with respect to (1) delay with which they become available and (2) option selected for their computation. We show that a large estimation error affects the earlier estimates and that this error is efficiently reduced in subsequent updates. In addition, with regards to the preferable option to compute anomalies, we empirically observe that it depends on the type of application (e.g. averaging anomalies value over an area of interest vs. detecting "drought" conditions by setting a threshold on the anomaly value) and the employed anomaly type. Finally, we map the spatial pattern in the magnitude of NRT anomaly estimation errors over the globe and relate it to average cloudiness.

AB Estimation of turbulent heat fluxes by assimilating sequences of land surface temperature (LST) measurements into variational data assimilation (VDA) frameworks has been the subject of several studies. The VDA approaches estimate turbulent heat fluxes by minimizing the difference between LST observations and estimations from the heat diffusion equation. The VDA methods have been tested only with high temporal resolution LST observations (e.g., from geostationary satellites) when applied at regional scales. Geostationary satellites can capture the diurnal cycle of LST, but they have a relatively low spatial resolution and mainly focus on low latitudes. To overcome these shortcomings, this study assimilates high spatial resolution LST data from polar orbiting satellites (e.g., Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, MODIS) into the combined-source (CS) and dual-source (DS) VDA schemes. An expression is developed to obtain an a priori evaporative fraction (EF) estimate from leaf area index (LAI) or apparent thermal inertia (ATI). The a priori EF estimate is used as an initial guess in the VDA approach. The results indicate that the VDA method is able to find the optimal value of EF by assimilating the low-temporal resolution MODIS LST data. The predicted turbulent heat fluxes from VDA are compared with the measurements from the large-aperture scintillometer at three sites (Arou, Daman, and Sidaoqiao) in the Heihe River Basin (located in northwest China). The findings indicate that the CS and DS VDA models perform well in various hydrological and vegetative conditions. The three-site-average root mean square errors (RMSEs) of sensible and latent heat fluxes estimates from the CS scheme are 37.44 W m(-2) and 94.30 W m(-2), respectively. The DS model reduces the above mentioned RMSEs by 19.82% and 21.37%, respectively. Overall, the results show that using the a priori EF estimate from the proposed expression in the VDA approach eliminates the need for the high resolution LST data from geostationary satellites, and allows the VDA method to estimate turbulent heat fluxes by assimilating LST data from polar orbiting satellites. Finally, several numerical tests are conducted to assess the effect of LST temporal sampling on the turbulent heat fluxes estimates. The results show that the LST measurement at 1400 Local Time (LT) has the most amount of information for partitioning the available energy into sensible and latent heat fluxes.

AB Global food security is negatively affected by drought. Climate projections show that drought frequency and intensity may increase in different parts of the globe. These increases are particularly hazardous for developing countries. Early season forecasts on drought occurrence and severity could help to better mitigate the negative consequences of drought. The objective of this study was to assess if interannual variability in agricultural productivity in Chile can be accurately predicted from freely-available, near real-time data sources. As the response variable, we used the standard score of seasonal cumulative NDVI (zcNDVI), based on 2000-2017 data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), as a proxy for anomalies of seasonal primary productivity. The predictions were performed with forecast lead times from one- to six-month before the end of the growing season, which varied between census units in Chile. Predictor variables included the zcNDVI obtained by cumulating NDVI from season start up to prediction time; standardised precipitation indices derived from satellite rainfall estimates, for time-scales of 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months; the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Multivariate ENSO oscillation indices; the length of the growing season, and latitude and longitude. For each of the 758 census units considered, the time series of the response and the predictor variables were averaged for agricultural areas resulting in a 17-season time series per unit for each variable. We used two prediction approaches: (i) optimal linear regression (OLR) whereby for each census unit the single predictor was selected that best explained the interannual zcNDVI variability, and (ii) a multi-layer feedforward neural network architecture, often called deep learning (DL), where all predictors for all units were combined in a single spatio-temporal model. Both approaches were evaluated with a leave-one-year-out cross-validation procedure. Both methods showed good prediction accuracies for small lead times and similar values for all lead times. The mean R-cv(2) values for OLR were 0.95, 0.83, 0.68, 0.56, 0.46 and 0.37, against 0.96, 0.84, 0.65, 0.54, 0.46 and 0.38 for DL, for one, two, three, four, five, and six months lead time, respectively. Given the wide range of climates and vegetation types covered within the study area, we expect that the presented models can contribute to an improved early warning system for agricultural drought in different geographical settings around the globe.

AB Ensuring food security has been the top priority of many regions, particularly in developing countries in Africa. In recent decades, increasing population, together with growing food demands, have put great pressure on the world's food production. Long-term, up-to-date, annual cropland mapping at high resolution (i.e., at tens-of-metre levels) is in urgent demand for tracking spatial and temporal patterns of cropland change. However, because of the difficulty of capturing seasonality and flexible cropping systems, few studies have focused on understanding the dynamics of cropland using Landsat data in Africa. Here, we propose a new method of updating annual cropland mapping using a change-detection approach and post-classification to improve on traditional bi-temporal change vector analysis. Three Landsat footprints in Africa were selected (Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa) as our study areas based on their different cropping systems and field sizes. The potential annual change areas were detected by employing multiple indices and thresholds in reference and long-term annual composite Landsat images. Next, map updates were conducted in the potential change pixels using random forest-based classification. Different training sample metrics were used (seasonal and annual samples) and compared in the classification step. The long-term cropland mapping accuracies for these three sites ranged from 88.04% to 94.30% (Egypt), 76.28% to 82.88% (Ethiopia) and 56.52% to 67.53% (South Africa). The results showed improvements in the accuracy and consistency of updating the annual cropland information using change-detection approaches, accounting for accuracy increases of 2.40%, 10.62% and 0.55% compared with a yearly cropland mapping approach in our previous research. The best results using annual samples extracted from the same season with the classified images supported the use of annual and growing samples in long-term annual mapping. Overall, a common trend of cropland expansion in all three sites was revealed, with an increase rate of 10.06, 3.73 and 1.35 kha/year in Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa, respectively. The results indicated a rapid increasing pattern from bare land (desert) to irrigated systems (Egyptian site) but smaller and stable cropland changes in smallholder and farming-pastoral ecotones (Ethiopian and South African site), where limited land was still available for an expansion of agricultural area. This study highlights the potential application of time-series Landsat data in documenting and contributing missing cropland distribution information required for assessing and solving food security in Africa.

AB Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a tool that can be used to monitor canopy height changes when data acquisitions are done at successive times. However, ALS is subject to some limitations in forested environments. One of these is that height growth measured between two times can be due to vertical crown growth of trees or to lateral growth of branches. The latter process gives canopy height change values unrelated to actual stem elongation.
   Lateral growth is a source of uncertainties in height change analyses because canopy height models do not contain information on the source of the growth. Lateral infilling of open space in the canopy and vertical crown growth are important processes in the gap dynamics of temperate deciduous forests. Small gaps are expected to close more often by lateral growth of branches while larger gaps can sometimes close by the vertical crown growth of seedling and saplings. Yet, few studies have examined growth patterns in and out of gaps in temperate deciduous forests.
   We studied both unmanaged and managed temperate deciduous forests in southern Quebec, Canada using a multi-temporal ALS dataset. A Bayesian stochastic model of three-dimensional dynamics was developed to classify whether measured height growth was due to lateral growth or vertical crown growth. A generalized additive model was also constructed to relate vertical crown growth to the height of trees.
   Between 10.6% and 13.7% of the canopy height model's pixels changed value due to lateral growth. There was no clear temporal trend for the frequencies of lateral growth in the managed forests chronosequence. Frequencies of lateral growth were also comparable between unmanaged and managed sites. Treetops of dominant trees grew slowly while crown edges of those trees grew both vertically and laterally. Our results show that canopy structure recovery in managed forests occurs through faster vertical crown growth of trees < 10 m tall and lower tree mortality compared to unmanaged forests.

AB Context information is rarely used in the object-based landcover classification. Previous models that attempted to utilize this information usually required the user to input empirical values for critical model parameters, leading to less optimal performance. Multi-view image information is useful for improving classification accuracy, but the methods to assimilate multi-view information to make it usable for context driven models have not been explored in the literature. Here we propose a novel method to exploit the multi-view information for generating class membership probability. Moreover, we develop a new conditional random field model to integrate multi-view information and context information to further improve landcover classification accuracy. This model does not require the user to manually input parameters because all parameters in the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model are fully learned from the training dataset using the gradient descent approach. Using multi-view data extracted from small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), we experimented with Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) classifiers to test model performance. The results showed that our model improved average overall accuracies from 58.3% to 74.7% for the GMM classifier, 75.8% to 87.3% for the RF classifier, 75.0% to 84.4% for the SVM classifier and 80.3% to 86.3% for the DCNN classifier. Although the degree of improvement may depend on the specific classifier respectively, the proposed model can significantly improve classification accuracy irrespective of classifier type.

AB The improved spatial and temporal resolution of latest-generation Earth Observation missions, such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, has increased the potential of remote sensing for mapping land surface phenology in inland water systems.
   The ability of a time series of medium-resolution satellite data to generate quantitative information on macrophyte phenology was examined, focusing on three temperate shallow lakes with connected wetlands in Italy, France, and Romania.
   Leaf area index (LAI) maps for floating and emergent macrophyte growth forms were derived from a semiempirical regression model based on the best-performing spectral index, with an error level of 0.11 m(2) m(-2). Phenology metrics were computed from LAI time series using TIMESAT to analyze the seasonal dynamics of macrophyte spatial distribution patterns and species-dependent variability. Particular seasonal patterns seen in the autochthonous and allochthonous species across the three study areas related to local ecological and hydrological conditions.
   How characteristics of the satellite dataset (cloud cover threshold, temporal resolution, and missing acquisitions) influenced the phenology metrics obtained was also assessed. Our results indicate that, with a full-resolution time series (5-day revisit time), cloud cover introduced a bias in the phenology metrics of less than 2 days. Even when the temporal resolution was reduced to 15 days (like the Landsat revisit time) the timing of the start and the peak of macrophyte growth could still be mapped with an error of no more than 2-3 days.

AB PROBA-V instrument launched in 2013 is offering a global daily coverage at pixel resolutions of 333 m and 1 km in three spectral bands (BLUE, RED, NIR) and 600 m for shortwave infrared (SWIR). The PROBA-V mission is the follow-on of the VEGETATION program started in 2000, which allowed generating long-term series at 1 km pixel resolution. The PROBA-V products belong to the Copernicus Global Land Service portfolio (http://land. copernicus.eu/global/). The sensor design of PROBA-V with oriented cameras offers a wide field of view (FOV) for sampling the BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function). This paper details the methodology implemented at the premises of VITO (Flemish Institute for Technological Research) with the aim to disseminate routinely from PROBA-V daily observations for both surface albedo (SA) and top-of-canopy corrected reflectance (TOC-R) products. The method classically operates a selection of cloudless scenes, performs atmospheric corrections, and finally applies a correction of directional effects on a pixel per pixel basis. The synthesis period is the decade and the composite period is 20 days. Such choice is a pointwise sampling as being a trade-off between the availability of clear scenes and the timescale for phenology. Regarding the albedo catalogue, a narrow-band to broadband conversion is stipulated. A recurrent technique serves for gap-filling based on the spread of weighed a priori data. Additional information concerns the quality flag and the age of the product. Preliminary accuracy assessment is performed through a comparison with the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6. Dependable spatial consistency is reached except for wintertime with deviations in terms of rmse (root mean square errors) about 0.03 for visible and shortwave domains, and 0.04 for near infrared. Besides, both PROBA-V and MODIS C6 exhibit close time profiles, marked by smoothness or rapid transitions. Results over 10 confidence sites reveals rmse values of 0.032 and bias of 0.01 over the 2014 full annual cycle.

AB Horizontal and altitudinal redistribution of snow by wind transport and avalanches can be important controls on small- and large-scale snow accumulation patterns that control meltwater supply in alpine environments. Redistribution processes control the spatial variability of snow accumulation, which not only controls meltwater supply, but also regulates snowmelt timing, duration, and rates, as well as snow-covered area depletion and the variable contributing area for meltwater runoff generation. However, most hydrological models and land surface schemes do not consider snow redistribution processes, and those that do are difficult to verify without spatially distributed snow depth measurements. These are rarely available in both high resolution and covering large scales. As an increased number of hydrological models include snow redistribution processes there is a need for additional snowcover metrics to verify snow redistribution schemes over large areas using readily available data.
   This study develops novel high-resolution (20 m), snowcover indices from remotely sensed imagery (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) to evaluate snow redistribution models over alpine areas without in-situ or airborne snow observations. A snowcover absence (SA) index, calculated from snow-free areas during the winter, identifies areas of wind erosion or avalanche source areas. A snowcover persistence (SP) index, calculated from snow-covered areas during the summer, identifies snow deposition in drifts and avalanche deposits.
   The snowcover indices captured the relative differences in surface observations of snow presence and absence between exposed and sheltered sites on an intensely instrumented ridge in the Canadian Rockies Hydrological Observatory. Within the Tuolumne River Basin in central California (1100 km(2)), the SP index captured roughly half of the spatial variability (R-2 = 0.49 to 0.56) in peak SWE as estimated from airborne LiDAR-derived snow depths. At the individual mountain ridge scale (similar to 800 m), variability in both ablation and snow redistribution controlled the SP patterns over 7979 ridges. Differences in shortwave irradiance explained 76% of the SP variance across ridges, but could not explain smaller-scale (similar to 100 m) SP peaks that are associated with snowdrifts and avalanche deposits. The snowcover indices can be used to evaluate snow redistribution models of the finer scale impacts of snow redistribution by wind and gravity as long as the larger scale influences of spatially variable solar irradiance effects are also simulated.

AB A novel method was proposed to detect low stratus and fog (LSF) at dawn during the summertime using near simultaneous observations from dual geostationary-orbit satellites (GEOs): the Korean Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS; 128.2 degrees E) and the Chinese Feng-Yun-2D (FY-2D; 86.5 degrees E). The orbital positions of the GEOs provided a large difference (similar to 46.5 degrees) in the viewing zenith angle (VZA) in the study region (122-132 degrees E, 32.5-42.5 degrees N) and high contrast observations at dawn. Numerical simulations were carried out to derive the optical properties of the LSF and the radiative differences between the GEOs due to both the VZA and spectral response function (SRF). The conventional threshold method, which used the visible reflectance at 0.67 mu m (120.67) and the brightness temperature difference between 3.7 mu m and 11 mu m (BTD3.7-11), had limitations in detecting LSF at dawn due to weak visible light and fast night-to-day transition. We utilized the observed stereo differences (Delta R-0.67, Delta BTD3.7-11) between the two GEOs to improve LSF detection. The dual-satellite observations were verified with ground-based data from 45 stations in South Korea co-located with each GEO pixel. The Delta R-0.67 threshold value showed better accuracy (78% vs. 67%) than the conventional R-0.67 threshold method. In addition, the Delta BTD3.7-11 threshold was better (55% vs. 38%) than the Delta BTD3.7-11 threshold. The dual-satellite method allowed more reliable LSF detection using the combination of Delta R-0.67 and R-0.67, particularly for LSF without cumuliform or high clouds. Our method is applicable to multiple geostationary satellites for continuous LSF monitoring.

AB Soil mapping has been identified as key to environmental issues. The determination of soil attributes to achieve the best decision making on land use planning is crucial. The use of remote sensing (satellite images) can improve understanding of the surface, since it collects a spectral reflectance fingerprint related to soil properties. However, methodologies still gather spatially fragmented information on bare soil in a single image; thus, there is still room to improve information as a continuous surface. This work has the purpose of developing a procedure using multi-temporal satellite image information, aiming to construct a single synthetic image which would represent soils. The work was carried out in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, on a site covering 14,614 km(2). The procedure, designated as Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3), is based on the following steps: a) creation of a database with Landsat 5 legacy data.; b) filtering of the database to provide images only from the dry season in the region; c) insertion of a set of rules into the system to filter other objects besides soils; d) Each bare soil occurrence for each location along the time-series was used to calculate a Temporal Synthetic Spectral Reflectance (TESS) of the soil surface; e) aggregation of all TESS composes the Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI); f) quantitative and qualitative validation of the SYSI through the correlation between laboratory and TESS, soil line assessment and the principal component analysis (PCA). GEOS3 was able to provide the best representative reflectance of soils for each band during the historical period. Thus, TESS is not the 'true' but a synthetic spectral reflectance. The canonical correlation between laboratory and satellite data reached 0.93. A value of up to 0.88 in the Pearson's correlation between laboratory and TESS was also achieved. In a single scene, only 0.5% of area was available as isolated bare soil for spatial analysis. However, SYSI reached 68%. Considering only the sugarcane agricultural areas, a value of 92% was achieved. Our study indicates that a multi-temporal data mining procedure can retrieve soil surface representation. The key to the results was calculating the median spectral reflectance from the bare soil pixels along the period of the time series. GEOS3 products can aid soil evaluation by assisting in digital soil mapping, soil security, precision agriculture, soil attribute quantification, soil conservation, environment monitoring and soil sample allocation, among others.

AB Multi-spectral imagery from the Landsat family of satellites has been used to map forest properties for decades, but accurate forest type characterizations at a 30-m Landsat resolution have remained an ongoing challenge, especially over large areas. We combined existing Landsat time series algorithms to quantify both harmonic and phenological metrics in a new set of spectral-temporal features that can be produced seamlessly across many Landsat scenes. Harmonic metrics characterize mean annual reflectance and seasonal variability, while phenological metrics quantify the timing of seasonal events. We assessed the performance of spectral-temporal features derived from time series of all available observations (1985-2015) relative to more conventional single date and multi-date inputs. Performance was determined based on agreement with a reference dataset for eight New England forest types at both the pixel and polygon scale. We found that spectral-temporal features consistently and significantly (paired t-test, p << 0.01) outperformed all feature sets derived from individual images and multi-date combinations in all measures of agreement considered. Harmonic features, such as annual amplitude and model fit error, aid in distinguishing deciduous hardwoods from conifer species, while phenology features, like the timing of autumn onset and growing season length, were useful in separating hardwood classes. This study represents an important step toward large-scale forest type mapping using spectral-temporal Landsat features by providing a quantitative assessment of the advantages of harmonic and phenology features derived from time series of Landsat data as compared with more conventional single-date and multi-date classification inputs.

AB Two major episodes of seagrass mortality have occurred in Florida Bay in the past 30 years: The first occurred between 1987 and 1991 and the second began in 2015. In both episodes, dense beds of turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) were decimated. Elevated water temperature and hypersalinity have been implicated as contributing factors in both mortality events. During both die-off events seagrass beds on shallow (Z approximate to 0.3 m) mudbanks in western Florida Bay were disproportionately affected when compared to neighboring seagrass in deeper basins (Z approximate to 1.5 m). A network of in situ monitoring stations has measured sea surface temperature and salinity at hourly intervals in 16 basins in Florida Bay from August 2009 to the present day and these data aided in diagnosing the 2015-2016 die-off event. However, very few in situ observations of sea surface temperature have been collected on Florida Bay's shallow mudbanks as most are inaccessible by boat. As a result, our understanding of the role of elevated SST in shaping the spatial patterns of seagrass mortality is hindered by the spatial distribution of the in situ monitoring data and its record length. Therefore, we turn to remotely sensed SST data to expand our spatial coverage to include the entire Florida Bay ecosystem and to extend the record length to include the 1987-1991 die-off event. 1 km MODIS SST shows that shallow mudbanks were consistently warmer (by up to 6 degrees C) than nearby deeper basins. While water depth is likely the primary driver of spatial variability in SST, Landsat-8 surface reflectance data suggest that shallow seagrass beds could have suffered from the added influence of low surface reflectance, which might have further contributed to their thermal stress. Daily 0.25 degrees AVHRR SST shows that the August maximum SST has increased by 1 degrees C from 1981 to 2016, which is a cause for concern for the future of seagrass in Florida Bay. Correlation of monthly AVHRR SST anomalies with the multivariate ENSO index shows that ENSO can only partially explain the anomalous temperatures. When viewed together, the in situ and remotely sensed SST suggests that both extended exposure to anomalously warm temperatures and large, rapid changes in temperature could have contributed to seagrass mortality during both events.

AB The term shelf-life is used to characterize the elapsed time beyond which a commodity loses its usefulness. The term is most often used with reference to foods and medicines, but herein it is used to characterize the elapsed time beyond which airborne laser scanning (ALS) data are no longer useful for enhancing inferences for forest inventory population parameters. National forest inventories (NFI) have a long history of using remotely sensed auxiliary information to enhance inferences. Although the combination of model-assisted estimators and ALS auxiliary data has been demonstrated to be particularly useful for this purpose, the expense associated with the acquisition of the ALS data has been an argument against their operational use. However, the longer the shelf-life of ALS data, the less the continuing acquisition costs and the greater the utility of the data.
   The objective of the study was to assess the shelf-life of ALS data for enhancing inferences in the form of confidence intervals for mean aboveground, live tree, stem biomass per unit area. Confidence intervals were constructed using both model-assisted estimators and post-stratified estimators, four measurements of mostly the same forest inventory plots at 5-year intervals over a 17-year period, and a single set of ALS data acquired near the end of the 17-year period. The study area in north central Minnesota in the USA was characterized by naturally regenerated, uneven-aged, mixed species stands on both lowland and upland sites. The primary conclusions were twofold. First, the shelf-life of ALS data when used with model-assisted estimators exceeded 10 years, and second, even for 12 years elapsed time between plot measurement and ALS data acquisition, the variance of the model-assisted estimator of the mean was smaller by a factor of at least 1.75 than the variance of the stratified estimator used by the national forest inventory.

AB The overarching objective of this study was to produce a disaggregated SMOS Soil Moisture (SM) product using. land surface parameters from a geostationary satellite in a region covering a diverse range of ecosystem types. SEVIRI data at 15 min temporal resolution were used to derive the Temperature and Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) that served as SM proxy within the disaggregation process. West Africa (3 degrees N 26 degrees W; 28 degrees N 26 degrees E) was selected as a case study as it presents both an important North-South climate gradient and a diverse range of ecosystem types. The main challenge was to set up a methodology applicable over a large area that overcomes the constraints of SMOS (low spatial resolution) and TVDI (requires similar atmospheric forcing and triangular shape formed when plotting morning rise temperature versus fraction of vegetation cover) in order to produce a 0.05 degrees resolution disaggregated SMOS SM product at the sub-continental scale. Consistent cloud cover appeared as one of the main constraints for deriving TVDI, especially during the rainy season and in the southern parts of the region and a large adjustment window (105 x 105 SEVIRI pixels) was therefore deemed necessary. Both the original and the disaggregated SMOS SM products described well the seasonal dynamics observed at six locations of in situ observations. However, there was an overestimation in both products for sites in the humid southern regions; most likely caused by the presence of forest. Both TVDI and the associated disaggregated SM product were found to be highly sensitive to algorithm input parameters; especially for conditions of high fraction of vegetation cover. Additionally, seasonal dynamics in TVDI did not follow the seasonal patterns of SM. Still, its spatial heterogeneity was found to be a good proxy for disaggregating SMOS SM data; main river networks and spatial patterns of SM extremes (i.e. droughts and floods) not seen in the original SMOS SM product were revealed in the disaggregated SM product for a test case of July September 2012. The disaggregation methodology thereby successfully increased the spatial resolution of SMOS SM, with potential application for local drought/flood monitoring of importance for the livelihood of the population of West Africa.

AB Many passive microwave remote sensing applications such as land surface temperature, snow water equivalent and soil moisture retrievals need to take into account a soil parameterization to the overall surface signal emission. Soil emission modeling presents large uncertainties when the soil is frozen. In this paper, an empirical retrieval method is presented, specifically for rough frozen soil permittivity estimates at 10.7, 19 and 37 GHz. The method was tested and validated using in-situ passive microwave measurements at incidence angles from 0 to 60 degrees of sub-arctic'frozen organic soils in Northeastern Canada. The retrieved permittivity values give an overall RMSE between the measured and simulated brightness temperatures of 4.6 K for all frequencies combined. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the different soil parameters optimized in this study. This analysis suggests that the accuracy of the retrieved parameters, using the method given here, is of +/- 1.00 for the permittivity and +/- 0.12 cm for surface roughness. Also, a comparison was conducted between the parameterization used in this study and the one of Weginfiller and Matzler (1999) to estimate the soil contribution to the emitted brightness temperature of snowpacks. An improvement of 66% of the RMSE between the modeled and measured snow brightness temperatures was observed when using the approach of this study compared to the previous work. The method shows great potential to improve the estimation of the frozen soil contribution to the measured passive microwave brightness temperature.

AB Atmospheric correction (AC) is important in pre-processing of airborne hyperspectral imagery. AC requires knowledge on the atmospheric state expressed by atmospheric condition parameters. Their values are affected by uncertainties that propagate to the application level. This study investigates the propagation of uncertainty from column water vapor (CWV) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) towards abundance maps obtained by means of spectral unmixing. Both Fully Constrained Least Squares (FCLS) and FCLS with Total Variation (FCLS-TV) are applied. We use five simulated datasets contaminated by various noise levels. Three datasets cover two spectral scenarios with different endmembers. A univariate and a bivariate analysis are carried out on CWV and AOD. The other two datasets are used to analyze the effect of surface albedo. The analysis identifies trends in performance degradation caused by the gradual shift in parameter values from their true value. The maximum achievable performance depends upon spectral characteristics of the datasets, noise level, and surface albedo. As expected, under noisy conditions FCLS-TV performs better than FCLS. Our research opens new perspectives for applications where estimation of reflectance is so far considered to be deterministic.

AB Amazonian tropical forests play a significant role in global water, carbon and energy cycles. Considering the importance of this biome and climate change projections, the monitoring of vegetation status of these rainforests becomes of significant importance. In this context vegetation temperature is presented as a key variable linked with plant physiology. In particular some studies showed the relationship between this variable and the CO2 absorption capacity and biomass loss of these tropical forests proving the potential use of vegetation temperature in the monitoring of the vegetation status. Nevertheless, the use of thermal remote sensing data over tropical forests still has some limitations being of special importance the atmospheric correction under very humid conditions and the possible high occurrence of cloudy pixels. In order to mitigate these limitations over the Amazon region, we present in this paper a new processing methodology to derive a LST product from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The LST product was generated using a tuned split window equation and cloud information derived from the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm. This LST product was validated using simulated and in situ data, and inter compared to the MODIS LST standard product (MOD11). Validation analysis shows that the new LST product reduces the RMSE by 0.6 to 1 K when compared to the MODIS standard LST product, mainly because of a reduction of the bias. We also show a preliminary intercomparison between MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) LST spatial patterns to illustrate the feasibility of VIIRS to extend forward the MODIS LST temporal series.

AB Wars have major economic, political and human implications, and they can strongly affect environment and land use, not only during the conflicts, but also afterwards. However, data on the land use effects of wars is sparse, especially for World War II, the largest war in history. Our goal was to quantify and understand the time-lagged land use effects of WWII in Romania, by applying Structure from Motion technology to 1960s Corona spy satellite photography. We quantified forest cutting across Romania from 1955 to 1965. This was a period when Romania's economy recovered from the war and when Romania established close economic ties to the Soviet Union, and when the Romanian government made reparation payments to the Soviet Union. To understand the effects of war, we developed an accurate and fast method to orthorectify high-resolution Corona photography in mountain areas, and rectified scanned Corona photography based on Structure from. Motion technology. Our study area of 212,000 km(2) was covered by 208 Corona film strips, which we rectified with an overall average accuracy of 14.3 m. We identified 530,000 ha of forest cuts over this time period, the rate of which is three times higher than contemporary cutting rates. Our results highlight that the environmental and land use effects of WWII were substantial in Romania, due to reparation payments, post-war policies regarding resource exploitation, and technological and infrastructural development. Our research provides quantitative evidence of how wars can cause time-lagged and long-term effects on the environment. Methodologically, we advance remote sensing science by pioneering a new approach to orthorectify Corona photography for large areas effectively. Corona data are available globally. Our approach facilitates the extension of the data record of space borne observation of the earth by one to two decades earlier than what is possible with satellite datasets.

AB Time series analysis of Landsat is limited by sparse and irregular sampling of clear-sky observations due to acquisition limitations, clouds, shadows, atmosphere, and sensor artifacts. Many remote sensing applications utilizing coarse spatial resolution time series methods are not suitable for Landsat due to observation sparsity. In this research we develop an imputation based approach to constrain the harmonic modeling method of Zhu et al. (2012, 2015) and Zhu and Woodcock (2014b) to reconstruct Landsat time series at a regular temporal interval. The approach was assessed for a boreal forest region in central Canada for different sparsity conditions. The imputed Landsat estimates for a specific pixel were predicted from climate or AVHRR data. These estimates were given a small weight relative to available Landsat observations in fitting the final harmonic model essentially constraining it to a more plausible range. In addition we implemented the model in a piecewise manner to handle non-linear temporal drift related to factors such as climate change, drought, or the allometric nature of vegetation regrowth. Results show that the inclusion of imputed estimates improved model predictions in the presence of observation sparsity. Where there were less than 3 observations within +/- 20 days the imputation approach performed better, with a reduction in average reflectance error of 0.001 to 2.5. Error assessment with hold out observations, comparison to MODIS time series, and example predicted images are presented.

AB The Earth System behaves as a highly coupled system comprising physical, chemical, biological, and anthropogenic components and processes with complex interactions and feedbacks between them. Climate change is arguably the greatest challenge to balance in the Earth system. The Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2016) recognised the need to reduce the risks from and impacts of climate change and called for the increase in the global average temperature to be held well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, with the ideal aim being to limit it to 1.5 degrees C. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreement is based on the evidence for, and likely causes of, climate change synthesised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and is supported, for climate, by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). GCOS has defined a set of Essential Climate Variables (ECV), established the requirements for their systematic observation, and the development of data archives, needed to support the study the climate system. The Climate Change Initiative (CCI), represents the contribution by the European Space Agency (ESA) to GCOS. CCI is a programme designed to bring together European expertise in Earth Observation with that from the climate research community to address those ECV that can be generated using satellite observations. Specifically the objective is 'to realise the full potential of the long-term global Earth Observation archives that ESA together with its Member States have established over the last thirty years, as a significant and timely contribution to the ECV databases required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)'. In doing so the intended legacy of the programme is to put in place mechanisms capable of providing long term, fully traceable, and transparent access to its records. This paper provides an overview of the CCI Programme and highlights a few of its achievements to date. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Disaggregation of land surface temperature (DLST), the aim of which is to generate LSTs with fine resolution, has been attracting increasing attention since the 1980s. The past three decades have been witness to the emergence of DLST methods in large numbers, the accuracies of which were often assessed by comparing the disaggregated with fine spatial resolution LSTs using error indexes such as the root mean square error (RMSE). However, the majority of previous error indexes are, by their nature, insufficient for assessing the performances of DLST methods. This insufficiency is due in part to their lower competence at distinguishing the DLST error from LST retrieval errors and in part to their inability to remove the process controls resulting from different thermal contrasts, temperature units, and resolution ratios among different scenarios in which DLST is conducted. This is also because they are unable to denote the sharpening statuses of the DLST results (e.g., under- or over-sharpening). This status quo has made the evaluation of method performances challenging and sometimes unreliable.
   To better assess DLST method performances under diversified scenarios, we formulated five protocols, through which a simple yet flexible index (SIFI) was subsequently designed. The establishment of an SIFI includes the following four steps: (1) a detail-based evaluation, which is designed primarily to exclude the impacts of systematic deviations on estimated LSTs; (2) a Gaussian normalization, which is primarily intended to remove the differences in temperature units and thermal contrasts; (3) a triple comparison, with the aim of attenuating the influence of the difference in the resolution ratio in comparisons of method performances; and (4) a piecewise comparison, which is primarily scheduled to distinguish among the three sharpening statuses, under sharpening, acceptable over-sharpening, and unacceptable over-sharpening. The evaluation ability of SIFI was compared with those of the RMSE, Erreur Relative Globale Adimensionnelle de Synthese (ERGAS), and image quality index (Q) using simulation tests and actual thermal data. The results illustrate that SIFI generally outperforms the other indexes; it is able to mitigate the impacts from process errors and controls during evaluation and is able to indicate the sharpening statuses accurately. We believe this new index will likely promote the design of future DLST algorithms and procedures.

AB Large-scale crop monitoring and yield estimation are important for both scientific research and practical applications. Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for regional and global cropland monitoring, particularly in data-sparse regions that lack reliable ground observations and reporting. The conventional approach of using visible and near-infrared based vegetation index (VI) observations has prevailed for decades since the onset of the global satellite era. However, other satellite data encompass diverse spectral ranges that may contain complementary information on crop growth and yield, but have been largely understudied and underused. Here we conducted one of the first attempts at synergizing multiple satellite data spanning a diverse spectral range, including visible, near-infrared, thermal and microwave, into one framework to estimate crop yield for the U.S. Corn Belt, one of the world's most important food baskets. Specifically, we included MODIS Enhanced VI (EVI), estimated Gross Primary Production based on GOME-2 solar-induced fluorescence (SIF-GPP), thermal-based ALEXI Evapotranspiration (ET), QuikSCAT Ku-band radar backscatter, and AMSR-E X-band passive microwave Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) in this study, benchmarked on USDA county-level crop yield statistics. We used Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), an effective statistical model for dimension reduction, to distinguish commonly shared and unique individual information from the various satellite data and other ancillary climate information for crop yield estimation. In the PLSR model that includes all of the satellite data and climate variables from 2007 to 2009, we assessed the first two major PLSR components and found that the first component (an integrated proxy of crop aboveground biomass) explained 82% variability of modelled crop yield, and the second component (dominated by environmental stresses) explained 15% variability of modelled crop yield. We found that most of the satellite derived metrics (e.g. SIF-GPP, radar back scatter, EVI, VOD, ALEXI-ET) share common information related to aboveground crop biomass (i.e. the first component). For this shared information, the SIF-GPP and backscatter data contain almost the same amount of information as EVI at the county scale. When removing the above shared component from all of the satellite data, we found that EVI and SIF-GPP do not provide much extra information; instead, Ku-band backscatter, thermal-based ALEXI-ET, and X-band VOD provide unique information on environmental stresses that improves overall crop yield predictive skill. In particular, Ku-band backscatter and associated differences between morning and afternoon overpasses contribute unique information on crop growth and environmental stress. Overall, using satellite data from various spectral bands significantly improves regional crop yield predictions. The additional use of ancillary climate data (e.g. precipitation and temperature) further improves model skill, in part because the crop reproductive stage related to harvest index is highly sensitive to environmental stresses but they are not fully captured by the satellite data used in our study. We conclude that using satellite data across various spectral ranges can improve monitoring of large-scale crop growth and yield beyond what can be achieved from individual sensors. These results also inform the synergistic use and development of current and next generation satellite missions, including NASA ECOSTRESS, SMAP, and 000-2, for agricultural applications.

AB Accuracy assessment of remote sensing soft (sub-pixel) classifications is a challenging topic. Previous efforts have focused on constructing a soft classification error matrix and producing summary measures to describe overall and per-class map accuracy. However, these summary assessments do not provide information on the spatial distribution of the soft classification error as distributed at the individual pixel level. This is important because the map error of a given class may vary considerably over different regions. Spatial interpolation has been previously used for predicting soft classification error at the pixel level. Here, we propose two alternative domains for soft classification error interpolation, the spectral and mapped class proportion domains. In the spectral domain we interpolate errors in the classification feature space, whereas in the mapped class proportion domain interpolation takes place in a space with dimensions defined by the mapped class proportions (i.e., the output of the soft classification). The two newly proposed prediction methods (spectral domain and mapped class proportion domain), spatial interpolation, and a summary measure method were evaluated using 23 test regions, each 10 km x 10 km, distributed throughout the United States. These 10 km x 10 km blocks had complete coverage reference data (where the reference classification was determined by manual interpretation) and the predicted error maps were then evaluated by comparing them to these complete coverage reference error maps. Mean absolute error was used to quantify the agreement of the predicted error maps to the reference error maps. The spectral and mapped class proportion methods generally outperformed the spatial interpolation and the summary measure methods both in terms of smaller mean absolute error and visual similarity of predicted error maps to the reference error maps. The superiority of the new methods over spatial interpolation is an important result because spatial interpolation is a familiar method analysts would commonly consider for modeling spatial variation of classification error. The predicted soft classification error maps provide a straightforward visual assessment of the spatial patterns of error that can accompany the original classification products to enhance their value in subsequent analysis and modeling tasks. Furthermore, from the standpoint of implementation, our methods do not require additional datasets; the same test dataset currently used for confusion/error matrix construction can be used for our error interpolation methods.

AB In this study, we investigate the causative processes responsible for the observed enhancement in the tropospheric and surface ozone during December 09-11, 2008 orography induced gravity wave event over Himalayan region. The analysis is done using surface ozone measurements and satellite datasets from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder/Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AIRS/AMSU-A), COSMIC, TES and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO). Observations depict a two fold increase in surface and tropospheric ozone during the event as compared to normal days in both AIRS and TES ozone measurements. COSMIC temperature perturbations show generation of shorter vertical wavelengths efficient for the sub-tropical tropopause folding due to orography induced gravity waves. Moreover, the intense tropopause folding as evidenced by upward-downward vertical velocities couplet could trigger the intrusion of stratospheric ozone rich air into upper tropospheric ozone poor air as also confirmed by high values of potential vorticity during the observational period. Hence, present study reemphasizes the importance of wave induced atmospheric dynamics on atmospheric constituents' especially tropospheric ozone over Himalayan region. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Real-time de-noising of satellite-derived soil moisture observations presents opportunities to deliver more accurate and timely satellite data for direct satellite users. So far, the most commonly used techniques for reducing the impact of noise in the retrieved satellite soil moisture observations have been based on moving average filters and Fourier based methods. This paper introduces a new alternative wavelet based approach called Wiener-Wavelet-Based Filter (WiW), which uses an entropy based de-noising method to design a causal version of the filter. WiW is used as a post-retrieval processing tool to enhance the quality of observations derived from one active (the Advanced Scatterometer, ASCAT) and one passive (the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System, AMSRE) satellite sensors. The filter is then compared with two candidate de-noising techniques, namely: i) a Wiener causal filter introduced by Su et al. (2013) and ii) a conventional moving average filter. The validation is carried out globally at 173 (for AMSRE) and 243 (for ASCAT) soil moisture stations. Results show that all the three de-noising techniques can increase the agreement between satellite and in situ measurements in terms of correlation and signal-to-noise ratio. The Wiener-based methods show least signal distortion and demonstrate to be conservative in retaining the signal information in de-noised data. Importantly, the Wiener filters can be calibrated with the data at hand, without the need for auxiliary data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forest vegetation classification and structure measurements are fundamental steps for planning, monitoring, and evaluating large-scale forest changes including restoration treatments. High spatial and spectral resolution remote sensing data are critically needed to classify vegetation and measure their 3-dimensional (3D) canopy structure at the level of individual species. Here we test high-resolution lidar, hyperspectral, and multispectral data collected from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and demonstrate a lidar-hyperspectral image fusion method in treated and control forests with varying tree density and canopy cover as well as in an ecotone environment to represent a gradient of vegetation and topography in northern Arizona, U.S.A. The fusion performs better (88% overall accuracy) than either data type alone, particularly for species with similar spectral signatures, but different canopy sizes. The lidar data provides estimates of individual tree height (R-2 = 0.90; RMSE = 2.3 m) and crown diameter (R-2 = 0.72; RMSE = 0.71 m) as well as total tree canopy cover (R-2 = 0.87; RMSE = 9.5%) and tree density (R-2 = 0.77; RMSE = 0.69 trees/cell) in 10 m cells across thin only, burn only, thin-and-burn, and control treatments, where tree cover and density ranged between 22 and 50% and 1-3.5 trees/cell, respectively. The lidar data also produces highly accurate digital elevation model (DEM) (R-2 = 0.92; RMSE = 0.75 m). In comparison, 3D data derived from the multispectral data via structure-from-motion produced lower correlations with field-measured variables, especially in dense and structurally complex forests. The lidar, hyperspectral, and multispectral sensors, and the methods demonstrated here can be widely applied across a gradient of vegetation and topography for monitoring landscapes undergoing large-scale changes such as the forests in the southwestern U.S.A.

AB Tropical dry forests provide globally important ecosystem services and host exceptionally high biodiversity. These biomes are currently under immense pressure, particularly for conversion to agriculture, and already experience high global deforestation rates. Miombo forests in Southern Angola are affected by deforestation, fragmentation and degradation, caused mainly by an increasing rural population who follows a traditional farming system of shifting cultivation with slash-and-burn agriculture. After the termination of the civil war in 2002, population growth and resettlements have accelerated the use of woody resources, selective logging and clearing for cultivation purposes and led to an exceedance of sustainability thresholds. Large scale projects are expected to put further pressure on the forests and increase the potential of conflicts regarding land resources and competition with local subsistence farming.
   We use an existing time series segmentation tool (LandTrendr) with a time series of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) data in combination with adapted temporal metrics to provide information about the dynamics of different cultivation patterns, to gain insight into historical developments and to assess temporal cultivation characteristics. We define cleared areas and cultivation time on a pixel-by-pixel basis providing temporal and spatial information on current and past changes from 1989 to 2013 using data from Landsat 5-8. Overall accuracy for the disturbance detection is 72%. We can follow the effect of armed conflicts on agricultural expansion with a drop in deforestation rate of more than 70% from 12,000 to 4000 ha per year (1994-1998) and subsequently tripling to 12,000 ha per year again after 2002. Deforestation patterns are in accordance with previous multi-temporal studies, although time series segmentation reveals more detailefi information on deforestation and cultivation dynamics.
   We successfully separate areas of different historic backgrounds and agricultural dynamics, e.g. areas that were severely affected during the civil war, which transition from shifting to semi-permanent and permanent systems. We provide recommendations for the assessment of agricultural dynamics in similar areas where ground data and basic information is missing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forest inventories comprise observations, models and sampling. Airborne LiDAR has established its role in providing observations of canopy geometry and topography. These data are input for estimation of important forest properties to support forestry-related decision-making. A major deficiency in forest remote sensing is tree species identification. This study examines the option of using multi-footprint airborne LiDAR data. Features of such sensor design exist in recently introduced multispectral laser scanners. The first objective was to acquire radiometrically normalized, multi-footprint (11, 22, 44 and 59 cm) waveform (WF) data that characterize 1064nm backscatter reflectance on the interval scale. The second objective was to analyze and validate the data quality in order to draw the correct conclusions about the effect of footprint size on WFs from natural and man-made targets. The experiment was carried out in Finland. Footprint variation was generated by acquiring data at different flying heights and by adjusting the transmitted power. The LiDAR campaign was successful and the data were of sufficient quality, except for a 1 dB trend due to the atmosphere. Significant findings were made conceming the magnitude of atmospheric losses, the linearity of the amplitude scale and the bandwidth characteristics of the receiver, the stability of the transmitter, the precision of the amplitude data and the transmission losses in canopies and power lines, as well as the response of WF attributes to footprint size in forest canopies. Multi-footprint data are a promising approach although the tree species-specific signatures were weak. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate three-dimensional information on canopy structure contributes to better understanding of radiation fluxes within the canopy and the physiological processes associated with them. Small-footprint airborne laser scanning (ALS) data proved valuable for characterising the three-dimensional structure of forest canopies and the retrieval of biophysical parameters such as plant and leaf area index (PAI and LAI), fractional cover or canopy layering. Nevertheless, few studies analysed combined occluded and observed canopy elements in dense vegetation as a result of airborne laser scanning geometries. The occluded space contains a substantial amount of vegetation elements (i.e. leaf, needle and wood material), which are missing in the analysis of the three-dimensional canopy structure. Consequently, this will lead to erroneous retrieval of biophysical parameters. In this study, we introduce a voxel traversal algorithm to characterise ALS observation patterns inside a voxel grid. We analyse the dependence of occluded and unobserved canopy volume on pulse density, flight strip overlap and season of overflight in a temperate mixed forest. ALS measurements under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions were used. For cross-comparison purposes, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measurements on a 50x50 m(2) subplot under leaf-on conditions were used. TLS acquisitions were able to depict the three-dimensional structure of the forest plot in high detail, ranging up to the top-most canopy layer.
   Our results at 1 m voxel size show that even with the highest average pulse density of 11 pulses/m(2), at least 25% of the forest canopy volume remains occluded in the ALS acquisition under leaf-on conditions. Comparison with TLS acquisitions further showed that roughly 28% of the vegetation elements detected by the TLS acquisitions were not detected by the ALS system due to occlusion effects. By combining leaf-on and leaf-off acquisitions, we were able to recover roughly 7% of the occluded vegetation elements from the leaf-on acquisition. We find that larger flight strip overlap can significantly increase the amount of observed canopy volume due to the added observation angles and increased pulse density. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Douro River represents the major freshwater input into the coastal ocean of the northwestern Iberian Peninsula. The seasonal and interannual variability of its turbid plume is investigated using ocean color composites from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites (2000-2014) and long-term records of river discharge, wind and precipitation rate. Regional climate indices, namely the Eastern Atlantic (EA) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), were analyzed to identify the influence of atmospheric variability on the generation of anomalous turbid river plume patterns. The connection between the monthly time series of normalized water leaving radiance at 555 nm (nLw(555)) and river discharge is high (r = 0.81), which indicates a strong link between river outflow and turbidity levels in the river plume. The equivalent result is found between precipitation and nLw(555) time series, but the peak correlation was found with a 1-month lag, revealing the importance of the river dams on the outflow regulation (r = 0.65). Lag correlations between nLw(555) and EA index show a peak at 1-month lag (r = 0.51). The relation between NAO index and Douro river discharge is considerable (-0.50), for a time lag of 1-month as well. However, the correlation coefficient between nLw(555) and NAO index presents a maximum peak for a longer period (r = -0.42 at 3-month). Anomalous turbid plume patterns, not related with estuarine outflow, are found during autumn 2004. Acoccolithophore bloom is proposed as a plausible explanation for these unexpected turbid patches.

AB This article introduces a novel methodology for automated classification of forest areas from airborne laser scanning (ALS) datasets based on two direct and simple rules: L-coefficient of variation Lcv = 0.5 and L-skewness Lskew = 0, thresholds based on descriptors of the mathematical properties of ALS height distributions. We observed that, while Lcv> 0.5 may represent forests with large tree size inequality, Lskew>0 can be an indicator for areas lacking a closed dominant canopy. Lcv = 0.5 discriminated forests with trees of approximately equal sizes (even tree size classes) from those with large tree size inequality (uneven tree size classes) with kappa K = 0.48 and overall accuracy OA = 92.4%, while Lskew= 0 segregated oligophotic and euphotic zones with K = 0.56 and OA = 84.6%. We showed that a supervised classification could only marginally improve some of these accuracy results. The rule-based approach presents a simple method for detecting structural properties key to tree competition and potential for natural regeneration. The study was carried out with low-density datasets from the national program on ALS surveying of Finland, which shows potential for replication with the ALS datasets typically acquired at nation-wide scales. Since the presented method was based on deductive mathematical rules for describing distributions, it stands out from inductive supervised and unsupervised classification methods which are more commonly used in remote sensing. Therefore, it presents an opportunity for deducing physical relations which could partly eliminate the need for supporting ALS applications with field plot data for training and modelling, at least in Boreal forest ecosystems.

AB The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission has provided a unique remote sensing capability for observing key variables of the hydrological cycle, such as the Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). However, due to some limitations related to the instrument interferometric concept and its challenging data processing, SMOS SSS maps still display significant artifacts and biases, especially close to the coast, mainly due to the presence of Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) and Land-sea contamination (LSC). In this paper, a new methodology for filtering salinity retrievals and correcting for spatial biases is introduced and validated. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Although studies based on satellite gravimetry (2003 2010) and laser altimetry (2003-2009) measurements have achieved region-wide glacier mass change for the Tien Shan, the dynamic process of glacier yet to be closely monitored and understood so that its impact can be assessed accurately. In this study, we investigated region wide glacier thickness change in the Central Tien Shan (CTS) during 2000-2012 by differencing the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM) with a newly constructed DEM from 27 TanDEM-X images. For a total glacier area of 7239.8 +/- 527.2 km(2), an average glacier thickness change rate of -0.24 +/- 0.22 m/a was derived. This result agrees well with the result based on satellite laser altimetry measurements reported earlier (-0.31 +/- 0.41 m/a). With temporal synchronization, a fine spatial resolution and wide coverage, our measurements are able to reveal abundant glacier change features and dependencies in the CTS. Firstly, the lower mountains have seen a more severe glacier decline, and the glaciers facing the prevailing wind (westerlies) have experienced a greater decline because of the stronger evaporation. Furthermore, those glaciers lying along the extremely high Meridian mountain range have obviously gained mass in their upper reaches, because the air current from the west is blocked and lifted by the Meridian mountain range. Secondly, for the entire glacier body, the theoretical hyperbolic dependence between debris thickness and ice decline was very difficult to establish. Some huge glaciers covered by heavy debris have still experienced a severe decline. However, even though the heavy debris did not prevent the ablation, its attenuating effects were considerable. Thirdly, for the glaciers that surged before 2000, the mass gain in the restoring zones has not been enough to cover the mass loss in ablation zones. Some large glaciers surged again during 2000-2012; however, with much lower magnitudes than in previous surges. In general, the surge glaciers have experienced a greater decline than the non-surge glaciers. Fourthly, due to the ice front calving and subglacial thermal erosion, glaciers connected to proglacial lakes have receded and thinned much more rapidly than the land-terminated glaciers. Overall, the glaciers in the CTS are more stable than those in other parts of the Tien Shan. However, the glacier state there is still alarming. A moderate average thinning rate was derived because the drastic thinning in the ablation zones was balanced by the slight thinning in the broad accumulation zones. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this study, we investigated the utility of hyperspectral remote sensing data for estimating green percent vegetation cover (PVC) for a study site in the Canadian High Arctic. A field experiment was conducted on Sabine Peninsula (76 degrees 27' N, 108 degrees 33' W), Melville Island, Nunavut, Canada to collect field spectra and PVC for five vegetation types, i.e., polar semi-desert (PD), dry mesic tundra (DMT), mesic tundra (MT), wet mesic tundra (WMT) and wet sedge/moss (WSM). Based on field spectra, two types of 2-band hyperspectral (i.e., Hyperion) and multi spectral (i.e., WorldView-3) vegetation indices (VIs) were derived using all possible band combinations. Optimal spectral bands were identified based on their correlations with green PVC. In addition, VIs designed for other landscapes were examined for their ability to estimate green PVC in an Arctic environment. The results indicate that PVC and spectral features for Arctic vegetation types were related to moisture content: (1) vegetation types with dry to intermediate soil moisture (e.g., PD, DMT and MT) possessed large amounts of bare soil and exhibited spectral properties similar to bare soil; and (2) vegetation types with high moisture content (e.g., WMT and WSM) exhibited spectra similar to senescent vegetation given the substantial proportion of senescent vegetation in these vegetation types. The optimal Hyperion spectral bands for estimating green PVC were located at the absorption features observed in Arctic vegetation spectra, including 681.20 nm (leaf pigment absorption); 721.90 nm and 732.07 nm (along the red-edge slope); 1174.77 nm and 1184.87 nm (leaf water absorption); and 1447.14 nm, 1457.23 nm, 2072.65 nm and 2102.94 nm (leaf cellulose and lignin absorption). Narrowband Vls exhibited a stronger correlation with green PVC than broadband Vls due to the finer spectral features sampled by hyperspectral data. Further, VIs designed to estimate leaf pigment and dry matter content (e.g., lignin and cellulose) showed strong correlations with green PVC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Soil moisture distributions with high spatio-temporal resolution are scarce but beneficial for understanding ecohydrological processes and closing the water cycle at the basin scale. Sensor networks are innovative in their ability to capture the spatio-temporal heterogeneity and dynamics of soil moisture; however, they cannot be used to directly derive spatially continuous soil moisture distributions. A Bayesian-based upscaling algorithm that utilizes MODIS-derived apparent thermal inertia is used to map daily soil moisture spatial patterns with a resolution of 1 km in the Babao River Basin, China. The 2-4 cm soil moisture observations from seven automatic meteorological stations located in different elevation zones from 3000 m to 3500 m are employed to validate the mapping algorithm. The correlation coefficient and unbiased root-mean-square error (RMSE) averaged 0.880 and 0.031 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, which indicate satisfactory estimation accuracy. The 1 km resolution soil moisture products are re-sampled to a resolution of 25 km and then compared to the level 3 Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Mission (SMOS) soil moisture product. The results show that both products exhibit strong temporal consistency; however, due to complex topography, the SMOS soil moisture is generally lower than that of the upscaling results. Semivariograms and an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis are used to analyze the space-time heterogeneities of soil moisture at the 1 km scale. In the summer, rainfall results in soil moisture with low spatial variability and a complex spatial structure. After the rainy season, the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture is affected by other factors, such as soil texture, evapotranspiration and topography. From the perspective of temporal variation, the upscaled soil moisture shows a well-defined seasonal cycle, which represents the effects of decreased rainfall from August to October. Because more rain falls in the summer due to the mountain microclimate, the oscillation in soil moisture is more pronounced over 20% of the area compared to that in other regions. Based on a validation analysis of the mapping results, the upscaling method is proven feasible, and the upscaled soil moisture can be used to analyze eco-hydrological processes and validate remote sensing products.

AB Climate change is rapidly altering snow cover conditions in seasonal snow-covered regions of the Tibetan Plateau. This study presents a systematic analysis of the changes in snow cover and its response to climate change on the Tibetan Plateau during the period 2001-2014 using MODIS daily snow cover products under cloud free conditions and AMSR-E SSM/I daily SWE products. The results indicated that 1) the snow-covered area (SCA) tended to increase at elevations below 2000 m.a.s.l., whereas it decreased at elevations above 2000 m.a.s.l. The SCA exhibited a mean decrease over the entire plateau. 2) The SCD and SWE tended to decrease on the Tibetan Plateau, particularly at high elevations. 3) Decreased snowfall and increased rainfall and temperature are the main reasons for the SCD and SWE decrease over the Tibetan Plateau during the period 2001-2014.4) Snowfall had a positive feedback effect, whereas rainfall and temperature both had negative feedback effects on the attenuation of snow cover. 5) With increasing elevation, the positive feedback of snowfall on snow cover increased significantly, whereas the negative feedback effect of rainfall and temperature also increased.

AB Reliable and timely information on agricultural production is essential for ensuring world food security. Freely available medium-resolution satellite data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel) offer the possibility of improved global agriculture monitoring. Here we develop and test a method for estimating in-season crop acreage using a probability sample of field visits and producing wall-to-wall crop type maps at national scales. The method is illustrated for soybean cultivated area in the US for 2015. A stratified, two-stage cluster sampling design was used to collect field data to estimate national soybean area. The field-based estimate employed historical soybean extent maps from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer to delineate and stratify U.S. soybean growing regions. The estimated 2015 U.S. soybean cultivated area based on the field sample was 341,000 km(2) with a standard error of 23,000 km2. This result is 1.0% lower than USDA's 2015 June survey estimate and 1.9% higher than USDA's 2016 January estimate. Our area estimate was derived in early September, about 2 months ahead of harvest. To map soybean cover, the Landsat image archive for the year 2015 growing season was processed using an active learning approach. Overall accuracy of the soybean map was 84%. The field-based sample estimated area was then used to calibrate the map such that the soybean acreage of the map derived through pixel counting matched the sample -based area estimate. The strength of the sample -based area estimation lies in the stratified design that takes advantage of the spatially explicit cropland layers to construct the strata. The success of the mapping was built upon an automated system which transforms Landsat images into standardized time-series metrics. The developed method produces reliable and timely information on soybean area in a cost-effective way and could be applied to other regions and potentially other crops in an operational mode.

AB Woody plant encroachment of eastern redcedar Juniperus virginiana L, hereafter referred to as "red cedar") into native grasslands in the U.S. Southern Great Plains has significantly affected the production of forage and livestock, wildlife habitats, as well as water, carbon, nutrient and biogeochemical cycles. However, time series of red cedar maps are still not available to document the continuously spatio-temporal dynamics of red cedar encroachment across landscape, watershed and regional scales. In this study, we developed a pixel and phenology-based mapping algorithm, and used it to analyze PALSAR mosaic data in 2010 and all the available Landsat 5/7 data during 1984-2010 with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This pilot study analyzed 4233 images covering >10 counties in the central region of Oklahoma, and generated red cedar forest maps for 2010 and five historical time periods: the late 1980s (1984-1989), early 1990s (1990-1994), late 1990s (1995-1999), early 2000s (2000-2004), and late 2000s (2005-2010). The resultant maps for 2010, the late 2000s, early 2000s, and late 1990s were evaluated using validation samples collected from Google Earth's high-resolution images and geo-referenced field photos. The overall (producer and user) accuracy of these maps ranged from 88% to 96% (88%-93%, and 96%-99%). The resultant maps clearly illustrated an increase in red cedar encroachment within the study area at an annual rate of similar to 8% during 1984-2010. These maps can be used to support additional studies on the driving factors and consequences of red cedar encroachment. This study also demonstrated the potential to trace the historical encroachment of red cedar into grasslands using time series Landsat images and PALSAR data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB An object-based method for automatic iceberg detection from Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images has been developed and applied in the Amundsen Sea, Antarctica. The automatic identification is based on brightness and spatial parameters of the ASAR images at five scale levels, and was verified with manual classification in four areas chosen to represent varying environmental conditions. The presented algorithm works comparatively well with images of the ocean in freezing temperatures and strong wind conditions, common in the Amundsen Sea. The detection rate was 96.2% which corresponds to 93.2% of the icebergs area, for all seasons. The algorithm generated 3.8% errors in the form of 'misses' and 7.0% of 'false alarms', mainly caused by the presence of ice floes.
   The method was applied on 432 radar images acquired in 2011 under different meteorological, oceanographic and sea ice conditions. As an output a map showing the probability of finding icebergs has been created. It shows that high probability coincides with depth contours and indicates a westward drift of the bergs throughout the whole region. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The Himalaya, the world's highest mountain ranges, are home to a large group of glaciers and glacial lakes. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in this region have resulted in catastrophic damages and fatalities in the past decades. The recent warming has caused dramatic glacial lake changes and increased potential GLOF risk in the Himalaya. However, our knowledge on the current state and change of glacial lakes in the entire Himalaya is limited. This study maps the current (2015) distribution of glacial lakes across the entire Himalaya and monitors the spatially-explicit evolution of glacial lakes over five time periods from 1990 to 2015 using a total of 348 Landsat images at 30 m resolution. The results show that 4950 glacial lakes in 2015 cover a total area of 455.3 +/- 72.7 km(2), mainly located between 4000 m and 5700 m above sea level. Himalayan glacial lakes expanded by approximately 14.1% from 1990 to 2015. The changing patterns of supraglacial lakes and proglacial lakes are rather complex, involving both lake disappearance and emergence. Many emergent glacial lakes are found at higher elevations, especially the new proglacial lakes, which have formed as a result of glacier retreat. Spatially heterogeneous changes of Himalayan glacial lakes are observed, with the most significant expansion occurring in the southern slopes of the central Himalaya. Increasing glacier meltwater induced by the Himalayan atmospheric warming is a primary cause for the observed lake expansion. This study provides primary data for future GLOF risk assessments. A total of 118 rapidly expanded glacial lakes are identified as potential vulnerable lakes for the priority of risk assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Several global gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) remote sensing products exist, mainly provided by machine-learning (e.g. MPI-BGC) and semi-empirical (e.g. MODIS) approaches. Process-based approaches have the advantage of representing the atmosphere-vegetation-soil system and associated fluxes as an organic integration, but their sophistication results in a lack of high spatiotemporal resolution continuous products. Targeting this gap, we reported a new set of global 8-day composite 1-km resolution GPP and ET products from 2000 to 2015, using a simplified process-based model, the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). BESS couples atmosphere and canopy radiative transfer, photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, and uses MODIS atmosphere and land data and other satellite data sources as inputs. We evaluated BESS products against FLUXNET observations at site scale (total of 113 sites, 742 site years), and against MPI-BGC products at global scale. At site scale, BESS 8-day Products agreed with FLUXNET observations with R-2 = 0.67 and RMSE = 2.58 gCm(-2) d(-1) for GPP, and R-2 = 0.62 and RMSE = 0.78 mm d(-1) for ET, respectively, and they captured a majority of seasonal variability, about half of spatial variability, and a minority of interannual variability in FLUXNET observations. At global scale, BESS mean annual sum GPP and ET maps agreed with MPI-BGC products with R-2 = 0.93 and RMSE = 229 gC m(-2) y(-1) for GPP, and R-2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 118 mm y(-1) for ET, respectively. Over the period of 2001-2011, BESS quantified the mean global GPP and ET as 122 +/- 25 PgC y(-1) and 65 x 10(3) +/- 11 x 10(3) km(3) y(-1), respectively, with a significant ascending GPP trend by 0.27 PgC y(-2) (p < 0.05), similar to MPI-BGC products as well. Overall, BESS GPP and ET estimates were comparable with FLUXNET observations and MPI-BGC products. The process-based BESS can serve as a set of independent GPP and ET products from official MODIS GPP and ET products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Water clarity, which is commonly and widely represented by the Secchi depth (Z(sd)), is an important quality parameter for all aquatic environments. To evaluate the variation of water clarity of the Bohai Sea (BHS) in the past decade (2003-2014), Z(sd) is derived from MODIS-Aqua ocean color data with an innovative mechanistic model. The resulted Z(sd) product from MODIS is found within 23% differences of match-up in situ measurements that span a range of 2-12 m. Based on this validated MODIS Zsd product of the BHS, valuable findings regarding water clarity of the BHS over the period of 2003-2014 are obtained for the first time. For the central BHS, the climatological mean Z(sd) in August of 2003-2014 (3.9 m) is found strikingly lower than that observed in situ in August of 1982-1983 (8.7 m), 1959-1979 (8-12 m) and 1972-1987 (8-14 m). This implies substantial deterioration of water clarity in the central BHS after the late 1980s, an unpleasant byproduct of rapid economic development in the BHS surrounding regions initiated in the mid-1980s. On the other hand, no significant variations in Z(sd) in the central BHS is detected for the period of 2003-2014, suggesting deterioration of water clarity of this water body is not continued. Results from this effort highlight the value of both the analytically-derived Z(sd) product and satellite ocean color remote sensing in monitoring water quality of coastal seas.

AB This study aims at developing a robust and generic methodology, based on the use of high resolution remote sensing data to provide accurate estimates of maize biomass and yield over large areas (i.e. at regional scale). We propose here a strategy of calibration and spatialization independent as much as possible of in situ measurements and reliable over large areas and under various climatic conditions. For this purpose, we combine the Simple Algorithm For Yield estimates (SAFY) model with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing data from several sensors: Formosat-2, SPOT4-Take5, Landsat-8 and Deimos-1. SPOT4-Take5 experiment conducted in 2013 was designed to simulate the temporal sampling of ESA's Sentinel-2 mission. This study led to a new version of the SAFY model that takes into account the seasonal variation of specific leaf area (SLA) and effective light use efficiency (ELUE). The study takes place in a temperate agrosystem located in the south west of France. The SAFY outputs were validated with local measurements of biomass and yield estimates at both local and regional scales using a multiannual dataset. Good results were obtained for both local biomass (R = 0.98; RRMSE = 14%) and yield (R = 0.81; RRMSE = 8.9%), and for yield estimations at regional scale (R = 0.96; RRMSE = 4.6%). Results also showed that the use of a double logistic function to interpolate Green Area Index (GAI) time series permits to improve the estimations of biomass and yield when remote sensing data are missing. This work demonstrates the potential of high resolution remote sensing data to calibrate a simple crop model without resorting to in situ data and thus foreshadows the future applications using Sentinel-2 data.

AB This paper describes the image acquisition and processing methodology, including surface emissivity and atmospheric corrections, for generating surface temperatures of two active hydrothermal systems in Yellowstone National Park. Airborne thermal infrared (8-12 mu m) images were obtained annually from 2007 to 2012 using a FLIR SC640 thermal infrared camera system. Thermal infrared image acquisitions occurred under clear-sky conditions after sunset to meet the objective of providing high-spatial resolution, georectified imagery for hydrothermal monitoring. Comparisons of corrected radiative temperature maps with measured ground and water kinetic temperatures at flight times provided an assessment of temperature accuracy. A repeatable, time-sequence of images for Hot Spring Basin (2007-2012) and Norris Geyser Basin (2008-2012) documented fracture-related changes in temperature and fluid flow for both hydrothermal systems, highlighting the utility of methods for synoptic monitoring of Yellowstone National Park's hydrothermal systems.

AB Remote sensing (RS)'approaches commonly applied to constrain estimates of gross primary production (GPP) employ greenness-based vegetation indices derived from surface reflectance data. Such approaches cannot capture dynamic changes of photosynthesis rates as caused by environmental stress. Further, applied vegetation indices are often affected by background reflectance or saturation effects. Sun. induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) provides the most direct measure of photosynthesis and has been recently proposed as a new RS approach to improve estimates of GPP and tracing plant stress reactions. This work aims to provide further evidence on the complementary information content of F and its relation to changes in photosynthetic activity compared to traditional RS approaches. We use the airborne imaging spectrometer HyPlant to obtain several F products including red fluorescence (F-687), far-red fluorescence (F-760), F-760 yield (F-760yield) and the ration between F-687 and F-760 (F-ratio). We calculate several vegetation indices indicative for vegetation greenness. We apply a recently proposed F-based semi-mechanistic approach to improve the forward modeling of GPP using F-760 and compare this approach with a traditional one based on vegetation greenness and ground measurements of GPP derived from chamber measurements. In addition, we assess the sensitivity of F-760yield and Fratio for environmental stress. Our results show an improved predictive capability of GPP when using F-760 compared to greenness-based vegetation indices. F-760yield and F-ratio show a strong variability in time and between different crop types suffering from different levels of water shortage, indicating a strong sensitivity of F products for plant stress reactions. We conclude that the new RS approach of F provides complements to the set of commonly applies RS: The use of F-760 improves constraining estimates of GPP while the ratio of red and far-red F shows large potential for tracking spatio-temporal plant adaptation in response to environmental stress conditions.

AB Diurnal variation (DV) of sea surface temperature (SST) plays an important role in air-sea interaction. We have validated four months (January to April 2010) of the version 3 Australian Bureau of Meteorology reprocessed Multifunction Transport SATellite-1R (v3 MTSAT-1R) SST data over the Tropical Warm Pool (TWP) region (90 degrees E to 170 degrees E, 25 degrees S to 15 degrees N) against both drifting buoy and Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) SST data. Validation against collocated point measurements from drifting buoys, under conditions where the surface ocean is well-mixed, shows that overall the v3 MTSAT-1R SSTs perform well with an average bias of 0.00 degrees C and a 0.73 degrees C standard deviation (STD). The average daytime and night-time mean bias is 0.06 degrees C and 0.08 degrees C, respectively. For all hours of the diurnal cycle, the mean biases are within +/- 0.25 degrees C, indicating the consistency between day and night v3 MTSAT-1R data. However, on average, the v3 MTSAT-1R SSTs are overestimated at cold SSTs and underestimated at warm SSTs. Similar results are obtained from validation against the AATSR satellite SSTs but with smaller STD (0.48 degrees C) and smaller average daytime and night-time mean biases (-0.04 degrees C and 0.06 degrees C, respectively). These results indicate that the v3 MTSAT-1R data set is suitable for SST DV investigations and validation of DV models. Using the validated v3 MSTAT-1R data, together with surface wind speed and solar short-wave insolation (SSI) outputs from the Australian Community Climate and Earth-System Simulator - Regional (ACCESS-R) numerical prediction model, we investigate SST DV events over the TWP region. Good correlation is found between DV events and low wind and high SSI conditions. The dominant role of wind speed in SST DV events over the SSI is also revealed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Land surface phenology (LSP) and vegetation growth of the circumpolar north are changing in response to more pronounced warming in the region. We here introduce the first phenology index (PI) based vegetation dynamics product, comprising start (SOS), end (EOS), length of growing season (LOS), and growing season integrated annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), specifically designed for the entire circumpolar north (>45 degrees N) using SPOT VGT data starting from 1999. PI combines the merits of NDVI and normalized difference infrared index (NDII) by taking the difference of squared greenness (from NDVI) and wetness (from NDII) to remove the soil and snow cover dynamics from key vegetation LSP cycles. The results show that the circumpolar vegetation dynamics and their spatial distributions are realistically detected. Further validation based on North American and European deciduous broadleaf, evergreen needleleaf and mixed forests, and wetland flux tower sites shows good agreements between the LSP dates from the circumpolar vegetation dynamics and ground phenology estimates from CO2 flux measurements. The validation also proves that the circumpolar vegetation dynamics product is an improvement over the operational global MODIS Combined Land Cover Dynamics (MCD12Q2) product for the circumpolar region. The results are further compared with the interannual variability of sea ice extent and leading teleconnection patterns in the region. The circumpolar averaged results show that, the growing season integrated annual NDVI is significantly increasing (0.68% year(-1), p = 0.006) and well correlated with the growing season sea ice extent trend (p = 0.007). The circumpolar vegetation dynamics is more related to Polar/Eurasia pattern (i.e., indicator of circumpolar vortex) than to Scandinavian Pattern (SCA) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In view of the considerable scientific and policy importance of the circumpolar region, particularly the arctic ecosystems, the presented circumpolar vegetation dynamics product will greatly contribute to study changes in plant growth, phenology, photosynthetic capacity, and associated feedbacks under climate change.

AB The contrast between the slight increase of Antarctic sea ice and the drastic reduction of Arctic sea ice since the 1970s has been a conundrum to be resolved. Sea ice trajectory tracking with satellite scatterometer data in 2008 shows that ice around Antarctica is pushed offshore by katabatic winds influenced by the continental topography. The ice trajectories reveal that sea ice, grown earlier in the ice season, drifts northward away from the Antarctic continent forming a circumpolar frontal ice zone (FIZ) behind the ice edge. The FIZ thereby consists of sea ice that becomes rougher due to a longer exposure to wind and wave actions, and thicker over time by more ice growth and greater snow accumulation.
   In the Antarctic circumpolar sea ice zone adjacent to the sea ice edge, satellite data in 1999-2009 exhibit a band of strong radar backscatter, which is consistent with the signature of older, thicker, and rougher sea ice with more snow in the FIZ. This sea ice band, as wide as 1000 km, serves as a 'Great Shield,' encapsulating and protecting younger and thinner ice in the internal ice pack. In the young and thin ice region behind the FIZ, ice can grow rapidly as winds continue opening interior areas thereby creating effective "ice factories." In addition, ridging can enhance ice thickness by convergence toward the circumpolar FIZ that is recirculated by westerly winds and currents. During the ice growth season, the FIZ advances until reaching lower-latitude warm waters at a boundary determined by the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front that is constrained by seafloor features. These persistent topographical and bathymetric geological factors help sustain the Antarctic sea ice cover. As such, the behavior of Antarctic sea ice is not a paradox as some have suggested, but instead is consistent with the geophysical characteristics in the southern polar region that starkly contrast to those in the Arctic.

AB We present an algorithm to detect melt onset over Arctic sea ice using high resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from RADARSAT. The algorithm is based on the temporal evolution of the SAR backscatter coefficient (sigma(o)), using an ice type specific threshold approach that also corrects for incidence angle variation. Using 4457 RADARSAT images, the algorithm was applied over sea ice in the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago that low spatial resolution microwave sensors have difficulty resolving, thus generating a new time series of melt onset from 1997 to 2014. Over the 1997-2014 period, the mean annual average melt onset date in the northern CM was on year day 164 (mid-June) with a standard deviation of 4 days. No significant trend for melt onset date was found over the 18-year period. An earlier (later) melt onset was associated with increased (decreased) solar energy absorption (r = 0.64, significant at 95% confidence) and subsequently associated in lighter (heavier) September sea ice coverage in the northern CAA (r = 0.62, significant at 95% confidence). RADARSAT estimates of melt onset were found to be in good agreement but more robust compared to passive microwave and scatterometer estimates over the northern CAA.

AB Sea surface temperature (SST) data are often provided as gridded products, typically at resolutions of order 0.05 degrees from satellite observations, to reduce data volume at the request of data users and facilitate comparison against other products or models. Sampling uncertainty is introduced in gridded products where the full surface area of the ocean within a grid cell cannot be fully observed because of cloud cover. In this paper we parameterise uncertainties in SST as a function of the percentage of clear-sky pixels available and the SST variability in that subsample. This parameterisation is developed from Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) data, but is applicable to all gridded L3U SST products at resolutions of 0.05-0.1 degrees, irrespective of instrument and retrieval algorithm, provided that instrument noise propagated into the SST is accounted for. We also calculate the sampling uncertainty of similar to 0.04 K in global area coverage (GAC) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) products, using related methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Triple collocation (TC) can be used to validate observations of a continuous geophysical target variable when the error-free true value is not known. However, as we show in this study, naive application of TC to categorical target variables results in biased error estimates. The bias occurs because the categorical variable is usually bounded, introducing correlations between the errors and the truth, violating TC's assumptions. We introduce Categorical Triple Collocation (CTC), a variant of TC that relaxes these assumptions and may be applied to categorical target variables. The method estimates the rankings of the three measurement systems for each category with respect to their balanced accuracies (a binary-variable performance metric). As an example application, we estimate performance rankings of landscape freeze/thaw (FT) observations derived from model soil temperatures, in situ station air temperatures and satellite-observed microwave brightness temperatures in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. While rankings vary spatially, in most locations the model-based FT product is ranked the highest, followed by the satellite product and the in-situ air temperature product. These rankings are likely due to a combination of differences in measurement errors between FT products, and differences in scale. They illustrate the value in using a suite of different measurements as part of satellite FT validation, rather than simply treating in-situ measurements as an error-free 'truth'.

AB Developing and improving methods to monitor forest carbon in space and time is a timely challenge, especially for tropical forests. The next European Space Agency Earth Explorer Core Mission BIOMASS will collect synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data globally from employing a multiple baseline orbit during the initial phase of its lifetime. These data will be used for tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) processing, with a vertical resolution of about 20 m, a resolution sufficient to decompose the backscatter signal into two to three layers for most closed-canopy tropical forests. A recent study, conducted in the Paracou site, French Guiana, has already shown that TomoSAR significantly improves the retrieval of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in a high biomass forest, with an error of only 10% at 1.5-ha resolution. However, the degree to which this TomoSAR approach can be transferred from one site to another has not been assessed. We test this approach at the Nouragues site in central French Guiana (ca 100 km away from Paracou), and develop a method to retrieve the top-of-canopy height from TomoSAR. We found a high correlation between the backscatter signal and AGB in the upper canopy layer (i.e. 20-40 m), while lower layers only showed poor correlations. The relationship between AGB and TomoSAR data was found to be highly similar for forests at Nouragues and Paracou. Cross validation using training plots from Nouragues and validation plots from Paracou, and vice versa, gave an error of 16-18% of AGB using 1-ha plots. Finally, using a high-resolution LiDAR canopy model as a reference, we showed that TomoSAR has the potential to retrieve the top-of-canopy height with an error to within 2.5 m. Our analyses show that the TomoSAR-AGB retrieval method is accurate even in hilly and high-biomass forest areas and suggest that our approach may be generalizable to other study sites, having a canopy taller than 30 m. These results have strong implications for the tomographic phase of the BIOMASS spaceborne mission. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB We proposed a new area-based approach to process Lidar point clouds and develop new sets of metrics to improve models dedicated to predict forest parameters. First, we introduced point normalization based on penetration depth below the outer canopy layer to avoid biases introduced by ground normalization and canopy surface heterogeneity during metric computation. Second, we proposed computation of area and volume metrics from canopy surface models computed from both first and last returns to better characterize the 3D plot heterogeneity. The set of proposed metrics were combined with traditional ones, based on point height above ground level, to measure their contribution to models of basal area (BA) and aboveground volume (AGV). The modeling framework included a wide range of forest types, canopy structures and Lidar characteristics. Models were developed for all sites grouped together or separately. In each case, the set of metrics was submitted to a hierarchical clustering process to select the best variables to be included in the models that were further established using a best subset method. Overall, the introduction of the proposed metrics allowed a reduction in models root mean squared error from -0.06% to 19.58% according to forest types and target forest parameters. Best improvements were achieved for broadleaved forests, showing the potential of the proposed metrics to efficiently characterize the structure of such porous forest canopies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB A study is performed to analyze the daily retrieval of soil moisture from the synergy of active and passive microwave data using observations from the ASCAT scatterometer and AMSR-E radiometer. The objective is to identify the information provided by each sensor and to analyze preprocessing methods - such as the day/night average, diurnal difference and microwave polarization difference index for AMSR-E and the incidence angle normalization and backscatter temporal index for ASCAT to maximize the amount of soil moisture information extracted. Additionally, the data fusion and a posteriori synergy methodologies are compared to determine how to optimally exploit this combined information. This study is performed using a neural network (NN) to estimate soil moisture from a set of AMSR-E and ASCAT observations. ERA-interim/Land surface soil moisture fields are used to train the NN as well as to evaluate the performance of the different retrieval input datasets. It is shown that using the AMSR-E 7 GHz, 11 GHz, 19 GHz and 37 GHz channels with the three preprocessing methods highlights various surface contributions in the signal, in particular the soil moisture and surface temperature information, and greatly helps the retrieval in disentangling them. For ASCAT, the synergy effect is less significant and data preprocessed with the two methods analyzed yields very similar information. The information provided by the active and passive microwave sensors is found to be very complementary, such that a soil moisture retrieval using the combined active and passive information shows a significant improvement between 5% and 19% in the temporal correlation and a reduction of the retrieval uncertainty by 7%. The improvement in the spatial structure is smaller with a correlation increase of 2%. It is demonstrated that the choice of synergy method strongly impacts the retrieval improvement that can be achieved. Data fusion methods are shown to be better suited than a posteriori combination methods, due to their ability to exploit information complementarity. These results could help improve future active/passive soil moisture retrievals, such as from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission, through the application of similar preprocessing and synergy methods in order to better extract the soil moisture information provided.

AB Urbanization has eco-environmental consequences; among which are effects on the urban thermal environment, which have drawn extensive attention especially in metropolitan regions having intensive population and high building density. In this study, the variation of the thermal environment during the urbanization process from 2001 to 2009 in the Beijing metropolitan region was evaluated using the spatial Lorenz curve and distribution index. In addition, the effects of landscape composition and spatial configuration on the thermal environment were investigated using correlation analysis and piecewise linear regression. The urban heat island (UHI) was found to be much more significant in summer than in spring, autumn and winter. Furthermore, the magnitude of the urban thermal environment in Beijing has increased during the process of urbanization. The suburban areas of Beijing, including the new urban development zone and ecological conservation zone, have increased the magnitude of the thermal environment. However, the opposite effect has occurred in the center of Beijing, including the core functional zone and urban function extended zone. Landscape types such as built-up areas and barren land make the most significant contribution to the thermal environment, whereas ecological land plays a significant role in mitigating the UHI. When the coverage of ecological land exceeded 70% (25 km(2)) of the total land area, the cooling efficiency of this landscape type was relatively obvious, and the shape index and fragmentation index of landscape configuration both had a significantly positive correlation (0.594 and 0.510 Pearson's coefficients, respectively) with average land surface temperature. The Pearson's coefficient between the ecological land proportion and the average land surface temperature was 0.614 (P < 0.01); this value was higher than that for the effects of the spatial configuration, indicating that landscape composition affects the thermal environment more than does spatial configuration.

AB This study evaluates alternative spatio-temporal approaches for quantitative estimation of daily mean Particulate Matter (PM) concentrations. Both fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) concentrations were estimated over the area of London (UK) for the 2002-2012 time period, using Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) derived from MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer)/AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) synergistic observations at 1 km x 1 km resolution. Relative humidity, temperature and the K-Index obtained from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor were used as additional predictors. High-resolution (100 m x 100 m) local urban land cover and morphology datasets were incorporated in the analysis in order to capture the effects of local scale emissions and sequestration. Spatial (2-D) and spatio-temporal (3-D) kriging were applied to in situ urban PM measurements to investigate their association with satellite-derived AOT while accounting for differences in spatial support. Linear mixed-effects models with day-specific and site-specific random intercepts and slopes were estimated to associate satellite-derived products with lcriged PM concentration and their predictive performance was evaluated.

AB Information on spatial and temporal variability of crop growth status is important for understanding the interaction between plants and environmental conditions. In particular, information at the sub-field level is critical for detecting and combating within-field yield-limiting factors for implementation of precision agriculture. High-resolution optical satellite sensors are useful tools to acquire the necessary information in this regard. This study used multi-temporal RapidEye data to estimate the green effective plant area index (PAH and leaf chlorophyll content of two field crops, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and canola (Brassica napus L.). The objective was to evaluate the capability of RapidEye imagery for detecting within-field variability of crop growth conditions. Field experiments were carried out in northern Ontario over two consecutive years, 2012 and 2013. Several vegetation indices were selected and derived from the RapidEye data to correlate with crop PAI measured using digital hemispherical photography and leaf chlorophyll content index (CCI) measured using a CCM-200 chlorophyll meter. Results showed that the effective PAI and CCI of the two crops were best correlated with different indices. For effective PAI, the modified triangular vegetation index 2 (MTVI2) was the best for spring wheat (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.72 and n = 200) whereas the red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIRE) was the best for canola (R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 0.49 and n = 147). For CCI, the chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI) was the best for spring wheat (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 4.1 and n = 128) whereas the red-edge chlorophyll index (CIRE) was the best for canola (R-2 = 0.33, RMSE = 6.4 and n = 88). The study also confirmed that the combined transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index/optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (TCARI/OSAVI) was satisfactory for spring wheat leaf chlorophyll content estimation when the crop canopy is not sparse. Using selected vegetation indices, RapidEye data can be used to map the within-field variability of crop growth conditions, which is useful for applications in precision agriculture. The reflectance in the red-edge or the green bands is useful in mapping crop leaf chlorophyll variability. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Satellite remote sensing provides a promising way to estimate regional evapotranspiration (ET) in a spatially distributed manner. In this study, an enhanced two-source evapotranspiration model for land (ETEML) is proposed based on a trapezoid framework of the vegetation fractional cover and land surface temperature (VFC/LST) space. In ETEML, a VFC/LST trapezoid space is theoretically defined for each pixel, and a pixel-wise mixed surface temperature decomposition method is proposed. ETEML is based on a two-source scheme, and the crop water stress index (CWSI) concept is applied to parameterize the soil evaporation and the vegetation transpiration separately. The proposed model was applied to the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SIVIACEX) site in central Iowa, USA. Evaluation with a remotely sensed dataset from Landsat was carried out to assess the performance of ETEML. Compared with the tower observations, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) for the ETEML estimated latent heat flux (LE) are, respectively, 49 W/m(2) and 59 W/m(2), comparable to retrieval accuracies published in other studies. Comparison between ETEML and variations on a simpler trapezoid interpolation model (TIM1 and TIM2) indicates that ETEML reduces the subjectivity and uncertainties involved in TIM1 and TIM2. Overall, the results suggest that ETEML is promising and can expand the application of the trapezoid framework-based ET modeling approaches to heterogeneous surfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The ability to estimate and monitor standing dead trees (snags) has been difficult due to their irregular and sparse distribution, often requiring intensive sampling methods to obtain statistically significant estimates. This study presents a new method for estimating and monitoring snags using neighborhood attribute filtered airborne discrete-return lidar data. The method first develops and then applies an automated filtering algorithm that utilizes three dimensional neighborhood lidar point-based intensity and density statistics to remove lidar points associated with live trees and retain lidar points associated with snags. A traditional airborne lidar individual-tree detection procedure is then applied to the snag-filtered lidar point cloud, resulting in stem map of identified snags with height estimates. The filtering algorithm was developed using training datasets comprised of four different forest types in wide range of stand conditions, and then applied to independent data to determine successful snag detection rates. Detection rates ranged from 43 to 100%, increasing as the size of snags increased. The overall detection rate for snags with DBH >= 25 cm was 56% (+/- 2.9%) with low commission error rates. The method provides the ability to estimate snag density and stem map a large proportion of snags across the landscape. The resulting information can be used to analyze the spatial distribution of snags, provide a better understanding of wildlife snag use dynamics, assess achievement of stocking standard requirements, and bring more clarity to snag stocking standards.

AB Aquatic vegetation in shallow waters can absorb nitrogen and phosphorus from eutrophic waters, and effectively control water bloom. However, our knowledge of the interaction between solar radiation and aquatic vegetation is limited. This restricts the protection of aquatic vegetation. This paper proposes a radiative transfer approach for homogeneous aquatic vegetation canopy, based on the theories for terrestrial vegetation and Case II water. The effects of rough water surface and bottom reflection are also taken into consideration. Validations against an independent Monte Carlo model and field experiment data exhibit well consistencies on the bidirectional reflectance of homogeneous aquatic vegetation canopy. As expected, the results for sparse canopy degenerate. This model can be used for canopy modeling of emergent, floating or submerged aquatic vegetation. Potential applications include retrieval of biophysical or biochemical parameters based on hyperspectral data and physical process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an application of a physic-based method that relies on spectral inversion procedures to simultaneously estimate concentrations of water constituents, water column heights (cH) and benthic substrate types in Lake Trasimeno (Italy) from airborne imaging spectrometry. Complex waters of this lake are challenging due to the coexistence of optically-deep turbid waters and of optically-shallow waters, mostly characterised by dense submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) beds. Airborne data acquired on 12 May 2009 by Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) were converted into remote sensing reflectance R-rs(lambda) with the atmospheric correction code ATCOR. A spectral inversion procedure implementing a bio-optical model (namely BOMBER), parameterised with in-situ-data; was-firstly run-to-retrieve concentrations of suspended particulate matter (SPM), chlorophyll-a (chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (i.e. a(CDOM)(440)) in the optically-deep waters. The areas where the retrieved optimisation error was higher than 10% were instead assumed as optically-shallow. In these areas two maps depicting the linear unmixing of three substrate types (i.e., siltyclay, Chara ssp. and other hydrophyte) and the water column heights were produced. The MIVIS-derived products were validated with field data providing a reliable estimation of SPM, chl-a, a(CDOM)(440) and cH (determination coefficients always R-2 > 0.7). SPM concentrations were also similar to a 5.4-km long transect of flow-through turbidity data, and the SAV map was comparable to in situ observations. Generally, the colonisation patterns of SAV were reflecting the spatial distribution of SPM concentrations. In particular, the positive role of Chara on keeping SPM concentrations low was observed. Future research should extend this application to remote sensing data acquired in other seasons to trace the dynamics of SAV and its effect on spatial water clarity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Amazon floodplain lakes range widely in concentrations of optically active constituents (OAC) driven by seasonality in hydrological and biogeochemical processes, but in general they are characterized by high turbidity (NTU from 90 to 1645) compared to coastal waters. In this work, instruments for measuring inherent optical properties (IOPs) of water bodies were evaluated for the first time in floodplain lakes in the lower Amazon River during the falling limb of the hydrograph. Water column profiles of total attenuation and absorption were measured using the Spectral Absorption and Attenuation Meter (AC-S-WETLabs), and of backscattering using Hydroscat. These measurements, however, are subject to uncertainties and require corrections for turbid waters. In this paper, we assessed the implications of scattering correction methods for the absorption tube, proposed by the AC-S manufacturer, in the simulation of the Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs). The closure experiment comparing Hydrolight (Mobley & Sundman, 2001) simulated R-rs and in situ R-rs demonstrated that neither of the corrections was able to thoroughly account for the scattering errors which were propagated to the absorption measurements with AC-S and backscattering with Hydroscat. The three scattering correction methods (Flat, Proportional and "Kirk") either under or overestimated the absorption coefficient that resulted in either under or overestimation of the simulated R-rs. Flat and Proportional Methods resulted in an underestimation of R-rs from 400 to 550 nm and overestimation from 600 to 700 nm, indicating that the assumption of zero (0) absorption in the near infrared does not apply to inland turbid water. The R-rs errors varied also according to water OAC composition. Overall, "Kirk" correction method provided the best results regarding the spectral shape of the R-rs however, failed to account for magnitude. Based on the tuning tests, the errors in spectra magnitude seem to be sensitive to the constant fraction of scattering (CFS) used in the Kirk method. Tests carried out with CFS values varying from 0.18 to 038 indicated that magnitude error can be partially overcomed by tuning CFS according to water composition. Improvements in the scattering correction methods are required in order to obtain reliable IOPs in turbid inland Amazon lakes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Lake Urmia, a hypersaline lake in northwestern Iran, is under threat of drying up. The high importance of the lake's watershed for human life demands a comprehensive monitoring of the watershed's behavior. Spaceborne sensors provide a number of novel ways to monitor the hydrological cycle and its interannual changes. The use of GRACE gravity data makes it possible to determine continental water storage changes and to assess the water budget on monthly to multi-annual time scales. We use satellite altimetry data from ENVISAT and CryoSat-2 to monitor the lake water level. Moreover, we employ optical satellite imagery to determine the surface water extent of the lake repeatedly and at an appropriate time interval.
   Our altimetry results indicate that, on average, the lake has lost 34 +/- 1 cm of its water level every year from 2002 to 2014. The results from satellite imagery reveal a loss of water extent at an average rate of 220 +/- 6 km(2)/yr, which indicates that the lake has lost about 70% of its surface area over the last 14 years. By combining water level from altimetry, surface water extent from satellite imagery and local bathymetry, we ascertain the changes in lake volume. Results indicate that the lake volume has been decreasing at an alarming rate of 1.03 +/- 0.02 km(3)/yr. The water volume of the lake behaves differently from the water storage of the whole basin captured by GRACE Our results show that the onset of a drought in 2007 over this region together with an increase in the rate of groundwater depletion caused a new equilibrium level for water storage of the whole basin. Comparing the results from GRACE and the obtained water volume in the lake with in situ groundwater level data reveals the anthropogenic influences on an accelerated lake desiccation. In fact our monitoring approach raises critical issues regarding water use in the basin and highlights the important role of spaceborne sensors for any urgent or long-term treatment plan.

AB This study was designed to compare the performance - in terms of bias and accuracy - of four different parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric methods in spatially predicting a forest response variable using auxiliary information from remote sensing. The comparison was carried out in simulated and real populations where the value of response variable was known for each pixel of the study region. Sampling was simulated through a tessellation stratified design. Universal kriging and cokriging were considered among parametric methods based on the spatial autocorrelation of the forest response variable. Locally weighted regression and k-nearest neighbor predictors were considered among semiparametric and nonparametric methods based on the information from neighboring sites in the auxiliary variable space. The study was performed from a design-based perspective, taking the populations as fixed and replicating the sampling procedure with 1000 Monte Carlo simulation runs. On the basis of the empirical values of relative bias and relative root mean squared error it was concluded that universal kriging and cokriging were more suitable in the presence of strong spatial autocorrelation of the forest variable, while locally weighted regression and k-nearest neighbors were more suitable when the auxiliary variables were well correlated with the response variable. Results of the study advise that attention should be paid when mapping forest variables characterized by highly heterogeneous structures. The guidelines of this study can be adopted even for mapping environmental attributes beside forestry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ocean-colour remote sensing provides high-resolution and global-coverage of chlorophyll concentration, which can be used to estimate ecological indicators and to study inter-annual and long-term trends in the state of the marine ecosystem. To date, the record of ocean-colour observations is a rich one, including data from a number of sensors spanning more than three decades. The ESA Ocean-Colour Climate Change Initiative has advanced seamless merging of ocean-colour observations from missions during the period 1990s to 2010s. However, comparison of these more recent observations with records from 1970s to 1980s remains a complex undertaking, particularly for absolute values of chlorophyll concentration, primarily due to differences in the sensors. A further impediment to the analysis of the past records is the non-uniform distribution of gaps in the observations, in both time and space dimensions, when data from two or more sensors are compared. Here, we use the CZCS gap distribution from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS, 1978-1986) as a mask to evaluate the impact that missing data may have on the estimation of six ecological indicators, when using the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) data set. Specifically, we evaluate the precision and accuracy of indicators by computing the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and the bias arising purely from missing data. We develop an original resampling method allowing comparison of indicator estimates between SeaWiFS reference time-series and SeaWiFS time-series with CZCS-like gaps. We reduce some of the sampling gaps by applying a linear interpolation procedure, and compute multi-year averages of the indicators for every one-by-one degree pixel where sufficient data are available. Indicators from SeaWiFS reference and SeaWiFS with CZCS-like gaps are compared. Lowest uncertainty arising from missing data is observed in the indicators of annual mean and median chlorophyll concentration (global mean RMSE of 8% and vertical bar bias vertical bar >= 1%), whilst higher uncertainty is recorded for the peak chlorophyll values and the duration of the phytoplankton growing period (global mean RMSE of 33 and 47% respectively and vertical bar bias vertical bar >= 20%). Timing of initiation of the increasing phase of chlorophyll concentration in the seasonal cycle and timing of peak chlorophyll are subject to a global mean RMSE of nearly two months and a bias of two weeks or less. The present quantitative evaluation of uncertainty due to missing data demonstrates that, when pooled to create a nine-year climatology at 8-day temporal resolution, the coverage of CZCS is adequate for many climate-related studies on the marine ecosystem. Phytoplankton annual mean biomass can be estimated with low error in approximately 95% of the global oceans (i.e. regions where the indicators can be estimated with RMSE values of less than 30% and bias within 10%), and the phenological patterns can be estimated with low error in approximately 25% of the global oceans.

AB Accurate characterization of snow-covered area (SCA) and snow water equivalent (SWE) in complex terrain is needed to improve estimation of streamflow timing and volume, and is important for land surface modeling. Direct field observations of SWE, SCA and atmospheric forcing inputs for models of snow accumulation and ablation are typically sparsely sampled in space. Satellite imagery is, therefore, a critical tool for verification and confirmation of snow model estimates of SCA. The Landsat system provides snow-covered area estimates at a spatial resolution of 30 m with a 16-day return interval, while daily estimates of SCA and fractional SCA (f(SCA)) are available at 500 m from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This study describes and tests a linear model to downscale MODIS MOD10A1 f(SCA) (500 m) data to higher-resolution (30 m) spatially explicit binary SCA estimates. The algorithm operates on the assumption that two variables, potential insolation and elevation, control differential ablation of snow cover throughout spring melt at 30 m to 500 m scales. The model downscales daily 500 f(SCA) estimates from MODIS to provide daily SCA estimates at a spatial resolution of 30 m, using limited Landsat SCA for calibration and independent Landsat SCA estimates for validation. Downscaled SCA estimates demonstrate statistically significant improvement from randomly generated model ensembles, indicating that insolation and elevation are dominant factors controlling the snow cover distribution in the semi-arid, mountainous region in southwestern Idaho, USA where this study is performed. Validation is performed with Landsat data not used for calibration, and is also performed using Landsat 500 m aggregate f(SCA) instead of MODIS f(SCA) as an ideal case. Downscaled estimates show reasonable accuracy (test metric outperforms random ensembles at p = 0.01 significance level for multiple ranges of snow cover) with only one calibrated parameter.

AB The integration of satellite image data with forest inventory plot data is a popular approach for mapping forest vegetation over large regions. Several methodological choices regarding spatial scale, mostly related to spatial resolution or grain, can profoundly influence forest maps developed from plot and imagery data. Yet often the consequences of scaling choices are not explicitly addressed. Our objective was to quantify the effects of several scale-related methods on map accuracy for multiple forest attributes, using a variety of diagnostics that address different map characteristics, to help guide map developers and users. We conducted nearest-neighbor imputation over a large region in the Pacific Northwest, USA, to investigate effects of imputation grain (single pixel or kernel); inclusion of heterogeneous plots; accuracy assessment grain and extent; and value of k (k = 1 and k = 5), where k is the number of nearest-neighbor plots. Spatial predictors were from rasters describing climate and topography and a time-series of Landsat imagery. Reference data were from regional forest inventory plots measured over two decades. All analyses were conducted at a spatial resolution of 30 m x 30 m. Effects of imputation grain and heterogeneous plots on map accuracy were small. Excluding heterogeneous plots slightly improved map accuracy and did not lessen the systematic agreement (AC(sys)) between our maps and observed plot data. Accuracy assessment grain strongly influenced map accuracy: maps assessed with a multi-pixel block were much more accurate than when assessed with a single pixel for almost all map diagnostics, but this was an artifact of methods rather than reflecting real differences among maps. Unsystematic agreement (AC(UNS)) between our maps and plots, or random error, improved notably with increasing accuracy assessment extent for all scaling methods, indicating that reliability of most map applications can be improved through coarsening the map grain. Value of k strongly influenced map diagnostics. The k = 5 maps were better than k = 1 maps for local-scale accuracy, but at the cost of reduced AC(sys), and loss of variability and poor areal representation of forest conditions over the study region. The k = 1 maps produced notably better predictions of the least abundant forest conditions (early-successional, late-successional, and broadleaf). None of the scaling methods were optimal for all map diagnostics. Nevertheless, given a variety of diagnostics associated with a range of scaling options, map developers and map users can make informed choices about methods and resulting maps that best meet their particular objectives, and we present some general guidelines in this regard. Most of our findings are applicable to mapping with Landsat data in other forested regions with similar forest inventory data, and to other methods for spatial prediction. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The Alligator Rivers region is located in the wet-dry tropics along the coastal zone of northern Australia and contains Kakadu National Park, which is recognized under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and is a World Heritage listed site. Multiple anthropogenic stressors increasingly affect the floodplains of this region, and baseline information on floodplain inundation dynamics is necessary to manage these threats and develop adaption strategies for sea level rise. This study uses classification tree modeling to combine microwave (ALOS L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) and optical (Landsat Thematic Mapper, TM 5) satellite data with field-sampled aquatic vegetation and depth logger data to predict the seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of aquatic plant cover and extent of inundation in the region. The USGS Landsat TM 5 image archive was sampled between 1985 and 2011 using three seasonal samples per year to create a comprehensive long-term time series of seasonal and inter-annual floodplain inundation extents. Classification accuracy for the inundation mapping was estimated at 86% based on seasonal depth logger data. The mean extent of inundation at the end of the wet season (March/April) was 1784 km(2) (range 2283-1309 km(2)), receding on average to approximately 25% of its extent by August/September. Seasonal inundation patterns exhibit an exponential recession of inundation into 'backswamp' areas on the fringes of the floodplains with hydro-periods on the order of 5 months. The findings of this work significantly improve our understanding of dynamics in this environmentally and culturally unique area and provide a basis for application in other seasonally flooded environments.

AB Estimating primary production at large spatial scales is key to our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Algorithms to estimate primary production are well established and have been used in many studies with success. One of the key parameters in these algorithms is the chlorophyll-normalised production rate under light saturation (referred to as the light saturation parameter or the assimilation number). It is known to depend on temperature, light history and nutrient conditions, but assigning a magnitude to it at particular space-time points is difficult. In this paper, we explore two models to estimate the assimilation number at the global scale from remotely-sensed data that combine methods to estimate the carbon-to-chlorophyll ratio and the maximum growth rate of phytoplankton. The inputs to the algorithms are the surface concentration of chlorophyll, seasurface temperature, photosynthetically-active radiation af the surface of the sea, sea surface nutrient concentration and mixed-layer depth. A large database of in situ estimates of the assimilation number is used to develop the models and provide elements of validation. The comparisons with in situ observations are promising and global maps of assimilation number are produced. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ocean colour remote sensing from sun-synchronous polar orbiting satellites has become well-established as a tool for extracting information on phytoplankton and suspended particulate matter and related processes in regional seas. New data is now becoming available from optical remote sensors on geostationary satellites and provides a much higher temporal resolution, typically an image once or more per hour during daylight compared to once per day. This higher temporal resolution opens up obvious opportunities for dramatically improving the data availability in periods of scattered clouds and for resolving fast processes such as tidal or diurnal variability of phytoplankton or suspended particulate matter. As the science community starts to explore this new data source, further new applications are likely to emerge. However, the geostationary orbit presents also new algorithmic challenges. The coverage of high latitudes is limited by the difficulties of atmospheric correction at very high sensor zenith angle and ultimately by the earth's curvature. Exploitation of the new possibilities of viewing the earth for a range of sun zenith angles over the day also stimulates a need to perform accurate atmospheric correction at high sun zenith angle. Traditional pixel-by-pixel data processing algorithms could be supplemented by information on the temporal coherency of data over the day thus potentially improving data quality, by adding constraints to the inversion problem, or data quality control, by a posteriori analysis of time series. This review assesses the challenges and opportunities of geostationary ocean colour, with emphasis on the data processing algorithms that will need to be improved or developed to fully exploit the potential of this data source. Examples are drawn from recent results using data from the GOCI and SEVIRI sensors. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the accuracy of the surface emissivity generated as an Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) standard product applying the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm. We statistically compared the emissivity values using 61 daytime and 25 nighttime ASTER scenes at the Railroad Valley playa, USA from 2000 to 2012. The spectral emissivity was consistent within +/- 0.007 at bands 13 (10.60 mu m) and 14 (11.30 mu m), although the emissivity at bands 10 to 12 (8.30, 8.65, and 9.10 mu m) varied temporally, probably due to surface condition changes and errors in atmospheric correction. The atmospheric correction based on the climatology data resulted in poor accuracy in TES-retrieved emissivity for nighttime data because the contribution of the atmospheric effect on the at-sensor radiance increases due to decreased surface radiance in nighttime. For the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data, the agreement, which is comparable to the nominal accuracy (= 0.015), between the emissivity based on the day and night ASTER data acquired on the same day suggested that NCEP data is sufficiently accurate to correct for the atmospheric effect on the ASTER data under nominally dry atmospheric condition. Although the spatial scales differ between ASTER data and laboratory data, the satellite and ground emissivity agreed within +/- 0.013. Despite the similarity of the spectral emissivity patterns, the ASTER emissivity was as much as 0.066 lower than the field emissivity at 8.30 mu m due perhaps to the roughness effect on the field emissivity.

AB Satellite altimetry has revolutionised our understanding of ocean dynamics thanks to frequent sampling and global coverage. Nevertheless, coastal data have been flagged as unreliable due to land and calm water interference in the altimeter and radiometer footprint and uncertainty in the modelling of high-frequency tidal and atmospheric forcing. Our study addresses the first issue, i.e. altimeter footprint contamination, via retracicing, presenting ALES, the Adaptive Leading Edge Subwaveform retracker. ALES is potentially applicable to all the pulse-limited altimetry missions and its aim is to retradc both open ocean and coastal data with the same accuracy using just one algorithm. ALES selects part of each returned echo and models it with a classic "open ocean" Brown functional form, by means of least square estimation whose convergence is found through the Nelder-Mead nonlinear optimisation technique. By avoiding echoes from bright targets along the trailing edge, it is capable of retrieving more coastal waveforms than the standard processing. By adapting the width of the estimation window according to the significant wave height, it aims at maintaining the accuracy of the standard processing in both the open ocean and the coastal strip. This innovative retracker is validated against tide gauges in the Adriatic Sea and in the Greater Agulhas System for three different missions: Envisat, Jason-1 and Jason-2. Considerations of noise and biases provide a further verification of the strategy. The results show that ALES is able to provide more reliable 20-Hz data for all three missions in areas where even 1-Hz averages are flagged as unreliable in standard products. Application of the ALES retracker led to roughly a half of the analysed tracks showing a marked improvement in correlation with the tide gauge records, with the rms difference being reduced by a factor of 1.5 for Jason-1 and Jason-2 and over 4 for Envisat in the Adriatic Sea (at the closest point to the tide gauge).

AB This paper focuses on the sensitivity of L-band multi-parameter retrievals across the range of angular measurements available from the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission. The SMOS core algorithm was used to evaluate two-parameter retrieval scenarios including soil moisture and one of either i) vegetation water content, ii) surface roughness, iii) vegetation temperature, or iv) surface soil temperature. For all pairs a range of parameter value combinations were compiled to run the model in forward mode. Subsequently, the resulting angular brightness temperature simulations with two unknown parameters were compared against the brightness temperature response derived from reference simulations using data from the National Airborne Field Experiment 2005 (NAFE'05) in Australia. This paper showed that the two-parameter retrieval accuracy of soil moisture is strongly affected by the surface moisture conditions, the polarization of the brightness temperature data, and the choice of the secondary ancillary parameter to be retrieved. The synthetic analysis demonstrated a tendency for better retrievals from dual-polarized data at large incidence angles (40-50 degrees). Validation with airborne brightness temperature observations at L-band did not demonstrate such a strong angular dependency, although it confirmed that the simultaneous retrieval of soil moisture and vegetation properties is not preferable as opposed to i) soil moisture and surface roughness or ii) soil moisture and surface soil temperature, especially under dry moisture conditions.

AB We extensively exploit advanced Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) techniques for enhanced landslide investigations. We focus on the Ivancich area, Assisi, Central Italy, which is affected by a deep-seated landslide investigated through in-situ surveys. For this area, large data sets of SAR acquisitions were collected by the C-band ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT sensors (from April 1992 to November 2010), and by the X-band radars of the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) constellation (from December 2009 to February 2012). We concentrate on the advanced DInSAR technique referred to as Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach, benefiting of its capability to generate deformation time series at full spatial resolution and from multi-sensor SAR data. This allows us to present one of the first examples for a landslide area of ERS-1/2 - ENVISAT deformation time series exceeding 18 years. The results allowed characterizing the long-term behaviour of the landslide, and identifying sectors of the unstable slope affected by different deformation dynamics. Analysis of the CSK data set, characterized by a reduced revisit time and improved spatial resolution, resulted in a 15-time larger point density with respect to the ERS-ENVISAT measurements, allowing to investigate nearly all the buildings (and, in many cases, portions of buildings) in the landslide area. Lastly, we present an innovative modelling approach based on the effective integration of the DInSAR measurements with traditional geological and geotechnical information, providing deeper insights on the kinematical evolution of the landslide. We consider our analysis a prototype example that can be extended to different geological and geotechnical conditions, providing significant advances in the understanding of ground deformations induced by active landslides.

AB Despite continuous efforts to retrieve aerosol optical depth (ADD) using a conventional 5-channel meteorological imager in geostationary orbit, the accuracy in urban areas has been poorer than other areas primarily due to complex urban surface properties and mixed aerosol types from different emission sources. The two largest error sources in aerosol retrieval have been aerosol type selection and surface reflectance. In selecting the aerosol type from a single visible channel, the season-dependent aerosol optical properties were adopted from long-term measurements of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sun-photometers. With the aerosol optical properties obtained from the AERONET inversion data, look-up tables were calculated by using a radiative transfer code: the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S). Surface reflectance was estimated using the clear sky composite method, a widely used technique for geostationary retrievals. Over East Asia, the AOD retrieved from the Meteorological Imager showed good agreement, although the values were affected by cloud contamination errors. However, the conventional retrieval of the AOD over Hong Kong was largely underestimated due to the lack of information on the aerosol type and surface properties. To detect spatial and temporal variation of aerosol type over the area, the critical reflectance method, a technique to retrieve single scattering albedo (SSA), was applied. Additionally, the background aerosol effect was corrected to improve the accuracy of the surface reflectance over Hong Kong. The AOD retrieved from a modified algorithm was compared to the collocated data measured by AERONET in Hong Kong. The comparison showed that the new aerosol type selection using the critical reflectance and the corrected surface reflectance significantly improved the accuracy of AODs in Hong Kong areas, with a correlation coefficient increase from 0.65 to 0.76 and a regression line change from T-MI [basic algorithm] = 0.41 tau (AERONET) + 0.16 to tau(MI [new algorithm]) = 0.70 tau(AERONET) + 0.01.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) radiatives transfer models of vegetation canopies are increasingly used to study the reflective properties of specific land cover types and to interpret satellite-based remote sensing observations of such environments. In doing so, most 3D canopy reflectance models simplify the structural representation of individual tree crowns, for example, by using a single ellipsoidal envelope or a series of cubic volumes (known as voxels) to approximate the actual crown shape and the 3D distribution of scatterers therein. Often these tree abstractions ignore or simplify the woody architecture as well. Focusing on broad-leaved Savanna trees, this study investigates the impact that architectural simplifications may have on the fidelity of simulated satellite observations at the bottom of the atmosphere for a variety of spatial resolutions, spectral bands, as well as viewing and illumination geometries. The typical uncertainty associated with vicarious calibration efforts, i.e., 5%, is used as the quality objective for the simulated bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs). Our results indicate that the size of the voxel as well as the spectral, viewing, and illumination conditions drive the BRF bias at a given spatial resolution. The simulation of remote sensing data at medium spatial resolution is not affected by canopy abstractions except in the near-infrared (NIR) for cases where woody structures are omitted. Here, the BRF simulations of the abstract tree crowns exceeded the 5% tolerance limit even at spatial resolutions coarser than 125 m. For high-resolution satellite imagery, i.e., for nominal pixel sizes of 1 x 1 m(2) or finer, local BRF biases can be 10 times greater than the 5% tolerance criterion. Both positive and negative local biases are possible depending on the relative weights of the single-collided, single-uncollided, and multiple-collided BRF components. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Forest cover loss and bare ground gain from 2006 to 2010 for the conterminous United States (CONUS) were quantified at a 30 m spatial resolution using Web-Enabled Landsat Data available from the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) (http://landsatusgs.gov/WELD.php). The approach related multi-temporal WELD metrics and expert-derived training data for forest cover loss and bare ground gain through a decision tree classification algorithm. Forest cover loss was reported at state and ecoregional scales, and the identification of core forests' absent of change was made and verified using LiDAR data from the GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimetry System) instrument. Bare ground gain correlated with population change for large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) outside of desert or semi-desert environments. GoogleEarth (TM) time-series images were used to validate the products. Mapped forest cover loss totaled 53,084 km(2) and was found to be depicted conservatively, with a user's accuracy of 78% and a producer's accuracy of 68%. Excluding errors of adjacency, user's and producer's accuracies rose to 93% and 89%, respectively. Mapped bare ground gain equaled 5974 km(2) and nearly matched the estimated area from the reference (GoogleEarth (TM)) classification; however, user's (42%) and producer's (49%) accuracies were much less than those of the forest cover loss product. Excluding errors of adjacency, user's and producer's accuracies rose to 62% and 75%, respectively. Compared to recent 2001-2006 USGS National land Cover Database validation data for forest loss (82% and 30% for respective user's and producer's accuracies) and urban gain (72% and 18% for respective user's and producer's accuracies), results using a single CONUS-scale model with WELD data are promising and point to the potential for national-scale operational mapping of key land cover transitions. However, validation results highlighted limitations, some of which can be addressed by improving training data, creating a more robust image feature space, adding contemporaneous Landsat 5 data to the inputs, and modifying definition sets to account for differences in temporal and spatial observational scales. The presented land cover extent and change data are available via the official WELD website (ftp://weldftp.cr.usgs.gov/CONUS_5Y_LandCover/ftp://weldftp.cr.usgs.gov/CONUS_5Y_LandCover/).

AB An innovative phenology-based classification method was developed to map corn and soybean in multiple years using training data limited to a single year. Unlike traditional mapping efforts mainly based on multi-spectral image data, the classifier employed by this method takes phenological metrics as the major input. Phenological metrics represent crop characteristics related to crop calendar and progress such as the timing of emergence, maturity, harvest, etc. While considerable inter-annual variability exists among remotely sensed images from different years, phenological characteristics of each crop type are relatively consistent for a long period of time. Therefore, it is assumed that phenological metrics can be used to classify crop types in multiple years with the same rules, which is a valuable feature not possessed by traditional classification inputs.
   The classification method was tested in mapping corn and soybean, which are two dominant summer crop types in the central United States, and the experiment was carried out for Doniphan County, Kansas during years 2006-2010. Over 100 Landsat TM and ETM + images in this period were utilized and phenological metrics were calculated froth Enhanced Vegetation Index time series using techniques including image segmentation and curve-fitting. Several sets of input variables, ranging from multi-spectral features of selected dates, which are widely used in traditional mapping efforts, to phenological metrics and derived measurements such as accumulated temperature, were tested using a random forest classifier. When the classifier was trained by reference data collected in the same year as that of remotely sensed data, most sets of input variables yielded accuracies higher than 88%. However, when the training data used by the classifier were obtained in a year different from the mapping years, only input sets containing phenological metrics were able to achieve acceptable accuracies greater than 80%. The use of phenological metrics as classification inputs avoids the restrictive requirements of a large ground reference dataset enabling frequent and routine crop mapping without repeated collection of reference data.

AB Reflectance data from multiseasonal SPOT-5 imagery was combined with monthly measures of water levels collected in the Rhone river delta (Camargue) in 2005 and 2006. Classification tree and regression models using monthly values of 17 multispectral indices and 4 bands, as well as their seasonal variations, were used for predicting the presence and levels of water, independently of vegetation type and density in shallow marshes. Accuracy of the classification model was estimated by cross-validation and by calculating the percentage of correctly classified pixels on the resulting maps using an independent sampling. Goodness-of-fit of the regression model was assessed by calculating the coefficient of correlation between predicted and observed values. Predictive accuracy of both models was estimated by calculating NRMSE for the independent validation sample. Regression model robustness was also tested using Scheffe post-hoc analyses on the residuals. Biophysical parameters of Camargue marsh vegetation were used to interpret misclassifications and model deficiency. Both models were composed of a single variable consisting of a multispectral index using the mid-infrared band. The resulting classification tree provided a cross-validation accuracy of 76% and a map validation accuracy of 83%. With an R = 0.5, the regression model predicted water level with a 6-cm precision up to 20 cm of water depth. For both approaches, the predictive power of model was most affected by close canopy. This study highlights the usefulness of data mining for long-term monitoring of wetland hydrology based on multispectral indices using the mid-infrared band. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Organizations concerned with human rights are increasingly using remote sensing as a tool to improve their detection of human rights violations. However, as these organizations have transitioned to human-rights monitoring campaigns conducted over large regions and extended periods of time, current methods of using high-resolution sensors and manpower-intensive analyses have become prohibitive. We present an algorithmic approach that uses Landsat ETM+, coupled with high-resolution sensors, as a system for the detection of the destruction of villages in arid environments. This algorithm capitalizes on Landsafs historical archive and systematic observations by constructing a historic spectral baseline for each village in the study area. This allows for the automated detection of a potentially destroyed village with each new overpass of the sensor. The algorithm is based on Landsat's near-infrared band, which is a persistent indicator of the destruction of plant cell structure, and is less affected by atmospheric scattering than Landsat's visible bands. Comparison of this product with a U.S. government database documenting destroyed villages shows high levels of accuracy among villages in the study area. We evaluated algorithm performance in Darfur, Sudan for the 2004 calendar year. In the study area, the Landsat estimates were within 16% of the U.S. government database, demonstrating a functioning system to alert human rights practitioners to a potential destruction of villages.

AB Absorption of ultraviolet radiation (UV, 280-400 nm) by chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) precedes a host of light-sensitized surface ocean processes relevant to global climate. These include photo- and biogeochemical cycling of organic material, release of sulfur and carbon-containing gases to the atmosphere, and the photoprotection of marine microorganisms. Synoptic CDOM absorption data in the UV is highly desired yet difficult to estimate by satellite methods as the atmosphere interferes with direct detection of water-leaving UV radiance. The absorption spectrum of CDOM is typically modeled as an exponential function in which a spectral slope parameter, S. describes the rate of decrease in absorption with increase in wavelength. Significant functional relationships are observed in aquatic environments between S and the CDOM absorption coefficient at 443 nm, a(CDOM)(443). In this paper, we use a large, systematic dataset of spectroscopic CDOM measurements from the U.S. CO2/CLIVAR Repeat Hydrography Survey to examine the relationship between S and a(CDOM)(443) as a means to model a(CDOM)(lambda) in the UV from ocean color. Our resultant model predicts a(CDOM)(lambda) at wavelengths from 325 to 412 nm from the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved and detrital materials (CDM) at 443 nm, a(CDM)(443), retrieved by an existing semi-analytical ocean color algorithm. Expected agreement (near 1:1) with the training dataset was achieved (r(2) = 0.71-0.85, p = 0, n = 127). Considering inherent satellite data uncertainties as well as the model's limitations in regions with potential terrestrial influence, good correspondence between modeled and in situ values was observed during independent validation with open ocean CDOM data, such as from BIOSOPE (r(2) p < 0.05, n = 29). The model has immediate application in global scale assessments of photochemical rate processes and CDOM cycling in the open ocean due to its simplicity and optimization using a large base of field data (>7500 samples) from diverse Case I waters.

AB Photosynthetic production of organic matter by microscopic oceanic phytoplankton fuels ocean ecosystems and contributes roughly half of the Earth's net primary production. For 13 years, the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) mission provided the first consistent, synoptic observations of global ocean ecosystems. Changes in the surface chlorophyll concentration, the primary biological property retrieved from SeaWiFS, have traditionally been used as a metric for phytoplankton abundance and its distribution largely reflects patterns in vertical nutrient transport. On regional to global scales, chlorophyll concentrations covary with sea surface temperature (SST) because SST changes reflect light and nutrient conditions. However, the ocean may be too complex to be well characterized using a single index such as the chlorophyll concentration. A semi-analytical bio-optical algorithm is used to help interpret regional to global SeaWiFS chlorophyll observations from using three independent, well-validated ocean color data products; the chlorophyll a concentration, absorption by CDM and particulate backscattering. First, we show that observed long-term, global-scale trends in standard chlorophyll retrievals are likely compromised by coincident changes in CDM. Second, we partition the chlorophyll signal into a component due to phytoplankton biomass changes and a component caused by physiological adjustments in intracellular chlorophyll concentrations to changes in mixed layer light levels. We show that biomass changes dominate chlorophyll signals for the high latitude seas and where persistent vertical upwelling is known to occur, while physiological processes dominate chlorophyll variability over much of the tropical and subtropical oceans. The SeaWiFS data set demonstrates complexity in the interpretation of changes in regional to global phytoplankton distributions and illustrates limitations for the assessment of phytoplankton dynamics using chlorophyll retrievals alone.

AB Accurate estimate of biomass and its changes at local to regional scales are important for a better understanding of ecosystem function, biodiversity and sustainability. In this study we explored the forest biomass prediction and dynamic monitoring from Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) waveform metrics at different key map scales. NASA's Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data were acquired in Penobscot County, Maine, USA, during August 2003 and 2009 airborne campaigns in the New England region. Field data were collected in 2003, and 2009 to 2011. Regression models developed at the scale of footprint were applied to all LVIS waveforms within the two study sites: Howland Forest (HF) and Penobscot Experiment Forest (PEF). The effect of forest disturbances on LVIS biomass prediction models was investigated. Two types of models, i. e. combined model without consideration of disturbances and disturbance-specific models were developed and compared. Field data from nested field plots of 0.25 ha, 0.5 ha and 1.0 ha were used to evaluate the averaged, footprint-level (similar to 0.03 ha, 20 m diameter) estimates in these plots. The results demonstrate that: 1) prediction model at the scale of individual LVIS footprints is reliable when the geolocations of the measured footprints were determined by DGPS with a best accuracy of 0.5-1.0 m. 2) The differences between biomass prediction models for disturbed and undisturbed forests were statistically significant (p < 0.001) at the scale of footprint, and the disturbance-specific models performed slightly better (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 27.9 Mg.ha(-1), and relative error of 22.6%) than the combined model (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 31.0 Mg.ha(-1), 25.1%). 3) The evaluation using field plot data showed that the predictions of biomass were improved markedly with the increase of plot sizes from 0.25 ha to 1.0 ha and that the effect of disturbance was not strong. At 1.0 ha plot-level, both disturbance-specific and combined models agreed well with field estimates (R-2 = 0.91, 23.1 Mg.ha(-1), 16.1%; and R-2 = 0.91, 22.4 Mg.ha(-1), 15.6%). 4) Sensitivity analysis on levels of variation and error to footprint density suggests that a certain density of LVIS footprints is required for biomass mapping. The errors were minimized when footprint coverage approached about 50% of the area of 1.0 ha plots (16 footprints). 5) By applying the footprint-level models developed from 2009 LVIS data to both 2009 and 2003 LVIS data, the change of biomass from 2003 to 2009 could be assessed. The average annual biomass reduction rate from forest disturbance at two sites is -7.0 Mg.ha(-1) and -6.2 Mg.ha(-1), the average annual biomass accumulation from regrowth is +4.4 Mg.ha(-1) and +5.2 Mg.ha(-1), respectively.

AB Establishing a link between the optical and biogeochemical properties of near-shore waters continues to be a challenge for both riverine and estuarine areas worldwide due to terrestrial influences. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of an inversion algorithm for the extraction of riverine and estuarine CDOM properties at global scales. Our CDOM evaluation focused on five aspects: I) the range of worldwide CDOM levels, 2) spatial distribution patterns, (3) climatic influences, (4) influences of land cover change, and (5) seasonal effects. The study locations consisted of the estuarine and coastal regions of 10 major rivers spread across five continents. Our approach was to examine the QAA-CDOM algorithm by extracting CDOM properties from hundreds of EO-1 Hyperion images acquired during the last decade (2001-2011). Preliminary results showed that CDOM absorption coefficients at 440 nm within the 10 selected rivers exhibited a broad range (0.02-72 m(-1)). Spatial CDOM distribution patterns showed many plumes dispersing from source areas (e.g. adjacent terrestrial vegetated areas) along the direction of flow. Seasonal variations in CDOM levels are also evident (i.e. 0.5-4.0 m(-1)) as illustrated by the January, April, August and October images of the Volga River. CDOM levels also appeared to trend upward with the increase in forest coverage (i.e. terrestrial influence) within the watersheds studied over the last decade. Our results strongly suggest that the algorithm is effective in distinguishing riverine and estuarine CDOM levels affected by factors such as global biogeography, climate conditions and regional land surface processes.

AB In this research, we present a novel technique to monitor cyanobacterial bloom using remote sensing measurements. We have used a multi-band quasi analytical algorithm that determines phytoplankton absorption coefficients, a(phi)(lambda), from above surface remote sensing reflectance, R-rs(lambda). In situ data including remote sensing reflectance, phytoplankton pigment concentration, and absorption coefficients of optically active constituents in the water were collected from highly turbid and productive aquaculture ponds. These shallow (<1.5 m) ponds in northwestern Mississippi, USA, were used for channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus aquaculture and had high nitrogen and phosphorus loading rates from manufactured feeds added to ponds to promote rapid fish growth. These practices resulted in high phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a concentrations = 59.4-1376.6 mg m(-3)) with communities dominated by filamentous, gas-vacuolate cyanobacteria. A novel technique was developed to further decompose the a(phi) to obtain phycocyanin absorption coefficient, a(PC), at 620 nm, a primary peak of phycocyanin absorption spectrum. Validation of the model produced mean and median absolute relative errors of 36.2% and 22.0%. Overall, the model performance was higher in the higher range of PC concentration (>150 mu g l(-1)). Results demonstrate that the new approach will be suitable for quantifying phycocyanin concentration in cyanobacteria dominated turbid productive waters. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Based on multi-sensor optical remote sensing techniques, more than 80 medium and high spatial resolution satellite images were used for studying the turbidity patterns of Danube Delta waters. During a selected 4-year temporal coverage (2006 to 2009), the turbidity gradients were simultaneously analyzed in the delta plain lakes and in the Black Sea western-northwestern coastal zone. Two distinct, but complementary, methodologies for retrieving turbidity were employed, one for the lakes and the other for the coastal zone. After comparing the turbidity satellite-derived turbidity products with in-situ measurements, the inter-comparability of the products was independently verified. Then, through an integrative analysis, the initial hypothesis of turbidity control by the Danube River inputs was tested in both areas (Delta plain and coastal zone). Seasonal turbidity patterns were identified together with the mechanisms responsible for its important temporal and spatial variability. Reciprocal contributions derived from the association of multi-scale satellite products were highlighted. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation phenology is the study of the timing of seasonal events that are considered to be the result of adaptive responses to climate variations on short and long time scales. In the field of remote sensing of vegetation phenology, phenological metrics are derived from time series of optical data. For that purpose, considerable effort has been specifically focused on developing noise reduction and cloud-contaminated data removal techniques to improve the quality of remotely-sensed time series. Comparative studies between time series composed of satellite data acquired under clear and cloudy conditions and from radiometric data obtained with high accuracy from ground-based measurements constitute a direct and effective way to assess the operational use and limitations of remote sensing for predicting the main plant phenological events. In the present paper, we sought to explicitly evaluate the potential use of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data for monitoring the seasonal dynamics of different types of vegetation cover that are representative of the major terrestrial biomes, including temperate deciduous forests, evergreen forests, African savannah, and crops. After cloud screening and filtering, we compared the temporal patterns and phenological metrics derived from in situ NDVI time series and from MODIS daily and 16-composite products. We also evaluated the effects of residual noise and the influence of data gaps in MODIS NDVI time series on the identification of the most relevant metrics for vegetation phenology monitoring. The results show that the inflexion points of a model fitted to a MODIS NDVI time series allow accurate estimates of the onset of greenness in the spring and the onset of yellowing in the autumn in deciduous forests (RMSE <= one week). Phenological metrics identical to those provided with the MODIS Global Vegetation Phenology product (MDC12Q2) are less robust to data gaps, and they can be subject to large biases of approximately two weeks or more during the autumn phenological transitions. In the evergreen forests, in situ NDVI time series describe the phenology with high fidelity despite small temporal changes in the canopy foliage. However, MODIS is unable to provide consistent phenological patterns. In crops and savannah, MODIS NDVI time series reproduce the general temporal patterns of phenology, but significant discrepancies appear between MODIS and ground-based NDVI time series during very localized periods of time depending on the weather conditions and spatial heterogeneity within the MODIS pixel. In the rainforest, the temporal pattern exhibited by a MODIS 16-day composite NDVI time series is more likely due to a pattern of noise in the NDVI data structure according to both rainy and dry seasons rather than to phenological changes.

AB Aerosol scattering reflectance is the most uncertain term to be determined in the atmospheric correction of satellite remote sensing data. The values in the visible bands depend on the aerosol scattering ratios (the epsilon spectrum). The epsilon value in the Near-infrared (NIR) band is estimated on the dark pixel assumption of the water-leaving reflectance in the two NIR bands and then the epsilon spectrum is determined from the aerosol models. This assumption usually becomes invalid for turbid coastal waters, leading to lost regions in the satellite imagery masked by the failure of the atmospheric correction. A new approach was developed to accurately estimate epsilon from turbid coastal waters. This method is based on the idea that the aerosol scattering reflectance and the epsilon values can be obtained from the known water-leaving reflectance of in situ measurements. The water-leaving reflectance is determined from the choice of a look-up table of the water-leaving reflectance based on the Angstrom law of the candidate aerosol scattering reflectance using the best non-linear least squares fit function. In this approach, the entire epsilon spectra can be obtained and used to determine the two closest aerosol models which are used to interpolate the actual epsilon values. It is demonstrated that the results from matching the entire spectra are more robust than that obtained from using only one epsilon value. The performance of the approach was evaluated using the simulated reflectance at the top of the atmosphere, the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery, and in situ measured aerosol optical thickness. This approach is based on the assumption of the aerosol scattering reflectance following the Angstrom law instead of the standard dark pixel assumption, named as the ENLF model. This new assumption is valid for both Case I and Case 2 waters, even over terrestrial regions. Therefore, the ENLF model provides a potential approach for a universal algorithm of the atmospheric correction of satellite remote sensing data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB As a spatial source of forest data, the forest stand is the basic unit for forest management and planning. Computerized segmentation of a diverse range of remote sensing material has been studied for delineating stands in various forest types, but is relatively rare under tropical conditions. In line with REDD+, which advocates sustainable forest management in tropical developing countries, we report here on the delineation of forest stands in Laos using data from Airborne Laser Scanning, Airborne CIR and ALOS AVNIR-2. Rather than using the spectral layers alone, the segmentation was applied to wall-to-wall maps of predicted values from empirical models that retrieve forest stem volume and basal area. The homogeneity of 96 sets of segmentation categorized according to the hierarchical mean sizes of the segments was evaluated quantitatively in terms of the AIC(var) index and qualitatively by eye. The results show that the quality and performance of the empirical models are duly reflected in the quality and performance of the segmentation, and that the most competitive delineations are provided by models that involve ALS. Finally, the future prospects for using this empirical model-based segmentation approach to detect and quantify deforestation, or even forest degradation, and thereby to provide further support for the development of REDD methodology, are discussed.

AB Developed as a quantitative measurement of fire intensity, fire radiative power (FRP) and the potential applications to smoke plume injection heights, are currently limited by the pixel resolution of a satellite sensor. As a result, this study, the first in a two-part series, develops a new sub-pixel-based calculation of fire radiative power (FRPf) for fire pixels detected at 1 km(2) nominal spatial resolution by the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire detection algorithm (collection 5), which is subsequently applied to several large wildfire events in California. The methodology stems from the heritage of earlier bi-spectral retrievals of sub-pixel fire area and temperature. However, in the current investigation, a radiative transfer model is incorporated to remove solar effects and account for atmospheric effects as a function of Earth-satellite geometry at 3.96 and 11 mu m (MODIS fire detection channels). The retrieved sub-pixel fire (flaming) area is assessed via the multispectral, high-resolution data (3-50 m) obtained from the Autonomous Modular Sensor (AMS), flown aboard the NASA Ikhana unmanned aircraft. With fire sizes ranging from 0.001 to 0.02 km(2), pixel-level fire area comparisons between MODIS and AMS are highly variable, regardless of the viewing zenith angle, and show a low bias with a modest correlation (R=0.59). However, when lower confidence fire pixels and point-spread-function effects (fire hot spots on the pixel edge) are removed, the correlation becomes much stronger (R=0.84) and the variability between MODIS and AMS is reduced. To account for these random errors via averaging, two clustering techniques are employed and the resulting AMS and MODIS comparisons of fire area, after correcting for overlapping MODIS pixels, are even more encouraging (R=0.91). Drawing from the retrieved fire area and temperature, the FRPf is calculated and compared to the current MODIS pixel area-based FRP. While the two methods are strongly correlated (R=0.93), the FRPf, in combination with retrieved fire cluster area, allows a large fire burning at a low intensity to be separated from a small fire burning at a high intensity. Similarly, the flux of FRPf over the retrieved fire area can be calculated, allowing for improved estimates of smoke plume injection heights in modeling studies and creating potential applications for the future VIIRS and GOES-R fire detection algorithms.

AB Using reflectance data and water sample data from 75 stations in several eutrophic lakes of East China (Lake Taihu, Lake Gehu, Lake Dongjiu) between 23 April and 3 May 2010, we evaluated several recently proposed remote sensing algorithms to estimate chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla, 1.0-42 mu g/L) and phycocyanin pigment concentrations (PC, 0.1-7.7 mu g/L). These lakes experience phytoplankton blooms of the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa every year due to eutrophication. It was found that after local tuning of the algorithm parameterizations, most algorithms yielded acceptable results for Chla retrievals while accurate PC retrievals were more challenging due to changing species composition (PC:Chla ratios) and low PC concentrations. For the data ranges in the study region, the best Chla algorithm yielded RMSErel (Relative Root Mean Square Error) of similar to 46% (R-2=0.92, n=75) and the best PC algorithm yielded RMSErel of similar to 83% (R-2=0.88, n=75). Based on these observations, it is recommended that local tuning of algorithm parameters should be performed for remote sensing applications, and future efforts should emphasize on application of the algorithms to satellite data.

ID WATER CLARITY
AB Satellite-based remote monitoring programs of regional lake water quality largely have relied on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) owing to its long image archive, moderate spatial resolution (30 m), and wide sensitivity in the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, despite some notable limitations such as temporal resolution (i.e., 16 days), data pre-processing requirements to improve data quality, and aging satellites. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on Aqua/Terra platforms compensate for these shortcomings, although at the expense of spatial resolution. We developed and evaluated a remote monitoring protocol for water clarity of large lakes using MODIS 500 m data and compared MODIS utility to Landsat-based methods. MODIS images captured during May-September 2001, 2004 and 2010 were analyzed with linear regression to identify the relationship between lake water clarity and satellite-measured surface reflectance. Correlations were strong (R-2 = 0.72-0.94) throughout the study period; however, they were the most consistent in August, reflecting seasonally unstable lake conditions and inter-annual differences in algal productivity during the other months. The utility of MODIS data in remote water quality estimation lies in intra-annual monitoring of lake water clarity in inaccessible, large lakes, whereas Landsat is more appropriate for inter-annual, regional trend analyses of lakes >= 8 ha. Model accuracy is improved when ancillary variables are included to reflect seasonal lake dynamics and weather patterns that influence lake clarity. The identification of landscape-scale drivers of regional water quality is a useful way to supplement satellite-based remote monitoring programs relying on spectral data alone. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Given the pace and scale of urban expansion in many parts of the globe, urban environments are playing an increasingly important role in daily quality-of-life issues, ecological processes, climate, material flows, and land transformations. Remote sensing has emerged as a powerful tool to monitor rates and patterns of urban expansion, but many early challenges - such as distinguishing new urban land from bare ground - remain unsolved. To deal with the high temporal and spatial variability as well as complex, multi-signature classes within settlements, this paper presents a new approach that exploits multi-seasonal information in dense time stacks of Landsat imagery using a multi-date composite change detection technique. The central premise of the approach is that lands within/near urban areas have distinct temporal trajectories both before and after change occurs, and that these lead to characteristic temporal signatures in several spectral regions. The method relies on a supervised classification that exploits training data of stable/changed areas interpreted from Google Earth images, and a 'brute force' approach of providing all available Landsat data as input, including scenes with data gaps due to the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) problem. Three classification algorithms (maximum likelihood, boosted decision trees, and support vector machines) were tested for their ability to monitor expansion across five time periods (1988-1995,1996-2000,2001-2003,2004-2006,2007-2009) in three study areas that differ in size, eco-climatic conditions, and rates/patterns of development. Both the decision trees and support vector machines outperformed the maximum likelihood classifier (overall accuracy of 90-93%, compared to 65%), but the decision trees were superior at handling missing data. Adding transformed features such as band metrics to the Landsat data stack increased accuracy 1-4%, while experiments with a reduced number of features (designed to mimic noisy or missing data) led to a drop in accuracy of 1-9%. The methodology also proved particularly effective for monitoring pen-urbanization outside the urban core, capturing >98% of village settlements. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Studies of global hydrologic cycles, carbon cycles and climate change are greatly facilitated when. global estimates of evapotranspiration (E) are available. We have developed an air-relative-humidity-based two-source (ARTS) E model that simulates the surface energy balance, soil water balance, and environmental constraints on E. It uses remotely sensed leaf area index (L-ai) and surface meteorological data to estimate E by: 1) introducing a simple biophysical model for canopy conductance (G(c)), defined as a constant maximum stomatal conductance g(smax) of 12.2 mm s(-1) multiplied by air relative humidity (R-h) and L-ai (G(c) = g(srnax) x R-h X L-ai); 2) calculating canopy transpiration with the G(c)-based Penman-Monteith (PM) E model; 3) calculating soil evaporation from an air-relative-humidity-based model of evapotranspiration (Yan & Shugart, 2010); 4) calculating total E (E-0) as the sum of the canopy transpiration and soil evaporation, assuming the absence of soil water stress; and 5) correcting E-0 for soil water stress using a soil water balance model.
   This physiological ARTS E model requires no calibration. Evaluation against eddy covariance measurements at 19 flux sites, representing a wide variety of climate and vegetation types, indicates that daily estimated E had a root mean square error = 0.77 mm d(-1). bias = -0.14 mm d(-1), and coefficient of determination, R-2 = 0.69. Global, monthly, 0.5 degrees-gridded ARTS E simulations from 1984 to 1998, which were forced using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer Lai data, Climate Research Unit climate data, and surface radiation budget data, predicted a mean annual land E of 58.4 x 10(3) km(3). This falls within the range (58 x 10(3)-85 x 10(3) km(3)) estimated by the Second Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP-2: Dirmeyer et al., 2006). The ARTS E spatial pattern agrees well with that of the global E estimated by GSWP-2. The global annual ARTS E increased by 15.5 mm per decade from 1984 to 1998, comparable to an increase of 9.9 mm per decade from the model tree ensemble approach (Jung et al., 2010). These comparisons confirm the effectivity of the ARTS E model to simulate the spatial. pattern and climate response of global E. This model is the first of its kind among remote-sensing-based PM E models to provide global land E estimation with consideration of the soil water balance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Plant phenology characterises the seasonal cyclicity of biological events such as budburst, flowering, fructification, leaf senescence and leaf fall. These biological events are genetically pre-determined but also strongly modulated by climatic conditions, particularly temperature, daylength and water availability. Therefore, the timing of these events is considered as a good indicator of climate change impacts and as a key parameter for understanding and modelling vegetation climate interactions. In situ observations, empirical or bioclimatic models and remotely sensed time-series data constitute the three possible ways for monitoring the timing of plant phenological events. Remote sensing has the advantage of being the only way of surface sampling at high temporal frequency and, in the case of satellite-based remote sensing, over large regions. Nevertheless, exogenous factors, particularly atmospheric conditions, lead to some uncertainties on the seasonal course of surface reflectance and cause bias in the identification of vegetation phenological events. Since 2005, a network of forest and herbaceous sites has been equipped with laboratory made NDVI sensors to monitor the temporal dynamics of canopy structure and phenology at an intra-daily time step. In this study, we present recent results obtained in several contrasting biomes in France, French Guiana, Belgium and Congo. These sites represent a gradient of vegetation ecosystems: the main evergreen and deciduous forest ecosystems in temperate climate region, an evergreen tropical rain forest in French Guiana, an herbaceous savanna ecosystem in Congo, and a succession of three annual crops in Belgium. In this paper, (1) we provide an accurate description of the seasonal dynamics of vegetation cover in these different ecosystems (2) we identify the most relevant remotely sensed markers from NDVI time-series for determining the dates of the main phenological events that characterize these ecosystems and (3) we discuss the relationships between temporal canopy dynamics and climate factors. In addition to its importance for phenological studies, this ground-based Network of NDVI measurement provides data needed for the calibration and direct validation of satellite observations and products.

AB Automatic matching of images from two different times is a method that is often used to derive glacier surface velocity. Nearly global repeat coverage of the Earth's surface by optical satellite sensors now opens the possibility for global-scale mapping and monitoring of glacier flow with a number of applications in, for example, glacier physics, glacier-related climate change and impact assessment, and glacier hazard management. The purpose of this study is to compare and evaluate different existing image matching methods for glacier flow determination over large scales. The study compares six different matching methods: normalized cross-correlation (NCC), the phase correlation algorithm used in the COSI-Corr software, and four other Fourier methods with different normalizations. We compare the methods over five regions of the world with different representative glacier characteristics: Karakoram, the European Alps, Alaska, Pine Island (Antarctica) and southwest Greenland. Landsat images are chosen for matching because they expand back to 1972, they cover large areas, and at the same time their spatial resolution is as good as 15 m for images after 1999 (ETM + pan). Cross-correlation on orientation images (CCF-O) outperforms the three similar Fourier methods, both in areas with high and low visual contrast. NCC experiences problems in areas with low visual contrast, areas with thin clouds or changing snow conditions between the images. CCF-O has problems on narrow outlet glaciers where small window sizes (about 16 pixels by 16 pixels or smaller) are needed, and it also obtains fewer correct matches than COSI-Corr in areas with low visual contrast. COSI-Corr has problems on narrow outlet glaciers and it obtains fewer correct matches compared to CCF-O when thin clouds cover the surface, or if one of the images contains snow dunes. In total, we consider CCF-O and COSI-Corr to be the two most robust matching methods for global-scale mapping and monitoring of glacier velocities. If combining CCF-O with locally adaptive template sizes and by filtering the matching results automatically by comparing the displacement matrix to its low pass filtered version, the matching process can be automated to a large degree. This allows the derivation of glacier velocities with minimal (but not without!) user interaction and hence also opens up the possibility of global-scale mapping and monitoring of glacier flow.

AB Although remotely sensed data have been used in public health studies, these studies are often limited by the critical choice that has to be made in data selection: either using data with high spatial but low temporal resolution, or data with high temporal but low spatial resolution. This choice creates significant limitations for time-dependent epidemiological studies, since it is often essential to have datasets with high spatial and temporal resolution. Effectively synthesizing high temporal resolution imagery with high spatial resolution imagery can potentially ease this limitation. To this end, we conducted an experiment by creating a series of simulated ASTER datasets by fusing ASTER and MODIS data with the STARFM image fusion model. These simulated datasets are then used to derive the following urban environmental variables: normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, and land surface temperature. These variables are used to quantitatively examine the effects of urban environmental characteristics on West Nile Virus dissemination in Los Angeles County, California, where the epidemic was most prevalent in the United States in 2007. Mosquito surveillance data were collected from the weekly summary reports published in the California West Nile Virus website. A spatial-temporal analysis of WNV dissemination was conducted by synthesizing remote sensing variables and mosquito surveillance records. We focused on assessment of WNV risk areas in July through September due to data sufficiency of tested-positive mosquito pools. Moderate- and high-risk areas of WNV infections in mosquitoes were identified for five selected time windows, i.e., epidemiological weeks 30-31, 32-33, 34-35, 36-37, and 38-39. The results show that elevation and urban built-up conditions were negatively associated with the WNV propagation, while LST positively correlated with viral transmission. NDVI was not significantly associated with WNV transmission during the studied time intervals. San Fernando Valley was found to be the most vulnerable to mosquito infections of WNV within the City of Los Angeles. With the complementation of high-spatial resolution ASTER and high-temporal resolution MODIS images, the fused image datasets allow for estimating environmental parameters at desired epidemiological weeks. This paper provides important insights into how high temporal resolution remote sensing imagery might be used to study time-dependant events in public health, especially in the operational surveillance and control of vector-borne or other epidemic diseases.

AB The synoptic quantification of crop gross primary productivity (GPP) is essential for studying carbon budgets in croplands and monitoring crop status. In this study, we applied a recently developed model, which relates crop GPP to a product of total crop chlorophyll content and incoming photosynthetically active radiation, for the remote estimation of GPP in two crop types (maize and soybean) with contrasting canopy architectures and leaf structures. The objective of this study was to evaluate performances of twelve vegetation indices used for detecting different vegetation biophysical characteristics, in estimating GPP of rainfed and irrigated crops over a period from 2001 through 2008. Indices tested in the model exhibited strong and significant relationships with widely variable GPP in each crop (GPP ranged from 0 to 19 gC/m(2)/d for soybean and 0 to 35 gC/m(2)/d for maize), however, they were species-specific. Only three indices, which use MERIS red edge and NIR spectral bands (i.e. red edge chlorophyll index, MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index and red edge NDVI), were found to be able to estimate GPP accurately in both crops combined, with root mean square errors (RMSE) below 3.2 gC/m(2)/d. It was also shown that two indices, red edge chlorophyll index and red edge NDVI with a red edge band around 720 nm, were non-species-specific and yielded a very accurate estimation of GPP in maize and soybean combined, with RMSEs below 2.9 gC/m(2)/d and coefficients of variation below 21%.

AB This study assesses the MODIS standard Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/Albedo product, and the daily Direct Broadcast BRDF/Albedo algorithm at tundra locations under large solar zenith angles and high anisotropic diffuse illumination and multiple scattering conditions. These products generally agree with ground-based albedo measurements during the snow cover period when the Solar Zenith Angle (SZA) is less than 70 degrees. An integrated validation strategy, including analysis of the representativeness of the surface heterogeneity, is performed to decide whether direct comparisons between field measurements and 500-m satellite products were appropriate or if the scaling of finer spatial resolution airborne or spaceborne data was necessary. Results indicate that the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) are less than 0.047 during the snow covered periods for all MCD43 albedo products at several Alaskan tundra areas. The MCD43 1-day daily albedo product is particularly well suited to capture the rapidly changing surface conditions during the spring snow melt. Results also show that a full expression of the blue sky albedo is necessary at these large SZA snow covered areas because of the effects of anisotropic diffuse illumination and multiple scattering. In tundra locations with dark residue as a result of fire, the MODIS albedo values are lower than those at the unburned site from the start of snowmelt. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellites offer the opportunity to determine the spatial distribution of aerosol properties. In this study the AATSR (Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer) Dual View (ADV) algorithm is applied for observing aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Eastern China. A preliminary selection of representative aerosol models was made by a comparison of ADV retrieval for a range of models with AERONET data. The selected fine-, and coarse-mode aerosol models were subsequently used in the ADV retrievals over a wider area where no AERONET data was available. In addition to AOD at wavelengths of 0.555 and 0.659 mu m, a mixing ratio (the contribution of fine mode aerosol to the total aerosol extinction) was retrieved from the AATSR data for 2008. The results show a seasonal variation of the AODs and mixing ratios over the areas with strong anthropogenic activity; over rural areas the AODs and mixing ratios are low throughout the year. Over urban areas the lowest AODs were observed during the winter, and the highest during the summer. During the winter the fine mode aerosol mixing ratios were higher than during other seasons.

AB The highly variable rainfall in the arid and semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Western Africa drives both surface water availability and vegetation cover. Recent studies have established linkages between rainfall and vegetation cover at local to regional scales, but no study related yet remote sensing derived rainfall and vegetation cover to the available surface water. A new dataset based on SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) represents surface water bodies (SWB) in the arid and semi-arid regions of sub-Saharan Western Africa. Water bodies represent the integrated hydrological response of a catchment, and changes in their spatial extent involve complex interactions at the catchment scale. We analyzed time series of remotely sensed vegetation cover, rainfall and surface water extent for the period 1999-2008, and could detect and statistically demonstrate the links between these biophysical variables. Our findings for two regions in Mali and Burkina Faso suggest that vegetation cover is positively related to the amount of available surface water for those catchments that are mainly covered by annual plants. The observed relationships between remotely sensed variables allow developing ecological indicators that can indicate short-term changes in arid and semi-arid ecosystems at local to regional scales.

AB The Congo Basin is the world's third largest in size (similar to 3.7 million km(2)), and second only to the Amazon River in discharge (similar to 40,200 m(3) s(-1) annual average). However, the hydrological dynamics of seasonally flooded wetlands and floodplains remains poorly quantified. Here, we separate the Congo wetland into four 3 degrees x 3 degrees regions, and use remote sensing measurements (i.e., GRACE, satellite radar altimeter, GPCP, JERS-1, SRTM, and MODIS) to estimate the amounts of water filling and draining from the Congo wetland, and to determine the source of the water. We find that the amount of water annually filling and draining the Congo wetlands is 111 km(3), which is about one-third the size of the water volumes found on the mainstem Amazon floodplain. Based on amplitude comparisons among the water volume changes and timing comparisons among their fluxes, we conclude that the local upland runoff is the main source of the Congo wetland water, not the fluvial process of river-floodplain water exchange as in the Amazon. Our hydraulic analysis using altimeter measurements also supports our conclusion by demonstrating that water surface elevations in the wetlands are consistently higher than the adjacent river water levels. Our research highlights differences in the hydrology and hydrodynamics between the Congo wetland and the mainstem Amazon floodplain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, launched in November 2009, provides global maps of soil moisture and ocean salinity by measuring the L-band (1.4 GHz) emission of the Earth's surface with a spatial resolution of 40-50 km. Uncertainty in the retrieval of soil moisture over large heterogeneous areas such as SMOS pixels is expected, due to the non-linearity of the relationship between soil moisture and the microwave emission. The current baseline soil moisture retrieval algorithm adopted by SMOS and implemented in the SMOS Level 2 (SMOS L2) processor partially accounts for the sub-pixel heterogeneity of the land surface, by modelling the individual contributions of different pixel fractions to the overall pixel emission. This retrieval approach is tested in this study using airborne L-band data over an area the size of a SMOS pixel characterised by a mix Eucalypt forest and moderate vegetation types (grassland and crops), with the objective of assessing its ability to correct for the soil moisture retrieval error induced by the land surface heterogeneity. A preliminary analysis using a traditional uniform pixel retrieval approach shows that the sub-pixel heterogeneity of land cover type causes significant errors in soil moisture retrieval (7.7%v/v RMSE, 2%v/v bias) in pixels characterised by a significant amount of forest (40-60%). Although the retrieval approach adopted by SMOS partially reduces this error, it is affected by errors beyond the SMOS target accuracy, presenting in particular a strong dry bias when a fraction of the pixel is occupied by forest (4.1%v/v RMSE, -3.1%v/v bias). An extension to the SMOS approach is proposed that accounts for the heterogeneity of vegetation optical depth within the SMOS pixel. The proposed approach is shown to significantly reduce the error in retrieved soil moisture (2.8%v/v RMSE, -03%v/v bias) in pixels characterised by a critical amount of forest (40-60%), at the limited cost of only a crude estimate of the optical depth of the forested area (better than 35% uncertainty). This study makes use of an unprecedented data set of airborne L-band observations and ground supporting data from the National Airborne Field Experiment 2005 (NAFE'05), which allowed accurate characterisation of the land surface heterogeneity over an area equivalent in size to a SMOS pixel.

AB Aerial survey provides the user with great flexibility in terms of the geometry of sensing and the timing of measurements, but mosaicking individual aerial images to produce an extensive coverage remains a problem. Empirical methods based on normalising individual images to a common standard are used widely to create visually acceptable mosaics. However, the effect of these methods on quantitative estimation of land surface properties is unknown. An existing method for atmospherically correcting an aerial image mosaic involves fitting a regression model using pixels from the overlapping edges of adjacent flightlines. Here, we demonstrate a new method of atmospherically correcting an aerial image mosaic, based on use of an additional orthogonal flightline. The two methods were compared by using the two image mosaics to calculate vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, ARVI), which were then used to predict leaf area index, which was known in detail from ground survey. The second method was found to have lower uncertainty for all three vegetation indices tested. ARVI was found to be the most robust of the three when applied across multiple flightlines, regardless of the method of atmospheric correction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Results from the application of Persistent Scatterers Interferometry in Lisbon Metropolitan Area revealed two previously unknown subsiding urban areas: one (Laranjeiras) is located in the center of Lisbon; another (Vialonga) is to be found toward the North, in an industrial region crossed by Lisbon's main highway and railway lines. The two subsiding sectors are bordered by sharp velocity gradients, and the subsidence pattern appears partially delimited by mapped geologic faults. Surface geology and urbanization alone are unable to explain the phenomena. In the Vialonga area, the historical record of water pore pressure shows a clear decline of the levels (up to 65 m in 27 years), providing evidence of over-exploitation of groundwater resources. Limited information from wells drilled inside and outside the subsidence area points to a spatial correlation between the subsidence and the water pressure levels, and suggests that faults could be acting as hydraulic barriers in the aquifer system. The surface subsidence detected is probably caused by compaction of a clay-rich Oligocene-aged aquitard, led by over-exploitation of adjacent aquifers. The same Oligocene aquitard layer is present in the Laranjeiras area, immediately bellow a multi-layered sand-clay-limestone Miocene aquifer, but further work is needed to diagnose the possibility of over-exploitation of groundwater here. In this work we were able to independently confirm the PSI results, by comparing autonomous PSI results processed for the same geographical areas, and by comparing PSI with leveling and continuous GPS derived subsidence velocities, whose close match provided further ground validation of the space-borne PSI technique.

AB Disturbed forests may need decades to reach a mature stage and optically-based vegetation indices are usually poorly suited for monitoring purposes due to the rapid saturation of the signal with increasing canopy cover. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data provide an alternate monitoring approach since the backscattered microwave energy is sensitive to the vegetation structure. Images from two regions in Spain and Alaska were used to analyze SAR metrics (cross-polarized backscatter and co-polarized interferometric coherence) from regrowing forests previously affected by fire. TerraSAR-X X-band backscatter showed the lowest sensitivity to forest regrowth, with the average backscatter increasing by 1-2 dB between the most recent fire scar and the unburned forest. Increased sensitivity (around 3-4 dB) was observed for C-band Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture (ASAR) backscatter. The Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) L-band backscatter presented the highest dynamic range from unburned to recently burned forests (approximately 8 dB). The interferometric coherence showed low sensitivity to forest regrowth at all SAR frequencies. For Mediterranean forests, five phases of forest regrowth were discerned whereas for boreal forest, up to four different regrowth phases could be discerned with L-band SAR data. In comparison, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provided reliable differentiation only for the most recent development stages. The results obtained were consistent in both environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Snow cover and glaciers are sensitive indicators of the environment. The vast spatial coverage of remote sensing data, coupled with the tough conditions in areas of interest has made remote sensing a particularly useful tool in the field of glaciology. Compared to optical images, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are hardly influenced by clouds. This is important because glacial areas are usually under cloud cover. The Dongkemadi glacier in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau was selected as the study area for this paper. We use polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) image for classification on and around the glacier. The contrast between ice and wet snow is remarkable, but it is difficult to distinguish the ice from the ground on SAR images due to similar backscatter characteristics in former research. In our study, we found that this distinction can be achieved by target decomposition. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are performed to classify the glacier areas using the selected features. The glacial areas are classified into six parts: wet snow, ice, river outwash, soil land, rocky land and others. The PolSAR-Target decomposition-SVMs (PTS) method is proven to be efficient, with an overall classification accuracy of 91.1% and a kappa coefficient of 0.875. Moreover, 86.63% of the bare ice and 96.76% of the wet snow are correctly classified. The classification map acquired using the PTS method also helps to determine the snow line, which is an important concept in glaciology. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Home Reef volcano (Tonga, Southwest Pacific Ocean) erupted in August 2006. Initially a submarine eruption it quickly evolved into a subaerial event upon the formation of an ephemeral island.
   Remote sensing data from different sensors including MODIS, ASTER. EO-1 ALI and Landsat-7 ETM+ were used to analyze the event, focusing on the plumes of discolored water, ocean chlorophyll-a concentration (OCC) and sea surface temperature.
   An early classification system for the plumes was devised based on spectral properties and point of origin. Plumes originated at the volcano were named Type-I and those associated to the pumice rafts Type-II.
   Anomalies in ocean chlorophyll-a concentration, measured using MODIS data, were analyzed and a large bloom, presumably dominated by Trichodesmium sp. was identified. The bloom, which contributed to OCC values 17 times higher than the background, was spatially and temporally coincident with a Type-I plume of discolored water. The OCC increase appears to have been caused by a combined effect of both ocean fertilizations by the subsurface volcanic plume and rising sea surface temperatures.
   The Home Reef event offers a good candidate for a case of ocean enrichment by a submarine volcano and highlights the need for continuous monitoring of the eruptions even after the end of the explosive, more spectacular stages. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Traditionally, it is necessary to pre-process remote sensing data to obtain top of canopy (TOC) reflectances before applying physically-based model inversion techniques to estimate forest variables. Corrections for atmospheric, adjacency, topography, and surface directional effects are applied sequentially and independently, accumulating errors into the TOC reflectance data, which are then further used in the inversion process. This paper presents a proof of concept for demonstrating the direct use of measured top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance data to estimate forest biophysical and biochemical variables, by using a coupled canopy-atmosphere radiative transfer model. Advantages of this approach are that no atmospheric correction is needed and that atmospheric, adjacency, topography, and surface directional effects can be directly and more accurately included in the forward modelling.
   In the case study, we applied both TOC and TOA approaches to three Norway spruce stands in Eastern Czech Republic. We used the SLC soil-leaf-canopy model and the MODTRAN4 atmosphere model. For the TOA approach, the physical coupling between canopy and atmosphere was performed using a generic method based on the 4-stream radiative transfer theory which enables full use of the directional reflectance components provided by SLC. The method uses three runs of the atmosphere model for Lambertian surfaces, and thus avoids running the atmosphere model for each new simulation. We used local sensitivity analysis and singular value decomposition to determine which variables could be estimated, namely: canopy cover, fraction of bark, needle chlorophyll, and dry matter content. TOC and TOA approaches resulted in different sets of estimates, but had comparable performance. The TOC approach, however, was at its best potential because of the flatness and homogeneity of the area. On the contrary, the capacities of the TOA approach would be better exploited in heterogeneous rugged areas. We conclude that, having similar performance, the TOA approach should be preferred in situations where minimizing the pre-processing is important, such as in data assimilation and multi-sensor studies.

AB We examined the relationships between two satellite-derived vegetation indices and foliar delta N-15 values obtained from dominant canopy species in a set of tree islands located in the Everglades National Park in South Florida, USA. These tree islands constitute important nutrient hotspots in an otherwise P-limited wetland environment. Foliar delta N-15 values obtained from a previous study of 17 tree islands in both slough (perennially wet) and prairie (seasonally wet) locations served as a proxy of P availability at the stand level. We utilized five cloud-free SPOT 4 multispectral images (20 m spatial resolution) from different times of the seasonal cycle to derive two atmospherically corrected vegetation indices: the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI), averaged for each tree island. NDWI, which incorporates a shortwave infrared (SWIR) band that provides information on leaf water content, showed consistently higher linear fits with island foliar delta N-15 values than did NDVI. In addition, NDWI showed greater variation throughout the seasonal cycle than did NDVI, and was significantly correlated with average water stage, which suggests that the SWIR band captures important information on seasonally variable water status. Tree islands in slough locations showed higher NDWI than prairie islands during the dry season, which is consistent with higher levels of transpiration and nutrient harvesting and accumulation for perennially wet locations. Overall, the results suggest that water availability is closely related to P availability in subtropical tree islands, and that NDWI may provide a robust indicator of community-level water and nutrient status.

AB This paper is concerned with the detection of fronts in satellite images. We focus on some specific textured patterns of clouds that are visible on Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) images and generated at the so-called "sea breeze front". This is the limit of the penetration of the sea breeze inland. The sea breeze circulation is a phenomenon that arises when land and sea surface temperatures reveal strong variations. This generates a landward wind that creates a cloud-free area starting from the coast line and ending at the sea breeze front. With the new geostationary meteorological sensors like MSG, this band of cloud-free area can clearly be seen. The automatic analysis of the sea breeze front with such image sensors (instead of using local measurements) is then of great importance. It has the precious advantage to extract huge amount of data and to get rid of the use of local sensors. Unfortunately, from an image processing point of view, this front appears as the limit of a very textured area. It is sometimes disturbed by clouds located in higher layers of the atmosphere. Due to this complexity, conventional detection methods issued from computer vision are not adapted. In this paper we propose an approach that automatically detects fronts in images and we apply this framework to the sea breeze fronts. The methodology is based on the well-known active contour method (or "snake") issued from the computer vision community. The specific textures involved as well as the transparency phenomena are dealt with some properties of the wavelet decomposition of the images. This decomposition enables to compute several criteria related to the presence or not of a front that are combined using the Dempster-Shafer theory. The validation of our approach is done on synthetic and real data. It is important to outline that the presented theoretical framework is not only devoted to the detection of the sea breeze front but can also be used to detect any others textured patterns.

AB Regression has been widely applied in Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing to spatially extend predictions of total aboveground biomass (TAGB) and other biophysical properties over large forested areas. Sample (field) plot size has long been considered a key sampling design parameter and focal point for optimization in forest surveys, because of its impact on sampling effort and the estimation accuracy of forest inventory attributes. In this study, we demonstrate how plot size and co-registration error interact to influence the estimation of LiDAR canopy height and density metrics, regression model coefficients, and the prediction accuracy of least-squares estimators of TAGB. We made use of simulated forest canopies and synthetic LiDAR point clouds, so that we could maintain strict control over the spatial scale and complexity of forest scenes, as well as the magnitude and type of planimetric error inherent in ground-reference and LiDAR datasets. Our results showed that predictions of TAGB improved markedly as plot size increased from 314 (10 m radius) to 1964 m(2) (25 m radius). The co-registration error (spatial overlap) between ground-reference and LiDAR samples negatively impacted the estimation of LiDAR metrics, regression model fit, and the prediction accuracy of TAGB. We found that larger plots maintained a higher degree of spatial overlap between ground-reference and LiDAR datasets for any given GPS error, and were therefore more resilient to the ill effects of co-registration error compared to small plots. The impact of co-registration error was more pronounced in tall, spatially heterogeneous stands than short, homogeneous stands. We identify and briefly discuss three possible ways that LiDAR data could be used to optimize plot size, sample selection, and the deployment of GPS resources in forest biomass surveys.

AB As of writing in mid-2010, both Landsat-5 and -7 continue to function, with sufficient fuel to enable data collection until the launch of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) scheduled for December of 2012. Failure of one or both of Landsat-5 or -7 may result in a lack of Landsat data for a period of time until the 2012 launch. Although the potential risk of a component failure increases the longer the sensor's design life is exceeded, the possible gap in Landsat data acquisition is reduced with each passing day and the risk of Landsat imagery being unavailable diminishes for all except a handful of applications that are particularly data demanding. Advances in Landsat data compositing and fusion are providing opportunities to address issues associated with Landsat-7 SLC-off imagery and to mitigate a potential acquisition gap through the integration of imagery from different sensors. The latter will likely also provide short-term, regional solutions to application-specific needs for the continuity of Landsat-like observations. Our goal in this communication is not to minimize the community's concerns regarding a gap in Landsat observations, but rather to clarify how the current situation has evolved and provide an up-to-date understanding of the circumstances, implications, and mitigation options related to a potential gap in the Landsat data record.

AB Rockslides have a high socioeconomic and environmental Importance in many countries. Norway is particularly susceptible to large rockslides due to its many fjords and steep mountains One of the most dangerous hazards related with rock slope failures are tsunamis that can lead to large loss of life It is therefore very important to systematically identify potential unstable rock slopes Traditional landslide monitoring techniques are expensive and time consuming. Differential satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an invaluable tool for land displacement monitoring Improved access to time series of satellite data has led to the development of several innovative multitemporal algorithms. Small baseline (SB) methods are based on combining and inverting a set of unwrapped interferograms that are computed with a small perpendicular baseline in order to reduce spatial phase decorrelation Another well proven technique is the persistent scatterer interferometric method (PSI) that is based on analysis of persistent point targets In this paper, we apply both approaches to study several rockslide sites in Troms County in the far north of Norway. Moreover, we take the opportunity to address the difference and similarities between the SB and the PSI multitemporal InSAR methods for displacement studies in rural terrain.

AB On 16 June 2006 an overpass of IKONOS coincided with the emplacement of an active block-and-ash flow fed by a lava dome collapse at Merapi Volcano (Java. Indonesia) It was the first moving pyroclastic flow recorded on a satellite image. The very high-spatial resolution of the image indicated the extent and Impact of pyroclastic material that was deposited during and prior to the day of image acquisition. A number of features associated with the hazardous block-and-ash flows emplaced in narrow, deep gorges were mapped. interpreted and analysed The high-spatial-resolution IKONOS imagery worked extremely well for identifying pyroclastic deposits. The block-and-ash flow and surge deposits recognized in the IKONOS images include (1) several channel-confined flow lobes and tongues in the box-shaped gorge: (2) thin ash-cloud surge deposit and knocked-down trees in constricted areas on both slopes of the gorge: (3) fan-like overbank deposits on the Gendol-Tlogo interfluves from which flows were re-routed in the Tlogo minor valley; (4) massive overbank flow lobes on the right bank of the Gendol River, which destroyed the village of Kaliadem 0.5 km from the main channel. A small part of this flow was re-channelled into the Opak tributary valley. The high-resolution IKONOS images also helped us to identify geomorphic obstacles that enabled flows to ramp up and spill out from the sinuous channel, as flow avulsion. Flow avulsions are dangerous as the redirect flows to unexpected areas away from the main channel. Valley fills from previous deposits, channel bends, and anthropogenic barriers in the channel (locally known as Sabo dams) influence the down valley passage of the flows. Sabo dams, originally built to ameliorate the effect of high sediment load streams, caused block-and-ash flows to avulse of the containing channel, and devastate populated areas (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved

AB Lack of data often limits understanding and management of biodiversity in forested areas. Remote sensing imagery has considerable potential to aid in the monitoring and prediction of biodiversity across many spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we explored the possibility of defining relationships between species diversity indices and Landsat ETM+ reflectance values for Hyrcanian forests in Golestan province of Iran. We used the COST model for atmospheric correction of the imagery. Linear regression models were implemented to predict measures of biodiversity (species richness and reciprocal of Simpson indices) using various combinations of Landsat spectral data. Species richness was modeled using the band set ETM5, ETM7, DV1, wetness and variances of ETM1, ETM2 and ETM5 (adjusted R-2 = 0.59, RMSE = 1.51). Reciprocal of Simpson index was modeled using the band set NDVI, brightness, greenness, variances of ETM2. ETM5 and ETM7 (adjusted R-2=0.459 RMSE = 1.15). The results demonstrated that spectral reflectance from Landsat can be used to effectively model tree species diversity. Predictive map derived from the presented methodology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest. The methodology also facilitates the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies in northern Iran. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) is a crucial parameter in the study of climatology and hydrology. Active microwave remote sensing is one of the most promising techniques for estimating the distribution of SWE at high spatial resolutions in large areas. Development of reliable and accurate inversion techniques to recover SWE is one of the most important tasks in current microwave researches. However, a number of snow pack properties, including snow density, particle size, crystal shape. stratification, ground surface roughness and soil moisture, affect the microwave scattering signals and need to be properly modeled and exploited. In this paper, we developed a multi-layer, multi-scattering model for dry snow based on recent theoretical advances in snow and surface modeling. In the proposed multi-layer model, Matrix Doubling method is used to account for scattering from each snow layer; and Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) is incorporated into the model to describe surface scattering. Comparisons were made between the model predictions and field observations from NASA Cold Land Processes Field Experiment (CLPX) during Third Intensive Observation Period (IOP3) and SARALPS-2007 field experiment supported by ESA. The results indicated that model predictions were in good agreement with field observations. With the confirmed confidence, the analyses on multiple scattering. scatterer shape, and snow stratification effects were further made based on the model simulations. Furthermore, a parameterized snow backscattering model with a simple form and high computational efficiency was developed using a database generated by the multiple-scattering model. For a wide range of snow and soil properties, this parameterized model agrees well with the multiple-scattering model, with the root mean square error 0.20 dB, 0.24 dB and 0.43 dB for VV, HH and VH polarizations, respectively. This simplified model can be useful for the development of SWE retrieval algorithm and for fast simulations of radar signals over snow cover in land data assimilation systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study focuses on the potential of satellite hyperspectral imagery to monitor vegetation biophysical and biochemical characteristics through narrow-band indices and different viewing angles. Hyperspectral images of the CHRIS/PROBA sensor in imaging mode 1 (5 observation angles, 62 bands, 410-1005 nm) were acquired throughout a two-year period for a Mediterranean ecosystem fully covered by the semi-deciduous shrub Phlomis fruticosa. During each acquisition, coincident ecophysiological field measurements were conducted. Leaf area index (LAI), leaf biochemical content (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids) and leaf water potential were measured. The hyperspectral images were corrected for coherent noises, cloud and atmosphere, in order to produce ground reflectance images. The reflectance spectrum of each image was used to calculate a variety of vegetation indices (VIs) that are already published in relevant literature. Additionally, all combinations of the 62 bands were used in order to calculate Normalized Difference Spectral Indices (NDSI(x,y)) and Simple Subtraction Indices (SSI(x,y)). The above indices along with raw reflectance and reflectance derivatives were examined for linear relationship with the ground-measured variables and the strongest relationships were determined. It is concluded that higher observation angles are better for the extraction of biochemical indices. The first derivative of the reflectance spectra proved to be very useful in the prediction of all measured variables. In many cases, complex and improved spectral indices that are proposed in the literature do not seem to be more accurate than simple NDSIs Such as NDVI. Even traditional broadband NDVI is proved to be adequate in LAI prediction, while green bands seem also very useful. However, in biochemical estimation narrow bands are necessary. Indices that incorporate red, blue and IR bands, such as PSRI, SIPI and mNDVI presented good performance in chlorophyll estimation, while CRI did not show any relevance to carotenoids and WI was poorly correlated to water potential. Moreover, analyses indicated that it is very important to use a near red-edge band (701 nm) for effective chlorophyll index design. SSIs that incorporate 701 nm with 511 or 605 nm showed best performance in chlorophyll determination. For carotenoid estimation, a band on the edge of carotenoid absorption (511 nm) combined with a red band performed best, while a normalized index of two water absorption bands (945, 971 nm) proved to be an effective water index. Finally, the attempt to investigate stress conditions through pigment ratios resulted in the use of the band centred at 701 nm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) is the most destructive insect infesting mature pine forests in North America and has devastated millions of hectares of forest in western Canada. Past studies have demonstrated the use of multispectral imagery for remote identification and mapping of visible or red attack damage in forests. This study aims to detect pre-visual or green attack damage in lodgepole pine needles by means of hyperspectral measurements, particularly via continuous wavelet analysis. Field measurements of lodgepole pine stands were conducted at two sites located northwest of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In June and August of 2007, reflectance spectra (350-2500 nm) were collected for 16 pairs of trees. Each of the 16 tree pairs included one control tree (healthy), and one stressed tree (girdled to simulate the effects of beetle infestation). In addition, during the period of June through October 2008, spectra were collected from 15 pairs of control- and beetle-infested trees. Spectra derived from these 31 tree pairs were subjected to a continuous wavelet transform, generating a scalogram that compiles the wavelet power as a function of wavelength location and scale of decomposition. Linear relationships were then explored between the wavelet scalograms and chemical properties or class labels (control and non-control) of the sample populations in order to isolate the most useful distinguishing spectral features that related to infested or girdled trees vs. control trees.
   A deficit in water content is observed in infested trees while an additional deficit in chlorophyll content is seen for girdled trees. The measurable water deficit of infested and girdled tree samples was detectable from the wavelet analysis of the reflectance spectra providing a novel method for the detection of green attack. The spectral features distinguishing control and infested trees are predominantly located between 950 and 1390 nm from scales 1 to 8. Of those, five features between 1318 to 1322 nm at scale 7 are consistently found in the July and August 2008 datasets. These features are located at longer wavelengths than those investigated in previous studies (below 1100 nm) and provide new insights into the potential remote detection of green attack. Spectral features that distinguish control and girdled trees were mostly observed between 1550 and 2370 nm from scales 1 to 5. The differing response of girdled and infested trees appears to indicate that the girdling process does not provide a perfect simulation of the effects caused by beetle infestation.
   It remains to be determined if the location of the 1318-1322 nm features, near the edge of a strong atmospheric water absorption band, will be sufficiently separable for use in airborne detection of green attack. A plot comparing needle water content and wavelet power at 1320 nm reveals considerable overlap between data derived from both infested and control samples, though the groups are statistically separable. This obstacle may preclude a high accuracy separation of healthy and infected single individuals, but establishing threshold identification levels may provide an economical, efficient and expeditious method for discriminating between healthy and infested tree populations.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of ground-based canopy reflectance measurements to detect changes in physiology and structure of vegetation in response to experimental warming and drought treatment at six European shrublands located along a North-South climatic gradient. We measured canopy reflectance, effective green leaf area index (green LAIe) and chlorophyll fluorescence of dominant species. The treatment effects on green LAIe varied among sites. We calculated three reflectance indices: photochemical reflectance index PRI [531 nm: 570 nm], normalized difference vegetation index NDVI(680) [780 nm; 680 nm] using red spectral region, and NDVI(570) [780 nm: 570 nm] using the same green spectral region as PRI. All three reflectance indices were significantly related to green LAIe and were able to detect changes in shrubland vegetation among treatments. In general warming treatment increased PRI and drought treatment reduced NDVI values. The significant treatment effect on photochemical efficiency of plants detected with PRI could not be detected by fluorescence measurements. However, we found canopy level measured PRI to be very sensitive to soil reflectance properties especially in vegetation areas with low green LAIe. As both soil reflectance and LAI varied between northern and southern sites it is problematic to draw universal conclusions of climate-derived changes in all vegetation types based merely on PRI measurements. We propose that canopy level PRI measurements can be more useful in areas of dense vegetation and dark soils. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The commonly applied surface temperature-vegetation index (T-s-VI) triangle method is used to estimate regional evapotranspiration (ET) in and and semi-arid regions. A practical algorithm based on the T-s-VI triangle method is developed to determine quantitatively the dry and wet edges of this triangle space. First, the T-s-VI triangle method is reviewed. Assumptions involved in this method are highlighted, and advantages, disadvantages and applicability are discussed. Then, an experimental use of the T-s-VI triangle method is developed and applied to several MODIS/TERRA datasets acquired during the Heihe Field Experiment from May 20th to August 21st, 2008. The sensible heat fluxes retrieved using MODIS data from a grassland located in the middle reach of Heihe river basin, Northwest China, are in good agreement with those measured from a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS). The Root Mean Square Error of this comparison is 25.07 W/m(2). It is shown that determination of dry and wet edges using the proposed algorithm is accurate enough at least in most cases of our study for the estimates of regional surface ET.

AB High-spectral resolution infrared spectra of the earth's atmosphere and surface are routinely available from satellite sensors, such as the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). We exploit the spectral content of AIRS data to demonstrate that airborne volcanic ash has a unique signature in the infrared (8-12 mu m) that can be used to infer particle size, infrared opacity and composition. The spectral signature is interpreted with the aid of a radiative transfer model utilizing the optical properties of andesite, rhyolite and quartz. Based on the infrared spectral signature, a new volcanic ash detection algorithm is proposed that can discriminate volcanic ash from other airborne substances and we show that the algorithm depends on particle size, optical depth and composition. The new algorithm has an improved sensitivity to optically thin ash clouds, and hence can detect them for longer (similar to 4 days) and at greater distances from the source(similar to 5000 km).

AB The characterization of field properties related to water in heterogeneous open canopies is limited by the lack of spatial resolution of satellite-based imagery and by the physical constraints of point observations on the ground. We apply here models based on canopy temperature estimated from high resolution airborne imagery to calculate tree canopy conductance (G(c)) and the crop water stress index (CWSI) of heterogeneous olive orchards. The Gc model requires the simulation of net radiation (R-n) and the aerodynamic resistance (r(a)) as a function of windspeed and canopy structure. In both cases, the R-n and r(a) models were tested against measurements and published data for olive orchards. Modeled values of G(c) of trees varying in water status correlated well with G(c) estimates obtained from stomatal conductance measurements in the same trees. The model used to calculate the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) took into account, not only the vapor pressure deficit but the R-n and the windspeed as well, parameters known to affect the temperature differences between the air and the tree canopy. The calculated CWSI for water deficit and well irrigated olive trees correlated with the water potential measured on the same trees. The methodology applied in this manuscript was used to validate the estimation of theoretical baselines needed for the CWSI calculations, comparing against traditional empirical baseline determination. High resolution thermal imagery obtained with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS), and from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) for two years was used to map G(c) and CWSI of an olive orchard where different irrigation treatments were applied. The methodology developed here enables the spatial analysis of water use within heterogeneous orchards, and the field characterization of water stress, leading to potential applications in the improvement of orchard irrigation management using high resolution thermal remote sensing imagery.

AB In this study we demonstrate how airborne laser scanning (ALS) can be applied to map effective leaf area index (LAI(e)) in a spruce forest, after being calibrated with ground based measurements. In 2003 and 2005, ALS data and field estimates of LAI(e) were acquired in a Norway spruce forest in SE Norway. We used LI-COR's LAI-2000 (R) Plant canopy analyzer ("LAI-2000") and hemispherical images ("HI") for field based estimates of LAI(e). ALS penetration rate calculated from first echoes and from first and last echoes was strongly related to field estimates of LAI(e). We fitted regression models of LAI(e) against the log-transformed inverse of the ALS penetration rate, and in accordance with the Beer-Lambert law this produced a linear, no-intercept relationship. This was particularly the case for the LAI-2000, having R(2) values > 0.9. The strongest relationship was obtained by selecting ALS data from within a circle around each plot with a radius of 0.75 times the tree height. We found a slight difference in the relationship for the two years, which can be attributed to the differences in the ALS acquisition settings. The relationship was valid across four age classes of trees representing different stages of stand development, except in one case with newly regenerated stands which most likely was an artifact. Using LAI(e) based on HI data produced weaker relationships with the ALS data. This was the case even when we simulated LAI-2000 measurements based on the HI data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Defoliation caused by repeated outbreaks of cyclic geometrid moths is the most prominent natural disturbance factor in the northern-boreal birch forest. Evidence suggests that recent changes in outbreak distribution and duration can be attributed to climate warming. There is hence an immediate need for methods that can be applied to characterize the geographical distribution of outbreaks. Here we assess the reliability of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) 16-day NDVI data for generating time series of the distribution of defoliation caused by moths attacking birch forest in Fennoscandia. We do so by first establishing the relationship between ground measures of moth larval density and a defoliation score based on MODIS-NDVI. We then calibrate and validate a model with the MODIS-NDVI defoliation score as a classifier to discriminate between areas with and without visible defoliation as identified from orthophotos and provide two examples of application of the model. We found the MODIS defoliation score to be a valid proxy for larval density (R(2)=0.88-0.93) above a certain, low threshold (a defoliation score of -5%). Areas with and without visible defoliation could be discriminated based on defoliation score with a substantial strength of agreement (max kappa = 0.736), and the resulting model was able to predict the proportion of area with visible defoliation in independent test areas with good reliability across the range of proportions. We conclude that satellite-derived defoliation patterns can be an invaluable tool for generating indirect population dynamical data that permits the development of targeted monitoring on relevant regional scales.

AB Mt Ruapehu is New Zealand's most active onshore volcano. In 2007, the volcano produced a large lahar following a break-out from the summit Crater Lake. Here, satellite and airborne remote sensing and image processing is used to extract the path of the lahar using ASTER and SPOTS visible and near infra-red imagery, ALOS-PALSAR L-band synthetic aperture RADAR data, and airborne LiDAR. The results obtained from each of these datasets were compared to the lahar deposit manually digitized from aerial photography. SPOT5 imagery produced the most accurate map of the lahar deposit (77% correct), even though these data were acquired a year after the event. This is attributed to the spatial resolution of the data. The ALOS-PALSAR coherence mapping calculated from images acquired 2 months before and nine months after the lahar was not as accurate as that obtained using the optical imagery (43% correct), but this was still considered an important tool for acquiring data during cloudy periods. LiDAR topographic data, collected to constrain geomorphic changes caused by the lahar, was the least accurate in terms of mapping the lahar path (28% correct). No single technique was deemed to be the most accurate under all circumstances, and a combination of data types would produce the best results. By combining the satellite and LiDAR data, it was possible to accurately classify 92% of the lahar path. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Landsat time series data sets were acquired for the Santa Fe National Forest in New Mexico. This area includes the San Pedro Parks Wilderness area, which was designated as an official wilderness in 1964. Eight autumnal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TMI) scenes acquired from 1988 to 2006 were analyzed to determine whether significant changes have occurred throughout the region during the past 18 years and, if so, to assess whether the changes are long-term and gradual or short-term and abrupt. It was found that, starting in about 1995, many of the conifer stands within the Wilderness area showed consistently gradual and marked increases in the Shortwave Infrared/Near Infrared Index. These trends generally imply decreases in canopy greenness or increases in mortality. Other high-elevation conifer forests located outside of the Wilderness area showed similar spectral trends, indicating that changes are potentially widespread. The spatial patterns of forest damage as inferred from the image analyses were very similar to the general patterns of insect defoliation damage mapped via aerial sketch mapping by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Health Monitoring Program. A field visit indicated that zones of spectral change are associated with high levels of forest damage and mortality, likely caused by a combination of insects and drought. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using historical Landsat data for providing objective and consistent long-term assessments of the gradual ecosystem changes that are occurring within the western United States.

AB We present and describe a modeling and analysis framework for monitoring protected area (PA) ecosystems with net primary productivity (NPP) as an indicator of health. It brings together satellite data, an ecosystem simulation model (NASA-CASA), spatial linear models with autoregression, and a GIS to provide practitioners a low-cost, accessible ecosystem monitoring and analysis system (EMAS) at landscape resolutions. The EMAS is evaluated and assessed with an application example in Yellowstone National Park aimed at identifying the causes and consequences of drought. Utilizing five predictor covariates (solar radiation, burn severity, soil temperature, and precipitation), spatio-temporal analysis revealed how landscape controls and productivity, climate (summer vegetation moisture stress) affected patterns of NPP according to vegetation functional type, species cover type, and successional stage. These results supported regional and national trends of NPP in relation to carbon fluxes and lag effects of climate. Overall, the EMAS provides valuable decision support for PAS regarding informed land use planning, conservation programs, vital sign monitoring, control programs (fire fuels, invasives, etc.), and restoration efforts (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Sarfartoq carbonatite complex occurs in the southern West Greenland in a transition zone between Archaean gneiss complex to the south and a Proterozoic mobile belt to the north. The Sarfartoq carbonatite complex consists of a core zone composed of dolomite carbonatite and minor sovite (calcite carbonatite) surrounded by a fenite zone and a marginal zone of gneisses frequently altered due to hydrothermal activity. High spatial and spectral resolution imaging spectrometer data recorded by the HyMap imaging system were used to map lithology of the Sarfartoq carbonatite complex. A careful analysis of the spectral reflectance properties of the carbonatite lithology preceded the HyMap data analysis stage. The spectral reflectance measurements showed that the various lithologic units including dolomite carbonatite, sovite, fenite and the marginal alteration zone have distinct spectral reflectance characteristics. The analysis of the HyMap data was based on an unsupervised clustering algorithm, the Self Organizing Maps (SOM), for the mapping of the main lithology and a hierarchical tree for the mapping of sparsely occurring sovite rocks. Spectral mixture analysis was applied to map fractional abundances and compare with the SOM results. The resulting lithological map shows the spatial distribution of dolomite carbonatite, sovite, fenite with abundant carbonatite dykes (representing the outer core of the carbonatite complex), fenite and hematized gneiss (marginal alteration zone). The results compare well with the field data collected for the assessment of the mapping accuracy and due to the spatially contiguous nature of the hyperspectral data could be used to better map the outcropping carbonatite lithology. The spectral reflectance measurements and the mapping results provide information of petrological importance for the carbonatite core zone. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate estimation of phytoplankton chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration from remotely sensed data is particularly challenging in turbid. productive waters. The objectives of this study are to validate the applicability of a semi-analytical three-band algorithm in estimating Chla concentration in the highly turbid, widely variable waters of Taihu Lake, China, and to improve the algorithm using a proposed four-band algorithm. The improved algorithm is expressed as [Rrs(lambda(1))(-1)-Rrs(lambda(2))(-1)][Rrs(lambda(4))(-1)-Rrs(lambda(3))(-1)](-1). The two semi- analytical algorithms are calibrated and evaluated against two independent datasets collected from 2007 and 2005 in Taihu Lake. Strong linear relationships were established between measured Chla concentration and that derived from the three-band algorithm of [Rrs(-1)(660)-Rrs(-1)(692)]Rrs(740) and the four-band algorithm of [Rrs(-1)(662)-Rrs(-1)(693)][Rrs(-1)(740)-Rrs(-1)(705)](-1). The first algorithm accounts for 87% and 80% variation in Chla concentration in the 2007 and 2005 datasets, respectively. The second algorithm accounts for 97% of variability in Chla concentration for the 2007 dataset and 87% of variation in the 2005 dataset. The three-band algorithm has a mean relative error (MRE) of 43.9% and 34.7% for the 2007 and 2005 datasets. The corresponding figures for the four-band algorithm are 26.7% and 28.4%. This study demonstrates the potential of the four-band model in estimating Chla even in highly turbid case 2 waters. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Nearest neighbors techniques have been shown to be useful for predicting multiple forest attributes from forest inventory and Landsat satellite image data. However, in regions lacking good digital land cover information. nearest neighbors selected to predict continuous variables such as tree volume must be selected without regard to relevant categorical variables such as forest/non-forest. The result is that non-zero volume predictions may be obtained for pixels predicted to be non-forest, and volume predictions for pixels predicted to be forest may be erroneously small due to non-forest nearest neighbors. For users who wish to circumvent this discrepancy, a two-step algorithm is proposed in which the class of a relevant categorical variable such as land cover is predicted in the first step. and continuous variables such as volume are predicted in the second step subject to the constraint that all nearest neighbors must come from the predicted class of the categorical variable. Nearest neighbors, multinomial logistic regression, and discriminant analysis techniques were investigated for use in the first step. The results were generally similar for the three techniques, although the multinomial logistic regression technique was slightly superior. The k-Nearest Neighbors technique was used in the second step because many continuous forest inventory variables do not satisfy the distributional assumptions necessary for parametric multivariate techniques. The results for six 15-km x 15-km areas of interest in northern Minnesota, USA, indicate that areal estimates of tree volume, basal area, and density obtained from pixel predictions are comparable to plot-based estimates and estimates by conifer and deciduous classes are also comparable to plot-based estimates. When a mixed conifer/deciduous class was included, predictions for the mixed and deciduous class were confused. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Accurate assessment of phytoplankton chlorophyll-a (chla) concentrations in turbid waters by means of remote sensing is challenging due to the optical complexity of case 2 waters. We have applied a recently developed model of the form [R-rs(-1)(lambda(1))-R-rs(-1)(lambda(2))] x R-rs(lambda(3)) where R-rs(lambda(i)) is the remote-sensing reflectance at the wavelength lambda(i), for the estimation of chla concentrations in turbid waters. The objectives of this paper are (a) to validate the three-band model as well as its special case, the two-band model R-rs(-1)(lambda(1)) x R-rs(lambda(3)), using datasets collected over a considerable range of optical properties, trophic status, and geographical locations in turbid lakes, reservoirs, estuaries, and coastal waters, and (b) to evaluate the extent to which the three-band Model Could be applied to the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and two-band model Could be applied to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate chla in turbid waters.
   The three-band model was calibrated and validated using three MERIS spectral bands (660-670 nm, 703.75-713.75 nm, and 750-757.5 nm), and the 2-band model was tested using two MODIS spectral hands (lambda(1) = 662-672, lambda(3) = 743-753 nm). We assessed the accuracy of chla prediction in four independent datasets without reparameterization (adjustment of the coefficients) after initial calibration elsewhere. Although the validation data set contained widely variable chla (1.2 to 236 mg m(-3)), Secchi disk depth (0.18 to 4.1 m), and turbidity (1.3 to 78 NTU), chla predicted by the three-band algorithm was strongly correlated with observed chla (r(2) > 0.96), with a precision of 32% and average bias across data sets of -4.9% to 11%. Chla predicted by the two-band algorithm was also closely correlated with observed chin (r(2) > 0.92); however, the precision declined to 57%, and average bias across the data sets was 19% to 50.3%. These findings imply that, provided that an atmospheric correction scheme for the red and NIR bands is available, the extensive database of MERIS and MODIS imagery could be used for quantitative monitoring of chla turbid waters.

AB The current outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) in western Canada has been increasing over the past decade and is currently estimated to be impacting 9.2 million hectares, with varying levels of severity. Large area insect monitoring is typically undertaken using manual aerial overview sketch mapping, whereby an interpreter depicts areas of homogenous insect attack conditions onto 1:250,000 OF 1: 100,000 scale maps. These Surveys provide valuable strategic data for management at the provincial scale. The coarse spatial and attribute resolution of these data however, make them inappropriate for fine-scale monitoring and operational planning. For instance, it is not possible to estimate the initial timing of attack and year of stand death. In this study, we utilise eight Landsat scenes collected over a 14 year period in north-central British Columbia, Canada, where the infestation has gradually developed both spatially and temporally. After pre-processing and normalising the eight scenes using a relative normalisation procedure, decision free analysis was applied to classify spectral trajectories of the Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). From the classified temporal sequence of images, key parameters were extracted including the presence of beetle disturbance and timing of stand decline. The accuracy of discriminating beetle attack from healthy forest stands was assessed both spatially and temporally using three years of aerial survey data (1996, 2003, and 2004) with results indicating overall classification accuracies Varying between 71 and 86%. As expected, the earliest and least severe attack year (1996), recorded the lowest overall accuracy. The relationship between the timing of stand attack (i.e. moderate to severe beetle infestation) and NDMI (initial year of detected disturbance) was also explored. The results Suggest that there is potential for deriving regional estimates of the year of stand death using Landsat data and decision tree analysis however, a higher temporal frequency of images is required to quantify the timing of mountain pine beetle attack.

AB The application of the new Water Framework Directive (WFD) of the European Union will require a dense and frequent monitoring of chlorophyll-a near the coast. Not counting the transitional water bodies located in the vicinity of estuaries, not less than seventy four coastal water bodies have to be monitored along the coast of the French Atlantic continental shelf and the English Channel. All the available data have to be gathered to implement a comprehensive monitoring scheme. To this purpose, we evaluate the capacity of ocean colour imagery to complete the conventional in situ data set collected in coastal networks. Satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentration is obtained by the application of a coastal Look-Up-Table to water-leaving radiance of the Sea-viewing Wide Field Instrument Sensor (SeaWiFS) for the 1998-2004 period. Seven years of satellite-derived and in situ chlorophyll-a concentrations are compared at seven representative stations of different water bodies. These comparisons show that the satellite products are reliable in most of the situations studied and throughout the seasons. Then the satellite imagery is used to classify the coastal waters following the eutrophication risk criterion of the WFD. This classification is made according to the percentile-90 of chlorophyll-a calculated during the productive season, from March to October. Despite a lack of sensor coverage over a small fraction of the near shore waters, this work shows that the satellite monitoring can considerably ease the application of the WFD.

AB The principal goal in early missions of satellite-borne visible spectral radiometry (ocean colour) was to create synoptic fields of phytoplankton biomass indexed as concentration of chlorophyll-a. In the context of climate change, a major application of the results has been in the modelling of primary production and the ocean carbon cycle. It is now recognised that a partition of the marine autotrophic pool into a suite of phytoplankton functional types, each type having a characteristic role in the biogeochemical cycle of the ocean, would increase our understanding of the role of phytoplankton in the global carbon cycle. At the same time, new methods have been emerging that use visible spectral radiometry to map some of the phytoplankton functional types. Here, we assess the state of the art, and suggest paths for future work. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Direct estimation of photosynthetic light-use efficiency (WE) from space would be of significant benefit to LUE-based models which use inputs from remote sensing to estimate terrestrial productivity. The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) has shown promise in tracking LUE at the leaf- to small canopy levels, but its use at regional to global scales still remains a challenge. In this study, we used different formulations of PRI calculated from the MODIS ocean band centered at 531 nm and a set of alternative reference bands at 488, 551, and 678 nm to explore the relationship between PRI and LUE where WE was measured at eight eddy covariance flux towers located in the boreal forest of Saskatchewan, Canada. The magnitude and variability of WE was significantly lower at the times when useful MODIS ocean band images were available (i.e. around midday under clear-sky conditions) relative to the rest of the growing season. PR1678 (reference band at 678 nm) showed the strongest relationship (r(2)=0.70) with LUE90a (i.e. 90-minute mean WE calculated using Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, APAR), but only when all sites were combined. Overall, the relationships between the MODIS PRIs and LUE90a were always stronger for observations closer to the backscatter direction and there were no significant differences in the strength of the correlations whether LUE was calculated based on incident PAR or on APAR. Predictions of ecosystem photosynthesis at the time of the MODIS overpasses were significantly improved by multiplying either PAR or APAR by MODIS PRI (r(2) improved from 0.09 to 0.44 and 0.54 depending on the PRI formulation). We used our PRI-LUE model to create a regional LUE90a map for the three cover types covering 47,500 km(2) around the flux sites. The MODIS PRI-derived LUE90a map appeared to capture more realistic spatial heterogeneity of LUE across the landscape compared to a daily WE map derived using the look-up table in the MODIS GPP (MOD17) algorithm. While our LUE map is only a snapshot of minimum regional LUE90a values, with appropriate gap-filling methods it could be used to improve regional-scale monitoring of GPR Moreover, the strong relationship between midday and daily WE on clear days (r(2)=0.93) indicates that instantaneous MODIS observations of LUE90a could be used to estimate daily WE. Finally, pixel shadow fraction from the 5-Scale geometric-optical model was closely related to both MODIS PRI and tower-derived LUE suggesting that differences in stand leaf area and in diffuse illumination among flux sites play a role in the relationship we observed between LUE and MODIS PRI.

AB Two algorithms designed to detect deepwater oceanic features and arbitrary edge profiles were tuned to automatically delineate fronts in coastal waters off west-central Florida using satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl), normalized water-leaving radiance (nL(W)), and fluorescence line height (FLH) images during select periods in the spring and fall of 2004 and 2005. The dates correspond to recreational king mackerel, Scomberomorus cavalla, tournaments. A histogram-based algorithm was useful to detect coastal surface SST nL(W), and FLH fronts, specifically. A gradient-based algorithm, with a smaller kernel box of 3x3 pixels, best identified nearshore (< 10 m depth) features in Chi images at the mouth of Tampa Bay, but was less effective for fronts farther offshore where gradients were weaker. Local winds and tide levels estimated from a coastal observing buoy, and bathymetric gradients were examined to help understand the factors that influenced front formation and stability. Periods of strong and variable winds led to front movement of up to 10 km per day or dissipation within 2-3 days in over 80% of the fronts detected in SST, Chi, nL(W) and FLH imagery. Short episodes of less variable wind velocities typically led to more stable and stationary fronts, within 3-5 km, for up to four days. The occurrence of fronts closely associated with the coastal bathymetry, namely at the 20 m and 30 m isobaths, was significantly higher in the fall SST imagery and in the spring Chi imagery. Fall SST fronts related to bathymetric gradients likely resulted from progressive cooling of the water with depth. Stronger Chi and nL(W)443 gradients at the mouths of estuaries in the fall compared to the spring were attributed to increased precipitation and periods of stronger winds or tides. The FLH imagery was most useful in delineating coastal algal blooms. The automatic front detection techniques applied here can be an important tool for resource managers to track coastal oceanographic features daily, over synoptic spatial scales.

AB Metrics that estimate the beginning of the growing season in semi-arid monsoonal ecosystems have become a central part of both crop models that are used to monitor crop production using satellite remote sensing and early warning indicators of possible future reductions in yield due to growing season length. This paper presents a new phenological model which is tuned to the semi-arid, monsoonal ecosystem of the West African Sahel and that uses humidity instead of calendar dates to identify the beginning of the season. We implement this model on vegetation index data from AVHRR, SPOT-Vegetation and MODIS data, and evaluate the results along with a rainfall-based start of season estimate for the region. Contributions of the paper include evaluating existing methods using ground observations of sowing date, comparing the same metric across multiple sensors and to rainfall-based SOS, and the development of a metric based on NDVI and relative humidity.

AB It can be difficult to further scientific understanding of rare or endangered species that live in inaccessible habitat using traditional methods, such as probabilistic modeling based on field data collection. Remote sensing (RS) can be an important source of information for the study of these animals. A key advantage of RS is its ability to provide information over an animal's complete range, but models incorporating RS data are limited by RS's ability to detect important habitat features. In this study, we focus on the rare, poorly-understood mountain bongo antelope (Tragelaphus euryceros isaaci) which survives in the wild in isolated pockets of montane forest in Kenya. We hypothesize that mountain bongo habitat is multi-scaled. We analyzed field and RS data (derived from SPOT, ASTER, and MODIS) ranging in scale from 0.02-85.93 ha to test our hypothesis. Important microhabitat features were identified through logistic regression models of vegetation structure data collected in plots (0.04 ha) of bongo presence (n=36) and absence (n=90). Models were selected using an information theoretic approach. We analyzed the correlations between microhabitat (four canopy and four understorey structure measures) and RS variables derived using spectral mixture (SMA) and texture analysis; most ASTER and SPOT variables were significantly related with canopy structure variables (max vertical bar r vertical bar=0.56), but correlations between understorey structure and all but two RS variables were insignificant. Further logistic regression modeling showed that combining field microhabitat (primarily understorey structure variables) and larger-scaled RS measures (ASTER spectral mixture analysis variables aggregated to 450 m (20.25 ha)) provided superior models of bongo habitat selection than those based on field or RS data only. The results demonstrate that: 1) forest canopy characteristics at scales of similar to 20 ha and understorey structural conditions at the micro-scale of 0.04 ha were the most important features influencing bongo habitat selection; 2) models for predicting bongo habitat distribution must incorporate both micro- and macro-habitat variables; 3) optical RS data may characterize important micro-scale canopy variables with reasonable accuracy, but are ineffective for detecting understorey features (unless alternative techniques such as forest structural indices can be successfully applied); 4) RS and field data are both essential for understanding bongo habitat selection. The technique employed here for understanding this rare antelope's habitat selection may also be applied in studies of other large herbivores. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we investigate if MERIS full resolution (FR) data (300 m) is sufficient to monitor changes in optical constituents in Himmerfjarden, a fjord-like, north-south facing bay of about 30 km length and 4 km width. The MERIS FR products were derived using a coastal processor (FUB Case-2 Plug-In). We also compared the performance between FUB and standard processor (MEGS 7.4), using reduced resolution (RR) data (1 km resolution) from the open Baltic Sea, and compared the products to sea-truthing data. The optical variables measured for sea-truthing were chlorophyll, suspended particulate matter (SPM), as well as coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM, also termed yellow substances), and the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient, K-d(490). The comparison of the RR data to the sea-truthing data showed that, in the open Baltic Sea, the MERIS standard processor overestimated chlorophyll by about 59%, and SPM by about 28%, and underestimated yellow substance by about 81%, whereas the FUB processor underestimated SPNI by about 60%, CDOM by about 78%, and chlorophyll a by about 56%. The FUB processor showed a relatively high precision for all optical components (standard deviation: 6-18%), whereas the precision for the MEGS 7.4 was rather low (standard deviation: 43-73%), except for CDOM (standard deviation: 13%). The analysis of the FR data showed that all FR level 2 water products derived from MERIS followed a polynomial decline in concentration when moving off-shore. The distribution of chlorophyll and SPM was best described by a 2nd order polynomial, and the distribution of CDOM by a 3rd order polynomial, verifying the diffusional model described in Kratzer and Tell [Kratzer, S. and Tett, P. (in press). Using bio-optics to investigate the extent of coastal waters - a Swedish case study. Hydrobiologia.]. A new Kd(490) and Secchi depth algorithm based on MERIS channel 3 (490 nm) and channel 6 (620 nm) each was derived from radiometric sea-truthing data (TACCS, Satlantic). Applying the Kd(490) algorithm to the MERIS FR data over Himmerfjarden, and comparing to sea-truthing data the results showed a strong correlation (r=0.94). When comparing the FR data to the sea-truthing data CDOM and Kd(490) showed a low accuracy, but a high precision with a rather constant off-set. In summary, one may state that the precision of MERIS data improves by applying the FUB Case-2 processor and the accuracy improves with improved spatial resolution for chlorophyll and SPNI. Furthermore, the FUB processor can be used off-the-shelf for open Baltic Sea monitoring, provided one corrects for the respective off-set from sea-truthing data which is most likely caused by an inaccuracy in the atmospheric correction. Additionally, the FR data can be used to derive CDOM, Kd(490) and Secchi depth in Himmmerfjarden if one corrects for the respective off-set. We will need to perform more comparisons between sea-truthing and MERIS FR data before the new K-d(490) algorithm can be made operational, including also scenes from other times of year. In order to provide a level 2 product that can be used reliably by the Baltic Sea user community, our recommendation to ESA is to include the spectral attenuation coefficient as a MERIS standard product.

AB Mangrove forests change frequently due to disturbances from tropical storms, frost, lightning, and insects. It has been suggested that the death and regeneration of trees in small gaps due to lightning may play a critical role in mangrove forest turnover; however, the large-scale quantification of spatial pattern and areas of gaps is lacking for investigating this issue. Airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology provides an effective way for identifying gaps by remotely obtaining direct measurements of ground and canopy elevations. A method based on an alternative sequential filter and black top-hat mathematical morphological transformation was developed to extract gap features. Comparison of identified gap polygons with raw LIDAR measurements and field surveys shows that the proposed method successfully extracted gap features in mangrove forests in Everglades National Park. There are 400-500 lightning gaps per square kilometer in mangrove forests at the study sites. The distribution of gap sizes follows an exponential form and the area of gaps with sizes larger than 100 m(2) account for 55-61% of the total area of gaps. The area of gaps in the mangrove forest in Everglades National Park is about 4-5% of the total forest area and the average gap formation rate is about 0.3% of the total forest area per year, indicating that lightning gaps play an important role in mangrove forest dynamics.

AB This study presents a method to assimilate leaf area index retrieved from ENVISAT ASAR and MERIS data into CERES-Wheat crop growth model with the objective to improve the accuracy of the wheat yield predictions at catchment scale. The assimilation method consists in re-initialising the model with optimal input parameters allowing a better temporal agreement between the LAI simulated by the model and the LAI estimated by remote sensing data. A variational assimilation algorithm has been applied to minimise the difference between simulated and remotely-sensed LAI and to determine the optimal set of input parameters. After the re-initialisation, the wheat yield maps have been obtained and their accuracy evaluated.
   The method has been applied over Matera site located in Southern Italy and validated by using the dataset of an experimental campaign carried out during the 2004 wheat growing season.
   Results indicate that, LAI maps retrieved from MERIS and ASAR data can be effectively assimilated into CERES-Wheat model thus leading to accuracies of the yield maps ranging from 360 kg/ha to 420 kg/ha. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wild-land fires have become intense and more frequent all over the world. Improving the accuracy of mapping fuel models is essential for fuel management decisions and explicit fire behavior prediction for real-time support of suppression tactics and logistics decisions. The overall aim of this paper is to develop the use of lidar (LIght Detection and Ranging) remote sensing to accurately and effectively assess fuel models in East Texas. More specific goals include: (1) developing lidar derived products and the methodology to use them for assessing fuel models; (2) investigating the use of several techniques for data fusion of lidar and multispectral imagery for assessing fuel models; (3) investigating the gain in fuels mapping accuracy when using lidar as opposed to QuickBird imagery alone; and (4) producing spatially explicit digital fuel maps. Estimates of fuel models were compared with in-situ data collected over 62 plots. We employ a unique approach to classify fuel models using a combination of lidar height bins and multispectral image data. Different image processing approaches for fusing lidar and multispectral data, such as the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) and Principle Component Analysis (PCA), were used to improve the overall accuracy of image classification. Supervised image classification methods provided better accuracy (90.10%) with the fusion of airborne lidar data with QuickBird data than with QuickBird imagery alone (76.52%).
   According to our results, lidar derived data provide accurate estimates of surface fuel parameters efficiently and accurately over extensive areas of forests. This study demonstrates the importance of using accurate maps of fuel models derived using new lidar remote sensing techniques. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper discusses the development of simple multiple linear regression (MLR) models for developing seasonal forecasts of the annual minimum sea-ice extent in the Beaufort/Chukchi Seas, the Laptev/East Siberian Seas, the Kara/Barents Seas, and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago regions. The potential predictor data are based on mean monthly weighted indices of sea-ice concentration, multiyear sea-ice concentration, surface skin temperature, surface albedo, and downwelling longwave radiation flux at the surface. Predictions are developed based on data available in March (spring forecast), to coincide with the National American Ice Service's annual outlooks, and based on data available in June (summer forecast), which would provide a seasonal revision. The final regression equations retain one to three predictors, and each of the MLR models is superior to climatology. The r(2) for the MLR models range from a low of 0.44 (for the spring forecast in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago) to a high of 0.80 (for the summer forecast in the BeauforL/Chukchi Seas).

AB The stagnation of Himalayan glaciers will only be exacerbated by a warming climate, increasing hazards associated with glacier lake development. Frontal recession is a poor indicator of negative balance in this region where most glaciers are debris covered, but reduced glacier flow rates provide a valuable warning of stagnation. In-situ measurements of velocity are understandably rare and remote sensing measurements have hitherto been limited by severe topography and lack of suitable data.
   In this paper, we compare two techniques to measure flow rates in Everest region glaciers. Firstly, satellite radar interferometry (SRI) has recently become more viable because of improved digital elevation data and precision orbit models, which now allow snapshots of velocities to be retrieved from ERS imagery in the mid 1990s without ground control information. Secondly, feature tracking between Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is found to be successful, even on the small glaciers of this region, because of the patterning associated with debris cover. This technique extends through the 1990s and beyond, the time frame over which velocities can be measured. Using the examples of the Khumbu glacier flowing south into Nepal and the Kangshung glacier flowing East into China from the Everest massif, we compare SRI and SAR feature tracking in ERS images, consider the errors in these techniques, and examine the potential to monitor flow rates across the region.
   The techniques are found to be highly complementary and appropriate for monitoring flow rates in this region, suggesting that routine monitoring of Himalayan glaciers is possible. The Kangshung glacier appears to sustain relatively high flow rates of up to 10 cm/day which, along with a convex topographic profile, indicates a healthy glacier not exhibiting significant negative mass balance. In comparison, much of the Khumbu glacier appears to have stagnated, the surface velocity at Gorak Shep is only 20% of a field-based measurement in the 1970's, and the concave surface profile confirms the downwasting associated with a debris-covered glacier in recession.

AB This study compared the suitability of LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) data, three-band multispectral data, and LIDAR data integrated with multispectral information, for classifying spatially complex vegetation in the Aspen Parkland of western Canada. Classifications were performed for both a) general vegetation classes limited to three major formations of deciduous forest, shrubland and grassland, and b) eight detailed vegetation classes including upland mixed prairie and fescue grasslands, closed and semi-open aspen forests, western snowberry and silverberry shrublands, and fresh and saline riparian (lowland) meadows. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Surface Elevation Model (SEM) developed from LIDAR data incorporated both topographic and biological biases in community positioning across the landscape. Using multispectral data, the original digital image mosaic, its hybrid color composite, and an intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) image were each tested. Final vegetation classification was done through integration of information from both digital images and LIDAR data to evaluate the improvement in classification accuracy. Among the land cover schedules with three and eight classes of vegetation, classification from the multispectral imagery, specifically the hybrid color composite image, had the highest accuracy, peaking at 74.6% and 59.4%, respectively. In contrast, the LIDAR classification schedules led to an average classification accuracy of 64.8% and 52.3%, respectively, for the general and detailed vegetation data. Subsequent integration of the LIDAR and digital image classification schedules resulted in accuracy improvements of 16 to 20%, resulting in a superior final accuracy of 91% and 80.3%, respectively, for the three and eight classes of vegetation. A final land cover map including 8 classes of vegetation, fresh and saline water, as well as bare ground, was created for the study area with an overall accuracy of 83.9%, highlighting the benefit of integrating LIDAR and multispectral imagery for enhanced vegetation classification in heterogenous rangeland environments.

AB Recent advances in instrument design have led to considerable improvements in wildfire mapping at regional and global scales. Global and regional active fire and burned area products are currently available from various satellite sensors. While only global products can provide consistent assessments of fire activity at the global, hemispherical or continental scales, the efficiency of their performance differs in various ecosystems. The available regional products are hard-coded to the specifics of a given ecosystem (e.g. boreal forest) and their mapping accuracy drops dramatically outside the intended area. We present a regionally adaptable semi-automated approach to mapping burned area using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. This is a flexible remote sensing/GIS-based algorithm which allows for easy modification of algorithm parameterization to adapt it to the regional specifics of fire occurrence in the biome or region of interest. The algorithm is based on Normalized Burned Ratio differencing (dNBR) and therefore retains the variability of spectral response of the area affected by fire and has the potential to be used beyond binary burned/unburned mapping for the first-order characterization of fire impacts from remotely sensed data. The algorithm inputs the MODIS Surface Reflectance 8-Day Composite product (MOD09A1) and the MODIS Active Fire product (MOD14) and outputs yearly maps of burned area with dNBR values and beginning and ending dates of mapping as the attributive information. Comparison of this product with high resolution burn scar information from Landsat ETM+ imagery and fire perimeter data shows high levels of accuracy in reporting burned area across different ecosystems. We evaluated algorithm performance in boreal forests of Central Siberia, Mediterranean-type ecosystems of California, and sagebrush steppe of the Great Basin region of the US. In each ecosystem the MODIS burned area estimates were within 15% of the estimates produced by the high resolution base with the R-2 between 0.87 and 0.99. In addition, the spatial accuracy of large burn scars in the boreal forests of Central Siberia was also high with Kappa values ranging between 0.76 and 0.79. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB The snow-melting zone forms a site of marked physical-hydrological processes. A basic requirement for monitoring such zones is the data on temperature distribution, for which the method of environmental lapse rate and remote sensing with thermal infrared scanners have been used earlier. In this study, repetitive multispectral image data sets acquired from IRS-LISS-III satellite sensor have been used for snow mapping in the Gangotri glacier, Himalayas, and topographically corrected reflectance values have been computed using a digital elevation model. Temperature measurements at a field station have been used for estimating temperature distribution in the snow-covered basin on the corresponding dates. It is shown here that in the melting seasonal snow zone, the topographically corrected mean near-IR reflectance systematically decreases from higher to lower elevation levels, and can be broadly related to the environmental temperature distribution in a restricted range of about 0-5 degrees C. As a large number of satellites routinely provide data in the reflected infrared range, this method appears to have a reasonable potential, at least to provide surrogate data for filling-in gaps in the database, with possible applications in environmental surveillance, runoff modeling, climatic modeling and numerous other snowfield studies.

AB Modelling and mapping of hooded warbler (Wilsonia citrina) nesting habitat in forests of southern Ontario were conducted using Ikonos and Landsat data. The study began with an analysis of skyward hemispherical photography to determine canopy characteristics associated with nest sites. It showed that nest sites had significantly less overhead canopy cover and larger maximum gap size than in non-nest areas. These findings led to the hypothesis that brightness variability in high to moderate resolution remotely sensed imagery may be greater at nest sites than in non-nest areas due to larger shadows and greater shadow variability related to these gap characteristics. This was confirmed when, in addition to some spectral band brightness variables, several image texture and spectrally unmixed fraction (shadow, bare soil) variables were found to be significantly different for nest and non-nest sites in Ikonos and Landsat imagery. These significantly different variables were used in maximum likelihood classification (MLC) and logistic regression (LR) to produce maps of potential nesting habitat. Mapping was conducted with Ikonos and Landsat in a local area where most known nest sites occur, and regionally using Landsat data for almost all of the hooded warbler range in southern Ontario. For the local area mapping using Ikonos data, a posteriori probabilities for both the MLC and LR methods showed that about 62% of the nest sites set aside for validation had been classified with high probability (p > 0.70) in the nest class. MLC mapping accuracy was 70% for the validation nest sites and 87% of validation nest sites were within 10 in of classified nesting habitat, a distance approximately equivalent to expected positional error in the data. LR accuracy was slightly lower. Nest site MLC mapping accuracy in the local area using Landsat data was 87% but the map was much coarser due to the larger pixel size. Regional mapping with Landsat imagery produced lower classification accuracy due to high errors of commission for the habitat class. This resulted from a poor spatial distribution and low number of observations of nest sites throughout the region compared to the local area, while the non-nest site data distribution was too narrow, having been defined and assessed (using standard accepted methods) as areas with no ground shrubs. If either of these problems can be ameliorated, regional mapping accuracy may improve. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Two models were evaluated for their ability to estimate land surface evaporation at 16-day intervals using MODIS remote sensing data and surface meteorology as inputs. The first was the aerodynamic resistance-surface energy balance model, and the second was the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, where the required surface conductance is estimated from remotely-sensed leaf area index. The models were tested using 3 years of evaporation and meteorological measurements from two contrasting Australian ecosystems, a cool temperate, evergreen Eucalyptus forest and a wet/dry, tropical savanna. The aerodynamic resistance-surface energy balance approach failed because small errors in the radiative surface temperature translate into large errors in sensible heat, and hence into estimates of evaporation. The P-M model adequately estimated the magnitude and seasonal variation in evaporation in both ecosystems (RMSE=27 W m(-2), R-2 = 0.74), demonstrating the validity of the proposed surface conductance algorithm. This, and the ability to constrain evaporation estimates via the energy balance, demonstrates the superiority of the P-M equation over the surface temperature-based model. There was no degradation in the performance of the P-M model when gridded meteorological data at coarser spatial (0.05 degrees) and temporal (daily) resolution were substituted for local ly-measured inputs.
   The P-M approach was used to generate a monthly evaporation climatology for Australia from 2001 to 2004 to demonstrate the potential of this approach for monitoring land surface evaporation and constructing monthly water budgets frorn 1-krn to continental spatial scales.

AB Forest succession is a fundamental ecological process which can impact the functioning of many terrestrial processes, such as water and nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration. Therefore, knowing the distribution of forest successional stages over a landscape facilitates a greater understanding of terrestrial ecosystems. One way of characterizing forest succession over the landscape is to use satellite imagery to map forest successional stages continuously over a region. In this study we use a forest succession model (ZELIG) and a canopy reflectance model (GORT) to produce spectral trajectories of forest succession from young to old-growth stages, and compared the simulated trajectories with those constructed from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery to understand the potential of mapping forest successional stages with remote sensing. The simulated successional trajectories captured the major characteristics of observed regional mean succession trajectory with Landsat TM imagery for Tasseled Cap indices based on age information from the Pacific Northwest Forest Inventory and Analysis Integrated Database produced by Pacific Northwest Research Station, USDA Forest Service. Though the successional trajectories are highly nonlinear in the early years of succession, a linear model fits well the regional mean successional trajectories for brightness and greenness due to significant cross-site variations that masked the nonlinearity over a regional scale (R-2=0.8951 for regional mean brightness with age; R-2=0.9348 for regional mean greenness with age). Regression analysis found that Tasseled Cap brightness and greenness are much better predictors of forest successional stages than wetness index based on the data analyzed in this study. The spectral history based on multitemporal Landsat imagery can be used to effectively identify mature and old-growth stands whose ages do not match with remote sensing signals due to change occurred during the time between ground data collection and image acquisition. Multitemporal Landsat imagery also improves prediction of forest successional stages. However, a linear model on a stand basis has a limited predictive power of forest stand successional stages (adjusted R-2=0.5435 using the Tasseled Cap indices from all four images used in this study) due to significant variations in remote sensing signals for stands at the same successional stage. Therefore, accurate prediction of forest successional stage using remote sensing imagery at stand scale requires accounting for site-specific factors influence remotely sensed signals in the future.

AB The monitoring of earth surface dynamic processes at a global scale requires high temporal frequency remote sensing observations which are provided up to now by moderate spatial resolution sensors. However, the spatial heterogeneity within the moderate spatial resolution pixel biases non-linear estimation processes of land surface variables from remote sensing data. To limit its influence on the description of land surface processes, corrections based on the quantification of the intra-pixel heterogeneity may be applied to non-linear estimation processes. A complementary strategy is to define the proper pixel size to capture the spatial variability of the data and minimize the intra-pixel variability.
   This work provides a methodology to characterize and quantify the spatial heterogeneity of landscape vegetation cover from the modeling of the variogram of high spatial resolution NDVI data. NDVI variograms for 18 landscapes extracted from the VALERI database show that the land use is the main factor of spatial variability as quantified by the variogram sill. Crop sites are more heterogeneous than natural vegetation and forest sites at the landscape level. The integral range summarizes all structural parameters of the variograin into a single characteristic area. Its square root quantifies the mean length scale (i.e. spatial scale) of the data, which varies between 216 and 1060 in over the 18 landscapes considered. The integral range is also used as a yardstick to judge if the size of an image is large enough to measure properly the length scales of the data with the variogram. We propose that it must be smaller than 5% of the image surface. The theoretical dispersion variance, computed from the variograin model, quantifies the spatial heterogeneity within a moderate resolution pixel. It increases rapidly with pixel size until this size is larger than the mean length scale of the data. Finally based on the analysis of 18 landscapes, the sufficient pixel size to capture the major part of the spatial variability of the vegetation cover at the landscape scale is estimated to be less than 100 m. Since for all the heterogeneous landscapes the loss of NDVI spatial variability was small at this spatial resolution, the bias generated by the intra-pixel spatial heterogeneity on non-linear estimation processes will be reduced.

AB Potentially toxic cyanobacterial blooms occur in the Baltic Sea in the middle of summer. Aggregations of cyanobacteria often form dense subsurface blooms or even surface scum, which are spatially extremely patchy. It has been shown by using bio-optical modelling together with the hyperspectral sensor Hyperion image from the western part of the Gulf of Finland that chlorophyll concentration may vary between one and hundreds of mg m(-3) within the 10-m scale during heavy bloom. The SeaWiFS, MODIS/Aqua and MERIS products over heavy bloom region are compared with each other, the modelling results, with the bio-optical modelling data and the available in situ data. In the early stage of bloom, these sensors give consistent results, which are in the same range as in situ data. During the heavy bloom of cyanobacteria, at the time of surface scum formation, results from different sensors are very variable, the values of chlorophyll concentration may exceed the standard processing limits and atmospheric correction often fails. The good capability of the MERIS and MODIS fine resolution bands to detect cyarrobacterial bloom quantitatively is shown. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper explores the effect of rain intercepted by vegetation and mulch on the L-band emission of natural grass. The study is based on radiometric, meteorological, and biophysical measurements obtained during the SMOSREX Experiment (Toulouse, France). Several approaches were followed to evaluate interception effects. Firstly, the analysis of microwave brightness temperature (TB) measurements at L-band indicated that interception increases vegetation emission at both polarisations. Secondly, the use of microwave indices to detect the presence/absence of interception was examined. In particular, a modified polarisation ratio at 50 degrees was found to be well related to the interception status of the standing vegetation. Finally, the vegetation optical depth (T), which pararneterises the extinction across the vegetation layer, was retrieved from the TB observations. It was found that tau increases with the increase in the water content stored within the vegetation and mulch after rainfall. The study highlights the strong impact of intercepted water in otherwise weakly attenuating covers such as grasses. Interception might therefore be an issue to consider in order to improve soil moisture retrieval algorithms from L-band observations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A detailed 3D structural model of a conifer forest canopy was developed in order to simulate the reflectance (optical) and backscatter (microwave) signals measured remotely. We show it is feasible to model forest canopy scattering using detailed 3D models of tree structure including the location and orientation Of individual needles. An existing structural growth model of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Treegrow, was modified to simulate observed growth stages of a Scots pine canopy from age 5 to 50 years. The 3D tree models showed close structural agreement with in situ measurements. Needles were added to the structural models according to observed phyllotaxy (distribution). Individual trees were used to generate model canopies, which in turn were used to drive optical and microwave models of canopy scattering. Simulated canopy radiometric response was compared with airborne hyperspectral reflectance data (HyMAP) and airborne synthetic aperture RADAR (ASAR) backscatter data. Model simulations agreed well in general with observations, particularly at optical wavelengths where model simulations of low and high density canopy stands were shown to bracket observations. Relatively small sensitivity of observed reflectance to canopy age was captured reasonably well by the simulations. The choice of needle shape and phyllotaxy was shown to have a significant impact on multiple scattering behaviour at the branch scale. In the microwave domain, simulated backscatter values agreed reasonably well with observations at L-band, less so at X-band. L-band simulated backscatter significantly underestimated observed backscatter at younger canopy ages, probably as a result of inappropriate modelling of soil/understory. It is demonstrated that a combined structural and radiometric modelling approach provides a flexible and powerful method for simulating the remotely sensed signal of a forest canopy in the optical and microwave domains. This is particularly useful for exploring the impact of canopy structure on the resulting signal and also for combined retrievals of forest structural parameters from optical and microwave data.

AB Among the various natural hazards, mass movements (MM) are probably the most damaging to the natural and human environment in Mediterranean!, countries, including Lebanon which represents a good case study. This research deals with how to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for establishing the relationships between MM occurrence and different factor terrain parameters over a representative region of Lebanon. Parameters expressed by: 1-ancillary data like lithology, proximity to fault zone, soil type, land cover/use, distance to drainage line and rainfall quantity, and 2-derived data like slope gradient and slope aspect, were correlated with MM using GIS-approaches. The MM were first detected through visual interpretation of two stereo-pairs of SPOT 4 images (anaglyph) at 10 in resolution. This study indicates, depending on bivariate Remote Sensing and GIS statistical correlations (Kendall Tau-b correlation), that the lithology is the most influencing factor on MM occurrence. It also shows that statistical correlations to mass movements exist best between factors at the following decreasing order of importance: lithology-proximity to fault line, lithology-soil type and lithology - distance to drainage line at 1% level of significance, and soil-land cover/use, slope aspect-land cover/use, and soil-slope gradient at 5% level of significance. These correlations were verified and checked through field observations and explained using univariate statistical correlations. Therefore, they could be extrapolated to other Mediterranean countries having similar geoenvironmental conditions. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this paper was to serve as a pilot study for running a physically based forest reflectance model through an operational forest management data base in Finnish coniferous forests. The LAI values of 250 boreal coniferous stands were retrieved with the physically based model by inversion from a SPOT HRVIR1 image. The use of three spectral vegetation indices (NDVI, RSR and MSI) in LAI estimation was tested for the same stands. Ground-truth LAI was based on an allometric model which can be applied to routine stand inventory data. Stand reflectances were computed as an average of reflectances of the pixels located within the digital stand borders.
   The relationships of LAI and spectral vegetation indices calculated from the SPOT data were very scattered. RSR exhibited the widest range of values (and the highest correlation with LAI), suggesting it to be more dynamic than MSI or NDVI. Inversion of the reflectance model was done twice: first using as simultaneous input three wavelength bands (red, NIR and MIR), then only the red and NIR bands. The aim was to observe whether including the MIR band in the inversion would improve the inverted LAI estimates or if using only the red and NIR bands would result in the same reliability of inverted values. The motivation for examining the influence of the MIR band resulted from several recent studies from the boreal zone which suggest that the pronounced understory effect could be minimized by the inclusion of the MIR band. The LAI values inverted by the model were slightly larger than the ground-truth LAI values. A minor improvement in LAI estimates was observed after the inclusion of the MIR band in reflectance model inversion. The errors in the ground-truth LAI were uncertain and the background understory reflectance was expected to be highly variable. Thus, the quality of the data used may be to a large extent responsible for the observed low utility of the tested channels. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of accurate and timely information describing the nature and extent of land resources and changes over time is increasing, especially in rapidly growing metropolitan areas. We have developed a methodology to map and monitor land cover change using multitemporal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data in the seven-county Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota for 1986, 1991, 1998, and 2002. The overall seven-class classification accuracies averaged 514% for the four years. The overall accuracy of land cover change maps, generated from post-classification change detection methods and evaluated using several approaches, ranged from 80% to 90%. The maps showed that between 1986 and 2002 the amount of urban or developed land increased from 23.7% to 32.8% of the total area, while rural cover types of agriculture, forest and wetland decreased from 69.6% to 60.5%. The results quantify the land cover change patterns in the metropolitan area and demonstrate the potential of multitemporal Landsat data to provide an accurate, economical means to map and analyze changes in land cover over time that can be used as inputs to land management and policy decisions.

AB Extensive, in situ, reflectance spectra (i.e., 252 bands) were acquired for the dominant botanical and substrate classes within Prentiss Bay and Horseshoe Bay, Lake Huron. These spectral radiance measurements were transformed into relative percent reflectance and then resampled to emulate the band configurations of the airborne, hyperspectral imagery that was also acquired of the sites. Second-derivative analysis was applied to these transformed spectra in order to identify which spectral bands were the most botanically explanative (i.e., optimal) for the differentiation of coastal wetland vegetation in the Great Lakes.
   This research identified 8 optimal bands in the visible-NIR wavelength region (in order of decreasing importance: 685.5, 731.5, 939.9, 514.9, 812.3, 835.5, 823.9 and 560.1 nm) that appear to contain the majority of the coastal wetland information content of the full spectral resolution, 48-band, hyperspectral signatures. A reduction of band number without significant information loss is important because it makes it practical to utilize small pixels without fear of sacrificing the ability to differentiate the botanical communities.

AB Large-scale surface atmospheric convergence and divergence patterns in the Indian Ocean are mapped using high-spatial resolution, merged scatterometer wind vectors during 1991-2000. The convergence zone evolves to north of 15 degrees S as a result of convection promoted by warm (>28 degrees C) equatorial sea surface temperature (SST), and it exhibits strong intensity during boreal summer and winter. A divergence zone evolves to the south of 15 degrees S as a result of subdued convection caused by colder SST (<24 degrees C) that reduces outgoing long-wave radiation; it exhibits enhanced intensity in the eastern Indian Ocean during boreal winter. The interannual variability shows that the divergence in the eastern Indian Ocean lags its western counterpart by 5 - 7 months. The convergence in the eastern Indian Ocean is stronger than its western counterpart during boreal summer. Relationship between Southern Oscillation Index and spatially averaged convergence time series indicate that the latter weakened during strong El Nino years 1994 and 1997. spatially averaged divergence time series show a near-contemporaneous relationship with all-India rainfall, with a temporal lag of 1 similar to 2 months.

AB Monitoring and understanding plant phenology are important in the context of studies of terrestrial productivity and global change., Vegetation phenology, such as dates of onsets of greening up and leaf senescence, has been determined by remote sensing using mainly the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). In boreal regions, the results suffer from significant uncertainties because of the effect of snow on NDVI. In this paper, SPOT VEGETATION S10 data over Siberia have been analysed to define a more appropriate method. The analysis of time series of NDVI, normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI), together with an analysis of in situ phenological records in Siberia, shows that the vegetation phenology can be detected using NDWI, with small effect of snow. In spring, the date of onset of greening up is taken as the date at which NDWI starts increasing, since NDWI decreases with snowmelt and increases with greening up. In the fall, the date of onset of leaf coloring is taken as the date at which NDWI starts decreasing, since NDWI decreases with senescence and increases with snow accumulation. The results are compared to the results obtained using NDVI-based methods, taking in situ phenological records as the reference. NDWI gives better estimations of the start of greening up than NDVI (reduced RMSE, bias and dispersions, and higher correlation), whereas it does not improve the determination of the start of leaf coloring. A map of greening up dates in central Siberia obtained from NDWI is shown for year 2002 and the reliability of the method is discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a novel approach to generating regional scale aboveground biomass estimates for tree species of the Lake Tahoe Basin using hyperspatial (<1 m(2) ground resolution) remote sensing imagery. Tree crown shadows were identified and delineated as individual polygons. The area of shadowed vegetation for each tree was related to two tree structural parameters, diameter-at-breast height (DBH) and crown area. We found we could detect DBH and crown area with reasonable accuracy (field measured to image derived cross correlation results were 0.67 and 0.77 for DBH and crown area, respectively). Furthermore, the counts of the delineated polygons in a region generated overstory stem densities validated to manually photointerpreted stem densities (photointerpreted vs. image-derived stem densities correlation was 0.87). We demonstrate with accurate classification maps and allometric equations relating DBH or crown area to biomass, that these crown-level parameters can be used to generate regional scale biomass estimates without the signal saturation common to coarse-scale optical and RADAR sensors.

AB Bio-optical algorithms for remote estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl) in case-1 waters exploit the upwelling radiation in the blue and green spectral regions. In turbid productive waters other constituents, that vary independently of Chl, absorb and scatter light in these spectral regions. As a consequence, the accurate estimation of Chl in turbid productive waters has so far not been feasible from satellite sensors. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent to which near-infrared (NIR) to red reflectance ratios could be applied to the Sea Wide Field-of-View Sensor (ScaWiFS) and the Moderate Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) to estimate (Chl in productive turbid waters. To achieve this objective, remote-sensing reflectance spectra and relevant water constituents were collected in 25 1 stations over takes and reservoirs with a wide variability in optical parameters (i.e. 4 <= Chl <= 240 mg m (3): 18 <= Seechi disk depth <= 308 cm), SeaWiFS and MODIS NIR and red reflectances were simulated by using the in-situ hyperspectral data. The proposed algorithms predicted Chl with a relative random uncertainty of approximately 28% (average bias between -1% and -41%), Tile effects of reflectance uncertainties on the predicted Chl were also analyzed. It was found that, for realistic ranges of R-cs uncertainties, Chl could be estimated with a precision better than 40% and an accuracy better than +/- 35%. These findings imply that, provided that an atmospheric correction scheme specific for the red-NIR spectral region is available, the extensive database of SeaWiFS and MODIS images Could be used to quantitatively monitor Chl in turbid productive waters.

AB The temperature-independent thermal infrared spectral indices (TISI) method is employed for the separation of land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity from surface radiances (atmospherically corrected satellite data). The daytime reflected solar irradiance and the surface emission at similar to 3.8 mu m have comparable magnitudes. Using surface radiances and a combination of day-night 2-channel TISI ratios, the similar to 3.8 gm reflectivity is derived. For implementing the TISI method, coefficients for NOAA 9-16 AVHRR channels are obtained. A numerical analysis with simulated surface radiances shows that for most surface types (showing nearly Lambertian behavior) the achievable accuracy is similar to 0.005 for emissivity (AVHRR channel-5) and similar to 1.5 K for LST. Data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is used for calculation of atmospheric attenuation. Comparisons are made over a part of central Europe on two different dates (seasons). Clouds pose a major problem to surface observations; hence, monthly emissivity composites are derived. Additionally, using TISI-based monthly composites of emissivities, a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based method is tuned to the particular study area and the results are intercompared. Once the coefficients are known, the NDVI method is easily implemented but holds well only for vegetated areas. The error of the NDVI-based emissivities (with respect to the TISI results) ranges between -0.038 and 0.032, but for vegetated areas the peak of the error-histogram is at similar to 0.002. The algorithm for retrieving emissivity via TISI was validated with synthetic data. Due to the different spatial scales of satellite and surface measurements and the lack of homogeneous areas, which are representative for low-resolution pixels and ground measurements, ground-validation is a daunting task. However, for operational products ground-truth validation is necessary. Therefore, also an approach to identify suitable validation sites for meteorological satellite products in Europe is described.

AB Numerous studies have reported on the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and leaf area index (LAI), but the seasonal and annual variability of this relationship has been less explored. This paper reports a study of the NDVI-LAI relationship through the years from 1996 to 2001 at a deciduous forest site. Six years of LAI patterns from the forest were estimated using a radiative transfer model with input of above and below canopy measurements of global radiation, while NDVI data sets were retrieved from composite NDVI time series of various remote sensing sources, namely NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR; 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2000), SPOT VEGETATION (1998-2001), and Terra MODIS (2001). Composite NDVI was first used to remove the residual noise based on an adjusted Fourier transform and to obtain the NDVI time-series for each day during each year.
   The results suggest that the NDVI-LAI relationship can vary both seasonally and inter-annually in tune with the variations in phenological development of the trees and in response to temporal variations of environmental conditions. Strong linear relationships are obtained during the leaf production and leaf senescence periods for all years, but the relationship is poor during periods of maximum LAI, apparently due to the saturation of NDVI at high values of LAI. The NDVI-LAI relationship was found to be poor (R 2 varied from 0.39 to 0.46 for different sources of NDVI) when all the data were pooled across the years, apparently due to different leaf area development patterns in the different years. The relationship is also affected by background NDVI but this could be minimized by applying relative NDVI.
   Comparisons between AVHRR and VEGETATION NDVI revealed that these two had good linear relationships (R-2=0.74 for 1998 and 0.63 for 2000). However, VEGETATION NDVI data series had some unreasonably high values during beginning and end of each year period, which must be discarded before adjusted Fourier transform processing. MODIS NDVI had values greater than 0.62 through the entire year in 2001, however, MODIS NDVI still showed an "M-shaped" pattern as observed for VEGETATION NDVI in 2001. MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was the only index that exhibited a poor linear relationship with LAI during the leaf senescence period in year 2001. The results suggest that a relationship established between the LAI and NDVI in a particular year may not be applicable in other years, so attention must be paid to the temporal scale when applying NDVI-LAI relationships.

AB The Tropospheric Water Vapour and Stratospheric Ozone (TROPWA) project has measured ground-based stratospheric ozone by means of millimetre wave radiometry tuned at 142 GHz from 1993 to 2000 in Mendoza, Argentina. Additionally, tropospheric water vapour was measured using a 92-GHz radiometer. This paper presents the theoretical error analysis used to characterize the ozone instrument, and a comparative study of the retrieved profiles with the coincident measurements taken with different instruments. To evaluate and validate the retrieved stratospheric ozone profiles, we have used a set of ozone profiles measured with the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE); while the water vapour data was calibrated against a set of 3-year-radiosounding-balloon data taken by the Argentine National Weather Service. This study also includes a comparison of individual ozone profiles measured using a second ground-based millimetre wave radiometer-spectrometer tuned at 276 GHz from the Max-Planck-Institut fur Aeronomie (MPAE), Germany. During this particular campaign carried out in November 1994, the ground-based measurements were contrasted with two space-born experiments: the Millimetre Wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS), flown in the NASA-ATLAS 3 mission and the above-mentioned HALOE.
   From the error analysis and the comparison tests, it follows that between 20 to 40 km the TROPWA instrument is able to retrieve ozone profiles with absolute errors varying from 10% to 20%, relative errors less than 5%, and with a height resolution, calculated as full width at half maximum (FWHM), varying from 5 to 11 km depending on the altitude. The major discrepancies between the different set of profiles are about +8% to -10% (+0.4 to -0.8 ppmv), mainly due to the coarser height resolution of our instrument. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB A study was conducted to determine the feasibility of obtaining estimates of vegetation canopy height from digital elevation data collected during the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). The SRTM sensor mapped 80% of the Earth's land mass with a C-band Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) instrument, producing the most complete digital surface map of Earth. Due to the relatively short wavelength (5.6 cm) of the SRTM instrument, the majority of incoming electromagnetic energy is reflected by scatterers located within the vegetation canopy at heights well above the "bald-Earth" surface. Interferometric SAR theory provides a basis for properly identifying and accounting for the dependence of this scattering phase center height on both instrument and target characteristics, including relative and absolute vertical error and vegetation structural attributes.
   An investigation to quantify the magnitude of the vertical error component was conducted using SRTM data from two vegetation-free areas in Iowa and North Dakota, revealing absolute errors of -4.0 and -1.1 m, respectively. It was also shown that the relative vertical error due to phase noise can be reduced significantly through sample averaging. The relative error range for the Iowa site was reduced from 13 to 4 in and for the North Dakota site from 7 to 3 in after averaging of 50 samples. Following error reduction, it was demonstrated that the SRTM elevation data can be successfully correlated via linear regression models with ground-measured canopy heights acquired during the general mission timeframe from test sites located in Georgia and California. Prior to outlier removal and phase noise reduction, initial adjusted r(2) values for the Georgia and California sites were 0.15 and 0.20, respectively. Following outlier analysis and averaging of at least 20 SRTM pixels per observation, adjusted r(2) values for the Georgia and California sites improved to 0.79 (rmse=l.l m) and 0.75 (rmse=4.5 m), respectively. An independent validation of a novel bin-based modeling strategy designed for reducing phase noise in sample plot data confirmed both the robustness of the California model (adjusted r(2)=0.74) as well as the capacity of the binning strategy to produce stable models suitable for inversion (validated rmse=4.1 m). The results suggest that a minimum mapping unit of approximately 1.8 ha is appropriate for SRTM-based vegetation canopy height mapping. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The paper discusses an application of the TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) altimetry data to estimate the discharge of one of the largest Arctic rivers-the Ob' river. We first discuss the methodology to select and retrieve the altimeter water levels during the various phases of the hydrological regime. Then we establish the relationships between the satellite-derived water levels and the in situ river discharge measurements at the Salekhard gauging station near the Ob' estuary. The comparison of in situ and satellite-derived estimations of the Ob' discharge at Salekhard shows that the T/P data can successfully be used for hydrological studies of this river. We address the problems affecting the accuracy of the discharge estimations from altimeter measurements, identify potential solutions and suggest how satellite altimetry data may benefit hydrological studies of Arctic rivers.

AB High concentrations of suspended particulate matter in coastal waters directly affect or govern numerous water column and benthic processes. The concentration of suspended sediments derived from bottom sediment resuspension or discharge of sediment-laden rivers is highly variable over a wide range of time and space scales. Although there has been considerable effort to use remotely sensed images to provide synoptic maps of suspended particulate matter, there are limited routine applications of this technology due in part to the low spatial resolution, long revisit period, or cost of most remotely sensed data. In contrast, near daily coverage of mediumresolution data is available from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra instrument without charge from several data distribution gateways. Equally important, several display and processing programs are available that operate on low cost computers.
   The utility of MODIS 250 m data for analyzing complex coastal waters was examined in the Northern Gulf of Mexico. Using simple processing procedures, MODIS images were used to map the concentration of Total Suspended Matter (TSM). A robust linear relationship was established between band 1 (620-670 nm) MODIS Terra 250 m data and in situ measurements of TSM (r(2) = 0. 89; n = 52; MSE=4.74) acquired during six field campaigns. This study demonstrates that the moderately high resolution of MODIS 250 m data and the operating characteristics of the instrument provide data useful for examining the transport and fate of materials in coastal environments, particularly smaller bodies of water such as bays and estuaries.

AB A new integrated approach, involving continuum-removed absorption features, the red edge position and neural networks, is developed and applied to map grass nitrogen concentration in an African savanna rangeland. Nitrogen, which largely determines the nutritional quality of grasslands, is commonly the most limiting nutrient for grazers. Therefore, the remote sensing of foliar nitrogen concentration in savanna rangelands is important for an improved understanding of the distribution and feeding patterns of wildlife. Continuum removal was applied on two absorption features located in the visible (R550-757) and the SWIR (R2015-2199) from an atmospherically corrected HYMAP MKI image. A feature selection algorithm was used to select wavelength variables from the absorption features. Selected band depths from the absorption features as well as the red edge position (REP) were input into a backpropagation neural network. The best-trained neural network was used to map nitrogen concentration over the whole study area. Results indicate that the new integrated approach could explain 60% of the variation in savanna grass nitrogen concentration on an independent test data set, with a root mean square error (rmse) of 0.13 (+/- 8.30% of the mean observed nitrogen concentration). This result is better compared to the result obtained using multiple linear regression, which yielded an R-2 of 38%, with a RMSE of 0.16 (+/- 10.30% of the mean observed nitrogen concentration) on an independent test data set. The study demonstrates the potential of airborne hyperspectral data and neural networks to estimate and ultimately to map nitrogen concentration in the mixed species environments of Southern Africa.

AB In this study, the consistency of systematic retrievals of surface reflectance and leaf area index was assessed using overlap regions in adjacent Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper-Plus (ETM+) scenes. Adjacent scenes were acquired within 7-25 days apart to minimize variations in the land surface reflectance between acquisition dates. Each Landsat ETM+ scene was independently geo-referenced and atmospherically corrected using a variety of standard approaches. Leaf area index (LAI) models were then applied to the surface reflectance data and the difference in LAI between overlapping scenes was evaluated. The results from this analysis show that systematic LAI retrieval from Landsat ETM+ imagery using a baseline atmospheric correction approach that assumes a constant aerosol optical depth equal to 0.06 is consistent to within +/- 0.61 LAI units. The average absolute difference in LAI retrieval over all 10 image pairs was 26% for a mean LAI of 2.05 and the maximum absolute difference over any one pair was 61% for a mean LAI of 1.13. When no atmospheric correction was performed on the data, the consistency in LAI retrieval was improved by 1%. When a scene-based dense, dark vegetation atmospheric correction algorithm was used, the LAI retrieval differences increased to 28% for a mean LAI of 2.32. This implies that a scene-based atmospheric correction procedure may improve the absolute accuracy of LAI retrieval without having a major impact on retrieval consistency. Such consistency trials provide insight into the current limits concerning surface reflectance and LAI retrieval from fine spatial resolution remote sensing imagery with respect to the variability in clear-sky atmospheric conditions.

AB Subpixel land cover mapping involves the estimation of surface properties using sensors whose spatial sampling is coarse enough to produce mixtures of the properties within each pixel. This study evaluates five algorithms for mapping subpixel land cover fractions and continuous fields of vegetation properties within the BOREAS study area. The algorithms include a conventional "hard", per-pixel classifier, a neural network, a clustering/look-up-table approach, multivariate regression, and linear least squares inversion. A land cover map prepared using a Landsat TM mosaic was adopted as the source of fine scale calibration and validation data. Coarse scale mixtures of five basic land cover classes and continuous vegetation fields, both corresponding to the field of view of SPOT-VEGETATION imagery (1.15-km pixel size), were synthesised from the TM mosaic using a modelled point spread function. Two measures of land cover distribution were used, fractions of fine scale land cover categories and continuous fields of vegetation structural characteristics. The subpixel algorithms were applied using both proximate (<100 km) and distant (>400 km) separation between training and validation regions. "Hard" classification performed poorly in estimating proportions or continuous fields. The neural network, look-up-table and multivariate regression algorithms produced good matches of spatial patterns and regional land cover composition for the proximate treatment. However, all three methods exhibited substantial biases with the distant treatment due to the characteristics of the training data. Linear least squares inversion offers a relatively unbiased but less precise alternative for subpixel proportion and fraction mapping as it avoids calibration to the a priori distribution of land cover in the training data. In general, a combination of multivariate regression for proximate training data and linear least squares inversion for distant training data resulted in woody fraction estimates within 20% of the Landsat TM classification-based estimates.

AB In this paper, we examine the behavior of the Vietnam coastal upwelling during the 1997-1998 El Nino-Southem Oscillation (ENSO) event. The baseline is 4 years of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sea surface temperature (SST) data taken from 1997 to 2000. Comparison of upwelling images to simultaneous ERS-2 (European Remote Sensing Satellite) wind fields indicates that the summer monsoon winds constitute a major generation forcing. During the 1997 El Nino, the monsoon winds enhanced the upwelling and induced the upwelling center to move southward. During the 1998 La Nino, the monsoon winds weakened the upwelling. In contrast with the tropical Pacific, in the study area, La Nina implies a warm event and El Nino a cold event. We use empirical orthogonal function (EOF) methods to analyze the spatial and temporal variance of the upwelling. The three principal modes account for 37%, 15%, and 8% of the total variance, respectively. The first EOF modes reveal that the SST variance in the north and south subregions underwent a positive-negative sign switch in summer 1997. The second EOF modes represent the monthly evolution in normal years. The third modes seem to be sensitive to the 1998 La Nina event. Simultaneous TOPEX/POSEIDON and ERS-2 altimeter data provide further evidence for our analysis. Comparison with California coastal upwelling and mid-Atlantic Bight (MAB) coastal upwelling indicates that the Vietnam coastal upwelling is the most intensive one. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB The magnitude of the anisotropy of vegetation is mainly determined by its spectral and structural features. It can be described by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). The parameters of physical BRDF models are related to the biophysical structural information. However, for a semiempirical kernel-based BRDF model, the relationship between BRDF parameters and vegetation structure is no longer as clear as with a physical BRDF model. To reveal this relationship, a structural scattering index (SSI) and a relative structural scattering index (RSSI) are derived based on the BRDF parameters in this paper. The investigation of SSI and RSSI show that they have both theoretical and practical meaning and can be used to distinguish different land cover types or to detect structural changes.

AB Surface soil moisture is a key variable used to describe water and energy exchanges at the land surface/atmosphere interface. Passive microwave remotely sensed data have great potential for providing estimates of soil moisture with good temporal repetition on a daily basis and on a regional scale (similar to 10 km). However, the effects of vegetation cover, soil temperature, snow cover, topography, and soil surface roughness also play a significant role in the microwave emission from the surface. Different soil moisture retrieval approaches have been developed to account for the various parameters contributing to the surface microwave emission. Four main types of algorithms can be roughly distinguished depending on the way vegetation and temperature effects are accounted for. These algorithms are based on (i) land cover classification maps, (ii) ancillary remote sensing indexes, and (iii) two-parameter or (iv) three-parameter retrievals (in this case, soil moisture, vegetation optical depth, and effective surface temperature are retrieved simultaneously from the microwave observations). Methods (iii) and (iv) are based on multiconfiguration observations, in terms of frequency, polarization, or view angle. They appear to be very promising as very few ancillary information are required in the retrieval process. This paper reviews these various methods for retrieving surface soil moisture from microwave radiometric systems. The discussion highlights key issues that will have to be addressed in the near future to secure operational use of the proposed retrieval approaches. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB A series of experiments carried out in a controlled environment facility to induce steady-state chlorophyll a fluorescence variation demonstrate that natural fluorescence emission is observable on the derivative reflectance spectra as a double-peak feature in the 690 - 710 nm spectral region. This work describes that the unexplained double-peak feature previously seen on canopy derivative reflectance is due entirely to chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) effects, demonstrating the importance of derivative methods for fluorescence detection in vegetation. Measurements were made in a controlled environmental chamber where temperature and humidity were varied through the time course of the experiments in both short- and long-term trials using Acer negundo ssp. californium canopies. Continuous canopy reflectance measurements were made with a spectrometer on healthy and stressed vegetation, along with leaf-level steady-state fluorescence measurements with the PAM-2000 Fluorometer during both temperature-stress induction and recovery stages. In 9-h trials, temperatures were ramped from 10 to 35 degreesC and relative humidity adjusted from 92% to 42% during stress induction, returning gradually to initial conditions during the recovery stage. Canopy reflectance difference calculations and derivative analysis of reflectance spectra demonstrate that a double-peak feature created between 688, 697 and 710 nm on the derivative reflectance is a function of natural steady-state fluorescence emission, which gradually diminished with induction of maximum stress. Derivative reflectance indices based on this double-peak feature are demonstrated to track natural steady-state fluorescence emission as quantified by two indices, the double-peak index (DPi) and the area of the double peak (A(dp)). Results obtained employing these double-peak indices from canopy derivative reflectance suggest a potential for natural steady-state fluorescence detection with hyperspectral data. Short- and long-term stress effects on the observed double-peak derivative indices due to pigment degradation and canopy structure changes were studied, showing that both indices are capable of tracking steady-state fluorescence changes from canopy remote sensing reflectance.

AB Although previous investigations have demonstrated reliable empirical relationships between satellite data and nearly contemporaneous ground observations, satellite imagery has not been incorporated into routine lake monitoring programs, This paper focuses on key issues involved in applying satellite imagery to the regional assessment of lake clarity. Ten Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images and four Multispectral Scanner (MSS) images of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA) spanning 25 years (1973-1998) were analyzed. Based on this analysis, recommendations are made for a Landsat-based procedure for water clarity assessment. Closeness of fit(r(2) values) of regression models between satellite brightness data and measured Secchi disk transparency (SDT) decreased with increasing size of the time window between image collection and ground observation of SDT. Use of SDT data collected within +/-1 day of the image date is recommended. but where SDT data are limited. windows up to 7 days yield reasonable results, especially in late summer when water clarity is relatively constant. Average brightness data from at least nine pixels in the deep open area of a take should be used to predict take clarity. but the accuracy of predicted SDT did not improve much as the number of pixels in the area of interest (AOI) increased above this value, A three-coefficient regression model using the TM1/TM3 ratio and TM1 was a consistent and reliable predictor of SDT (r(2) values of .7-.8). A similar relationship involving the MSS1/MSS2 ratio and MSS1 was a reasonable predictor of SDT for MSS data. Efforts to produce a standard prediction equation for SDT applicable to images collected on different dates were not successful, but a simple regression procedure to account for differences in atmospheric conditions among image collection dates substantially decreased the range of coefficients in the regression model.

AB Accurate estimates of the total biomass in terrestrial vegetation are important I-or carbon dynamics Studies at a variety of scales. Although aboveground biomass is difficult to quantify over large areas using traditional techniques, lidar remote sensing holds great promise for biomass estimation because it directly measures components of canopy Structure such as canopy height and the vertical distribution of intercepted canopy surfaces. In this study, our primary goal was to explore the sensitivity of lidar to differences in canopy structure and aboveground biomass in a dense, neotropical rainforest. We first examined the relationship between simple vertical canopy profiles derived from field measurements and the estimated aboveground biomass (EAGB) across a range of field plots located in primary and secondary tropical rainforest and in agroforesty areas. We found that metrics from field-derived vertical canopy profiles arc highly Correlated (R-2 up to .94) with EAGB across the entire range of conditions sampled. Next, we found that vertical canopy profiles from a large-footprint lidar instrument were closely related with coincident field profiles, and that metrics from both field and lidar profiles are highly correlated. As a result. metrics from lidar profiles are also highly correlated (R-2 up to .94) with EAGB across this neotropical landscape. These results help to explain the nature of the relationship between lidar data and EAGB, and also lay the foundation to explore the generality of the relationship between vertical canopy profiles and biomass in other tropical regions.

AB Light use efficiency (LUE) algorithms are a potentially effective approach to monitoring global net primary production (NPP) using satellite-borne sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, these algorithms are applied at relatively coarse spatial resolutions 1 km, which may subsume significant heterogeneity in vegetation LUE (epsilon(n), g MJ(-1) and, hence, introduce error. To examine the effects of spatial heterogeneity on a LUE algorithm, imagery from the Advanced very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at 1-km resolution was used to implement a LUE approach for NTP estimation over a 25-km(2) area of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max Merr.) in central Illinois, USA. Results from several E. formulations were compared with a NIPP reference surface based on measured NPPs and a high spatial resolution land cover surface derived from Landsat ETM+. Determination of E. based on measurements of biomass production and monitoring of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) revealed that E of soybean was 68% of that for corn. When a LUE algorithm for estimating NTPP was implemented in the study area using the assumption of homogeneous cropland and the En for corn, the estimate for total biomass production was 126% of that from the NPP reference surface. Because of counteracting errors, total biomass production using the soybean epsilon(n) was closer (86%) to that from the NPP reference surface. Retention of high spatial resolution land cover to assign epsilon(n) resulted in a total NPP very similar to the reference NPP because differences in leaf phenology between the crop types were small except early in the growing season. These results suggest several alternative approaches to accounting for land cover heterogeneity in E. when implementing LUE algorithms at coarse resolution. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

TI Impact of sensor's point spread function on land cover characterization:

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID RESTORATION; MODIS
AB Measured and modeled point spread functions (PSF) of sensor systems indicate that a significant portion of the recorded signal of each pixel of a satellite image originates from outside the area represented by that pixel, This hinders the ability to derive surface information from satellite images on a per-pixel basis, In this study. the impact of the PSF of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m bands was assessed using four images representing different landscapes. Experimental results showed that though differences between pixels derived with and without PSF effects were small on the average, the PSF generally brightened dark objects and darkened bright objects. This impact of the PSF lowered the performance of a Support vector machine (SVM) classifier by 5.4% in overall accuracy and increased the overall root mean square error (RMSE) by 2.4% in estimating subpixel percent land cover. An inversion method based on the known PSF model reduced the signals originating from surrounding areas by as much as 53%. This method differs from traditional PSF inversion deconvolution methods in that the PSF was adjusted with lower weighting factors for signals originating from neighboring pixels than those specified by the PSF model. By using this deconvolution method, the lost classification accuracy due to residual impact of PSF effects was reduced to only 1.66% in overall accuracy. The increase in the RMSE of estimated subpixel land cover proportions clue to the residual impact of PSF effects was reduced to 0.64%. Spatial aggregation also effectively reduced the errors in estimated land cover proportion images. About 50% of the estimation errors were removed after applying the deconvolution method and aggregating derived proportion images to twice their dimensional pixel size.

AB The NOAA series of meteorological satellites that carry the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) suffer from orbital drift so that during each satellite's duty period the overpass time occurs later in the day. Replacement satellites restore the overpass time temporarily, but then it gradually decays. The goals of this paper are to document the effects of variable observation time owing to orbital drift on brightness temperatures (BT) and land surface temperature (LST) calculated from them in the NOAA/NASA Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) data set and to consider possible corrections for the resulting trends and discontinuities in the PAL BT data. The drift effects were found to be greater for bare ground than for vegetated land cover classes, however significant effects were found for most vegetated classes. The magnitude of the orbital drift effect for most global cover types was at least as large as the other errors that affect LST measurement. A simple empirical correction for observation time based on solar zenith angle (SZA) was used to correct the PAL BT time series following Gutman [Int. J. Remote Sens. 20 (1999a) 3407]. The correction from this method was compared with that predicted by a physically based model and was found to differ in the early part of each satellite's duty cycle. Finally, the impacts of correction on the effective observation time were analyzed and the simple statistical correction was found to suffer from greater variability than has hitherto been recognized. A modification to the statistical correction to adjust the effective observation time is described. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines, on global and continental spatial scales, the relationship between surface meteorological observations retrieved from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Comparisons of spatial and temporal patterns of surface temperature, air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit were carried out using data acquired between January 1989 and December 1990 on a monthly time step. These variables play an important role in hydrological, ecological, and land surface-atmosphere interactions. Additional comparisons were done for seven large regions (ca. 10(6) km(2)) centered on the continental land surface areas in order to test for regional differences and to reduce the effect of coastal transition zones on spatial resampling. The mean statistical differences between the TOVS and AVHRR estimates were 5 degreesC for surface temperature, 4 degreesC for air temperature, and 1.5 kPa for vapor pressure deficit. In addition to long-term and spatially extensive ground data sets, these comparisons provide independent validation of different estimation methods using various satellite sensor measurements resampled to comparable spatial scales. Favorable comparison of the two sensors considered here provide greater confidence in the use of these data sets for global monitoring and modeling applications. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

ID REMOTELY-SENSED DATA; IMAGE SEGMENTATION; COVER CHANGE; CLASSIFICATION
AB A 12-year Landsat-Thematic Mapper (TM) time series (1987-1999) was used for mapping and monitoring evolution of degraded areas caused by independent miners ("garimpeiros") in the search for gold and diamond. Discrimination of target areas was achieved through third principal component images, due to their best enhancement of bare soil areas relative to the surrounding savanna vegetated terrain. A postclassification approach, based on image segmentation/region classification techniques, was used to map degraded areas. This procedure allowed to save time and to curtail inherent subjectivity commonly involved in visual interpretation, producing accurate land-cover change maps. According to these maps. degraded areas comprise 94.4 ha in 1987. 286.4 ha in 1991, and 404.4 ha in 1994. After "garimpeiros" abandoned the region sometime prior to 1994, vegetation soon started recovering mined areas as shown in images acquired in 1995, 1996, and 1999. According to these images, degraded areas decreased to 311.2, 283.7, and 246.2 ha, respectively. Data also indicate that vegetation regrowth is faster near the border of degraded areas, and becomes slower to the center of these areas, where damage process is more intense. Based on the satellite images-derived regrowth rates. it is possible to infer that degraded areas would not be entirely recovered by vegetation by the year 2019. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Mapping forest variables and associated characteristics is fundamental for forest planning and management. Considerable effort has been made in Northern Europe to develop techniques for wall-to-wall mapping of forest variables. Following that work, we describe the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method for improving estimation and to produce wall-to-wall basal area, volume, and cover type maps, in the context of the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) monitoring system. Several variations within the kNN were tested, including: distance metric, weighting function, feature weighting parameters, and number of neighbors. Specific procedures to incorporate ancillary information and image enhancement techniques were also tested. Using the nearest neighbor (k = 1), Euclidean distance, a three date 18-band composite image, and feature weighting parameters, maps were constructed for basal area, volume, and cover type. The empirical, bootstrap based, 95% confidence interval for the basal area root mean square error (MSE) is (8.21, 9.02) m(2)/ha and for volume (48.68, 54.58) m(3)/ha. For the 13 FIA forest cover type classes, results indicated useful map accuracy and the choice of k = 1 retained the full range of forest types present in the region. The 95% confidence interval, obtained using the bootstrap 0.632+ technique, for the overall accuracy (OA) in the 13 cover type classification was (0.4952, 0.5459).

AB Rice monitoring and production estimation has special significance to China, as rice is the staple grain and accounts for 42% of the crop production in this country. Radar remote sensing is appropriate for monitoring rice because the areas where this crop is cultivated are often cloudy and rainy. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is thus anticipated to be the dominant high-resolution remote sensing data source for agricultural applications in tropical and subtropical regions. IP also provides revisit schedules suitable for agricultural monitoring. This paper presents the results of a study examining the backscatter behavior of rice as a function of time using multitemporal RADARSAT data acquired in 1996 and 1997. A rice-type distribution map was produced, showing four types of rice with different life spans ranging from 80 days to 120 - 125 days. The Life span of a rice crop has significant impact on the yield, as well as on the taste and quality of the rice, with the longer growing varieties having the best taste and the highest productivity. The rice production of three counties and two administrative regions, totaling 5000 km(2), was estimated in this study. The accuracy of the rice classification was found to be 91% (97% after postclassification filtering) providing confidence that multitemporal RADARSAT data is capable of rice mapping. An empirical growth model was then applied to the results of the rice classification, which related radar backscatter values to rice life spans. These life spans could then be used to sum up the production estimates, which were obtained from agronomic models already in use for rice by local agronomists. These models related the yield of rice to their life span based on empirical observations for each type of rice. The resulting productivity estimate could not be compared to any other existing data on yield production for the study-area, but was well received by the local authorities. Based on the studies carried out in the Zhaoqing test site since 1993, it is suggested that rice production estimates require three radar data acquisitions taken at three different stages of crop growth and development. These three growth stages an: at the end of the transplanting and seedling development period, during the ear differentiation period, and at the beginning of the harvest period. Alternatively, if multiparameter radar data is available, only two data acquisitions may be needed. These would be at the end of the transplanting and seedling development period, and at the beginning of the harvest period. This paper also proposes an operational scenario for rice monitoring and production estimation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We observed the evolution of upwelling along the western east of the South China Sea (SCS). The data we used are NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellite AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) IR (infrared) images taken In 1996 and 1997 summer at the HRPT (High Resolution Picture Transmission) receiving station built on Tai-Ping Island, which is located in the central SCS. An upwelling intensity, defined by the total heat loss in the upwelling cold water region, is used to determine the relationship between coastal upwelling and the wind stress derived from the ERS-2 (European Remote Sensing Satellite) data. The results show that the upwelling intensity has a good linens relationship with the total alongshore wind stress while it has a fore: correlation with the cross-shore component of wind stress. These results imply that the alongshore wind stress is the main factor to pump the cold water up to the sea surfacer layer. Meanwhile, the satellite infrared images also indicate that the centroid of cold water moved southward from 15 degreesN to 11 degreesN during the observation period. The size of upwelling area changed as well, and finally evolved into a cold jet stretching offshore along 11 degreesN-12 degreesN in the mid-August 1997. Satellite infrared and altimeteric data short; that the evolution of upwelling region is closely associated with the development of two anticyclonic circulations in the western SCS.

AB Forest inventory method that utilize Landsat TM data mostly assume that all sample plots within the image can be used as ground reference data for any subarea of the image. The assumption about the suitability of the field sample data within a satellite image area was evaluated in this study. The best overall results were obtained when plots within a 20-km range were used in point estimation of plot growing stock volume within a 7x8-km field data network. The estimation procedure was also tested in the calculation of area-level statistics. When the restriction of a 20-km distance was used in volume estimation, the error was always smaller than the sample plot variation and was always smaller than results received from estimates with no distance limit. The best benefits from incorporating satellite data were obtained for the smallest areas using a "20-km distance" restriction. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Farmers must balance the competing goals of supplying adequate N for their crops while minimizing N losses to the environment. To characterize the spatial variability of N over large fields, traditional methods (soil testing, plant tissue analysis, and chlorophyll meters) require many point samples. Because of the close link between leaf chlorophyll and leaf N concentration, remote sensing techniques have the potential to evaluate the N variability over large fields quickly. Our objectives were to (1) select wavelengths sensitive to leaf chlorophyll concentration, (2) stimulate canopy reflectance using a radiative transfer model, and (3) propose a strategy for detecting leaf chlorophyll status of plants using remotely sensed data. A wide range of leaf chlorophyll levels was established in field-grown corn (Zea mays L.) with the application of 8 N levels: 0%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 125%, and 150% of the recommended rate. Reflectance and transmittance spectra of fully expanded upper leaves were acquired over the 400-nm to 1,000-nm wavelength range shortly after anthesis with a spectroradiometer and integrating sphere. Broad-band differences in leaf spectra were observed near 550 nm, 715 nm, and >750 nm. Crop canopy reflectance was simulated using the SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) canopy reflectance model for a wide range of background reflectances, leaf area indices (LAI), and leaf chlorophyll concentrations. Variations in background reflectance and LAI confounded the detection of the relatively subtle differences in canopy reflectance due to changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration. Spectral vegetation indices that combined near-infrared reflectance and red reflectance (e.g. OSAVI and NIR/Red) minimized contributions of background reflectance, while spectral vegetation indices that combined reflectances of near-infrared and other visible bands (MCARI and NIR/Green) were responsive to both leaf chlorophyll concentrations and background reflectance. Pairs of these spectral vegetation indices plotted together produced isolines of leaf chlorophyll concentrations. The slopes of these isolines were linearly related to leaf chlorophyll concentration. A limited test with measured canopy reflectance and leaf chlorophyll data confirmed these results. The characterization of leaf chlorophyll concentrations at the field scale without the confounding problem of background reflectance and LAI variability holds promise as a valuable aid for decision making in managing N applications.

AB The accuracy of the Lassen-Modoc vegetation map was assessed using data from a grid of permanent Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots in conjunction with a fuzzy logic approach. This paper presents the results for the Modoc National Forest. The main foci of this paper are the methods and results for assessing the accuracy of tree size and crown closure classes using a mensurational approach based on calculations made from the plot data. Tl,is approach proved very useful in conjunction with fuzzy accuracy methods. Higher error rates reported for crown closure classes may be due to a variety of factors including error associated with crown closure modeling methods, error associated with crown closure calculations for a plot, and the variability of crown closure within a plot. Using the FIA data has proven to represent a cost-effective,means of generating accuracy assessment information based oil a probability sample. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

These properties allow rapid characterization of the ocean wave environment. In addition to active ranging, the scanning optics can obtain passive measurements of surface emissivity, yielding a digital image of surface brightness in real time. Processed into a binary image, these measurements can provide information on the average statistics and the spatial distribution of breaking waves.

AB During the 1994 SIRC/XSAR mission, part of the scientific activities were devoted to hydrology applications. To complement the shuttle radar data, the helicopter scatterometer ERASME was used on the Orgeval site. As a result, incidence angles ranging from 25 degrees to 57 degrees are available in the C band. Terrain measurements of soil moisture and roughness were also taken. The objective of this study was to take advantage of this data set to improve the geometrical characterization of local soil structure using a fractional Brownian model in order to simulate radar backscattering over agricultural fields. The experimental soil profiles are proved to be locally fractal over a spatial range of a few centimeters (clod structure). The relation between the shape of the correlation function and the fractal dimension is brought to light. A new empirical correlation function is used to adjust the experimental one. It leads to an improvement in the analytic backscattering model Integral Equation Model. Soil profiles, generated with combination between fractional Brownian local structure and global structure with respect to the surface root mean square (rms height) and the correlation length, are used in Moment Method backscattering simulations, which provide results in excellent agreement with radar data.

AB Passive microwave-derived retrieval of terrestrial snow water equivalent (SWE) is strongly influenced by snow-pack wetness. The presence of renter in the crystal matrix inc-eases the microwave emissivity, destroying the between-channel brightness temperature gradient used to make quantitative estimates of SWE. To obtain the most accurate SWE imagery, overpass times from orbiting sensors such as the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/ I) can be chosen so the diurnally coldest and driest snore;pack is being monitored. In this study tee seek to evaluate the role of sensor overpass time when mapping,a SWE by comparing two data sets of 5-day averaged, winter season (December, January, and February) SWE imaging for a ground-validated prairie study area. The first data set is derived from SSM/I morning overpass times, the second from afternoon overpass times. Correlation analysis and modified mean bias error calculations are used to quantify the association between the two data sets. In addition., a series of principal components analysis (PCA) tests have been utilized to quantify the spatial and temporal association between the two time series. Results indicate a strong agreement in SWE retrievals between the two data sets, with little systematic bias that can be attributed to sensor overpass time. Differences in snow-covered areas are more marked, with the morning overpass data consistently estimating greater snow extent. The PCA indicates that the results of time series analysis can be influenced by the choice of sensor overpass time, although the dominant characteristics of the seasonal snow cover evolution are captured by both data sets. Surface temperature data are utilized to illustrate the dependence of algorithm performance on the physical state of the snowpack. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB Liens spectral mixture modeling (LSMM) divides each ground resolution element into its constituent materials using end members which represent the spectral characteristics of the cover types. However, it is difficult to identify and estimate the spectral signature of pure components or endmenbers which form the scene, since they vary with the scale and purpose of the study. We propose three different methods to estimate the spectra of pure components from a set of unknown mixture spectra. Two of the methods consist in different optimization procedures based on objective functions defined from the coordinate axes of the dominant factors. The third one consists it the design of a neural network whose architecture implements the LSMM principles. The different procedures have been tested for the case of three endmembers. First, were used simulated and real data corresponding to mixtures of vegetation and soil. Factors that limit the accuracy of the results, such as the number of channels and the level of data noise have been analyzed. Results have indicated that the three methods provide accurate estimations of the spectral endmembers, especially the third one. Moreover, the second method, that is based on the exploration of the mixture positions in the factor space, has demonstrated to be the most appropriate when the dimensionality of the data is reduced. Finally, this procedure re was applied on a Landsat-5 TM scene. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB We developed and tested a method for analyzing multitemporal satellite imagery using change curves. The method is flexible and allows an analyst to extract specific change parameters from the curves depending on the research question of interest. Eight Landsat TM images of the Mount St. Helens, Washington, blast zone from 1984 to 1995 were geometrically and radiometrically corrected. They were then transformed to estimates of green vegetation cover. Unsupervised clustering was performed on the set of eight transformed images and polynomial curves were fit to the cluster means. From these fitted curves, parameters of interest were extracted and returned to GIS layers, including number of years to reach 10% cover, the greatest rate of cover increase during the study period,, and time-integrated cover. Statistical analysis indicated that the curves did a good job of representing the change trajectories of unclustered pixels. We demonstrated he nse of change curve analysis by analyzing the importance in the revegetation of Mount St. Helens of the different types of disturbance resulting front the volcanic eruption. The change curve analysis is useful in a variety of applications rc;he re the data are continuous, more than two dates of data are available, and the underlying question of interest relates to trends in the data.

AB With the success of launch and initial data processing of Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), there is a great interest in ocean color community to intercompare ocean color data between different ocean color sensors. it is well known that the atmospheric correction, which removes about 90% of sensor-measured signals contributed from atmosphere in the visible, is the key procedure in ocean color imagery data processing. Therefore, it is useful to evaluate the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction algorithm applying to various ocean color sensors. The SeaWiFS atmospheric correction agorithm uses lookup tables which were generated with over similar to 25,000 radiative transfer model runs for different aerosol optical and microphysical properties, solar and viewing geometries, and, in particular, at the eight SeaWiFS spectral bands. Since different ocean color sensors usually have different band spectral characterization, it is rather difficult to apply the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction algorithm to other sensors if one needs to regenerate lookup tables at spectral bands different from SeaWiFS. In this article, we evaluate the accuracy of the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction algorithm for various ocean color sensors using the current SeaWiFS lookup tables. The focus in on the following satellite ocean color sensors: the Modular Optoelectronic Scanner (MOS), the Ocean Color and Temperatures Sensor (OCTS), and the Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER). These sensors have slightly different spectral bands compared with the SeaWiFS. It was found that, with an appropriate calculation of the Rayleigh scattering contributions at each sensor's spectral band and a simple modification in computing the diffuse transmittance of the ocean-atmosphere system, the SeaWiFS atmospheric correction applied to other sensors is as accurate as for SeaWiFS for the solar zenith angles theta(0) less than or equal to 60 degrees.

AB The availability of imaging spectrometers such as AVIRIS, CASI, ROSIS, and HYDICE has created a necessity for spectral methods and models that can predict the performance of these instruments for detecting and estimating water quality parameters in turbid inland and coastal waters as a water quality indicator. The aim of this study is to assess the performance of AVIRIS for estimating the sum of chlorophyll a and pheaophytin (CHL) by means of a sensitivity analysis. The irradiance reflectance R(0-) and, subsequently, the radiance at the sensor were simulated from the water constituent concentrations. These simulations enabled the quantification of the change of L-rs due to variations in CHL. Comparison of these changes with the noise equivalent radiance as specified for AVIRIS gives an indication of the accuracy for AVIRIS in estimating CHL. The biooptical model was calibrated for a coastal and an inland water in The Netherlands. From the simulation results for Lake Ijsselmeer, it was concluded that AVIRIS can estimate chlorophyll a with an accuracy of 20% for relative low CHL values of 10 mg m(-3) and 11-12% for CHL values of more than 30 mg m(-3). A ratio of one of the AVIRIS bands around 713 nm to the band at 677 nm is most sensitive for detecting CHL. For the North Sea the most sensitive bands are found around 530 nm. The estimated accuracy for CHL retrieval ranges from 33% for CHL values of 2 mg m(-3) to 10-12% for CHL of more than 12 mg m(-3). (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1998

AB Forests in the U.S, southwest experience large, intense wildfires. Fire severity maps can assist management of such fire-scarred landscapes. Remote sensing appears suitable for wildfire mapping, provided data have sufficient spatial, radiometric, and spectral resolutions. Using a 1995 Thematic Mapper (TM) post-fire scene of the 8900 ha Rarttesnake Fire in southeastern Arizona as a case study, two linear transformation techniques, the Kauth-Thomas (KT) and principal components analysis (PC) transforms were invoked to enhance Thematic Mapper data prior to supervised classification. The RT and PC transformations were selected to enhance fire-related brightness, greenness, and wetness variations in the image, detecting the extent of different fire severities. The KT transform produced 17% higher overall classification accuracies than the PC transform. The higher accuracy recorded by! the KT transform results fron brightness, greenness, and wetness variations which, in this case, are associated with fire severity. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

ID DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX; AVHRR DATA; RADIOMETER; IMAGES; LAND
AB Five different multitemporal image compositing criteria were compared for the specific aim of monitoring burned areas using AVHRR-GAC 5 km data. Two of them were based on a classical maximum value technique: maximum value composite of NDVI (MVCN) and of surface temperature (MVCTS). Three others were based on a minimum value technique: minimum value composite of Channel 1 (M(i)VCB1), of Channel 2 (M(i)VCB2) and of albedo (M(1)VCA). The compositing period used was 1 week, and four output channels suitable for identifying burned areas were generated: AVHRR Channel 2 (Ch2), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface temperature (T-S), and global environment monitoring index (GEMI). The different compositing criteria were assessed based on their ability to retain burned areas and also on their choice of close to nadir pixels. The separability od burned and unburned areas for each of the compositing criteria was assessed for each of the individual output channels. The criterion that showed best results in terms of separability was M(i)VCA followed very closely by M(1)VCB2; the MVCN criterion clearly showed the least merit of all. An overall analysis of the satellite zenith angles showed that the M(i)VCB2 criterion selected the smallest angles or closer to nadir pixels followed by M(i)VCA, MVCN, MVCTs, and M(i)VCB1. Although impossible to choose a single best compositing criteria in absolute terms, M(i)VCA proved to be the best compromise because it chose near to nadir pixels and performed best in terms of separability between burned and unburned spectral signatures. Future work will determine how to combine different channels (e.g., GEMI, Ch2, T-s, NDVI) for burned area detection, once the M(i)VCA compositing has been performed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

ID CANOPY CHEMISTRY; PROSPECT
AB The conifer leaf model LIBERTY (Leaf Incorporating Biochemistry Exhibiting Reflectance and Transmittance Yields) is an adaptation of radiative transfer theory for determining the optical properties of powders. LIBERTY provides a simulation, at a fine spectral resolution, of quasiinfinite leaf reflectance (as represented by stacked leaves) and single leaf reflectance. Single leaf reflectance and transmittance are important input variables to vegetation canopy reflectance models. A prototype parameterization of LIBERTY was based upon measurements of pine needles and known absorption coefficients of pure component leaf biochemicals. The estimated infinite-reflectance output was compared with the spectra of both dried and fresh pine needles with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 2.87% and 1.73%, respectively. The comparisons between measured and estimated reflectance and transmittance values for single needles were also very accurate with RMSE of 1.84% and 1.12%, respectively. Initial inversion studies have demonstrated that significant improvements can be made to LIBERTY by utilizing in vivo adsorption coefficients which have been determined by the inversion process. These results demonstrate the capability of LIBERTY to model accurately the spectral response of pine needles. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB A sensitivity analysis of C- band (5.3 GHz) and Ku-band (14.85 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to the bare soil moisture content of agricultural fields was conducted in this study. The C-band data were obtained with a 23 degrees incidence angle, whereas the Ku-band data were obtained with 35 degrees, 55 degrees, and 75 degrees incidence angles. The fields presented either a small-scale or an intermediate-scale periodic soil roughness components, associated with level-basin and furrow irrigation systems, respectively. For fields with a small-scale roughness component, the SAR data were sensitive to soil moisture, particularly at the C-band with a 23 degrees incidence angle and Ku-band with a 35 degrees incidence angle. For fields with a intermediate-scale roughness component, both C-and Ku-band data were nearly insensitive to soil moisture. By using a theoretical surface scattering model, this study also analysed the effects of different soil roughness components [root mean square (RMS) height h, correlation length, and periodic row structure] in the SAR data. For fields with RMS height <0.3 cm, a small variation in h (from. 0.1 to 0.3 cm) provoked a significant variation in the SAR data (zip to 8 dB). (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB High resolution aircraft remote sensing imagery and in situ optical data were coupled to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of the inherent optical properties in the near-surf zone off Fort Walton Beach, Florida in August 1994. Upwelling radiance measurements at SeaWiFS wavelengths were collected over a uniform, highly reflective white sand bottom at a ground resolution of 2.5 m using the CASI sensor (Compact Airborne Spectral Imager). Following atmospheric correction, the total remote sensing reflectance signal was partitioned into bottom and water volume reflectance components, using measurements of bottom albedo, water depth, and the diffuse attenuation coefficient at the time of the over-flight. The water components were entered in the Sea-WiFS biooptical model to derive spectral absorption and scattering coefficients. After applying minor algorithm and coefficient adjustments, model results compared favorably with in situ measurements. The biooptical model was subsequently applied to the aircraft imagery to describe the spatial distribution of absorption and scattering. Elevated absorption and particle scattering were observed over the sand bar and shoreward (alpha 555=0.19 m(-1), b555=0.7 m(-1)). The temporal variability of the inherent optical properties over a 1-week period was similar to the spatial variability along a 500-m offshore transect. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Several studies have demonstrated the potential of brightness indices, especially red band reflectance, from Earth resources satellite sensors to estimate vegetation canopy cover and biomass in semiarid savannas as well as in boreal forests. These studies showed that the relation between woody canopy cover and red reflectance varies with geographical location, season, and other factors. This paper models the relation between woody canopy cover and red reflectance, using two simple geometric canopy models developed by Li-Strahler and Jasinski, respectively. Model simulations show that the relation between woody canopy cover and red band reflectance is sensitive to changes in background reflectance, canopy reflectance, solar zenith angle, and topography, which together determine the intercept, slope, and linearity of the relation. The model results provide a theoretical framework that serves as a guide for the most effective conditions for the use of reflectance measurements to estimate canopy cover to be selected a priori. It is predicted that woody canopy cover is best estimated with the use of red band measurements acquired at a solar zenith angle less than 30 degrees in a season when the contrast between background reflectance and canopy reflectance is the largest during the year.

AB The extraction of information on terrestrial environments from satellite observations requires the use of quantitative models to interpret the radiation data collected in space. Several approaches are feasible, ranging from the development of models capable of explaining the nature of the measured physical signal or of characterizing the state of the system under observation, to the establishment of empirical correlations between the variables of interest and the remote measurements. The premises and implications of these approaches are discussed with special emphasis on the mathematical and numerical requirements. Findings are condensed in 10 formal propositions, in the hope of clarifying the nature and domain of applicability of remote sensing. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996.

AB Labeling, feature selection, and the choice of classifier are critical elements for classification of scenes and for image understanding. This study examines several methods for feature selection in polar regions, including the use of a fuzzy logic-based expert system for further refinement of a set of selected features. Six Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Local Area Coverage (LAC) arctic scenes are classified into nine classes: water, snow lice, ice cloud, land, thin stratus, stratus over water, cumulus over water, textured snow over water, and snow-covered mountains. Sixty-seven spectral and textural features are computed and analyzed by the feature selection algorithms. The divergence, histogram analysis, and discriminant analysis approaches are intercompared for their effectiveness in feature selection. The fuzzy expert system method is used not only to determine the effectiveness of each approach in classifying polar scenes, but also to further reduce the features into a more optimal set. For each selection method, features are ranked from best to worst, and the best half of the features are selected. Then, rules using these selected features are defined. The results of running the fuzzy expert system with these rules show that the divergence method produces the best set of features, not only does it produce the highest classification accuracy, but also it has the lowest computation requirements. A reduction of die set of features produced by the divergence method using the fuzzy expert system results in an overall classification accuracy of over 95 %. However, this increase of accuracy has a high computation cost.

AB Thermal infrared emissivity is un important parameter both for surface characterization and for atmospheric correction methods. Mapping the emissivity from satellite data is therefore a very important question to solve. The main problem is the coupling of the temperature and emissivity effects in the thermal radiances. Several methods have been developed to obtain surface emissivity from satellite data. In this way we propose a theoretical model that relates the emissivity to the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) of a given surface and explains the experimental behavior observed by van de Griend and Owe. We can use it to obtain the emissivity in any thermal channel, but in this work toe have focused on the 10.5- to 12.5-mu m region, where most thermal sensors on board satellites work at present. The model is applicable to areas with several soil and vegetation types and where the vegetation cover changes. From the theoretical model we have developed an operational methodology to obtain the effective emissivity combining satellite images and field measurements. The error of the methodology ranges from 0.5% (due to the experimental limitations of the field methods) to 2% (considering the case in which we have no information about the studied area). To check the general validity of the model, we have validated and applied it in different atmospheric environments and in areas with a different degree of roughness, i.e., from midlatitude (France, Argentina) to tropical (Sahel, Botswana) atmospheres, and from flat (La Mancha, Spain) to rough (Valencia, Spain) surfaces, and we have obtained an error of estimate of 0.6% on the emissivity.

AB This article deals with the representation of the canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) with a model that is simple, for inversion purposes, and computationally cheap. The objective was to derive the analytical expressions of radiative transfer in covers that may comprise strongly anisotropic vegetation layers and/or bottom interface. This is carried out through the introduction of an additional upward directional flux that originates from the anisotropic components of the cover, in a widely used and reliable three-flux model, that is, the SAIL (scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves) model. It results in a multi-layered four-flux model with a fast computer code. Parameters (i.e., r(sm) and r(dm)) that characterize the anisotropic behavior of canopy layers are computed with the same input parameters as the SAIL model. Moreover, at least one additional parameter is used for characterizing the anisotropic behavior of the bottom interface, that is, soil surface. Depending on the LAI (leaf angle index) and LAD (leaf angle distribution) of the upper layer and on the degree of anisotropy of the underlying layers, difference between BRFs that are derived from the four-flux model and from the SAIL model can be large. This stresses the necessity of the introduction of an upward directional flux in presence of covers with strongly anisotropic characteristics.

TI Methodology for estimating burned area from AVHRR reflectance data
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SAVANNA FIRES; IMAGES
AB Two methods are described to determine burned area from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. The first method, or the ''linear method,'' employs Channel 2 reflectance, R(2), and is based on the nearly linear relationship between the fraction of pixel burned, P, and R(2). The second method, or the ''nonlinear method,'' employs the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Channels 1 and 2 reflectances, and is based on the nonlinear relationship P=f(NDVI), a polynomial of order 2 in NDVI. The coefficients of the polynomial are parameterized as a function of the NDVI of the background before the fire event. Radiative transfer simulations indicate that the linear method, unlike the nonlinear method, must be applied to top-of-atmosphere reflectances that have been corrected for atmospheric influence. Sensitivity studies suggest that the methods are subject to some limitations. To avoid discontinuity problems, the original background (just before the fire) must be characterized by a Channel 2 reflectance above 0.07 and by a positive NDVI. To separate the useful signal from atmospheric effects, the fire scar must occupy at least 20% and 12% of the pixel area in the case of savanna and green vegetation (e.g., forest), respectively When applied to uniform pixels, the mean relative error on the fraction of area burned is about 20% for the linear method and 10% for the nonlinear method. The linear method gives better results for nonuniform pixels, but neither method can be used when the pixel contains low reflectance backgrounds (e.g., water).

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB A prototype least cost analysis was performed for pipeline routing using remotely sensed data and GIS analysis. A snail section of the proposed Caspian oil pipeline was chosen for development of the prototype. The entire proposed 700-km Caspian pipeline would connect with existing pipelines and carry oil from the Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan, on the Caspian Sea, to Novorossiysk in Russia, on the Black Sea. A model was developed incorporating pipeline length, topography, geology, land use, and stream, wetland, road, and railroad crossings to identify a least cost pathway. Satellite remote sensing imagery was used as a base to display results and to define the land cover. Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis was used for spatial modeling and data overlay. Costs associated with terrain conditions, geology, and land use were calculated from actual costs on a recent Bechtel pipeline project. The length and cost associated with a straight line path between four predetermined points along a section of the pipeline were compared with the length and cost of the least cost pathway. The straight line path was 42 km long, and the least cost pathway was 51 km long. Although longer in length, the least cost pathway (in the area considered) is 14% less expensive to construct than the straight line path. The least cost pathway realizes savings principally by avoiding higher cost urban and industrial cells on the straight line route. The results of this analysis demonstrate the benefits of integrating remotely sensed data with GIS analysis as a first look for pipeline routing.

AB In recent years, there have been many land-surface studies based on visible and near-infrared reflectance values retrieved from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and SPOT High Resolution. Visible (HRV) sensors. Retrieval of reflectance from. satellite sensor digital count requires knowledge of the atmospheric conditions and the sensor absolute calibration. In most cases, atmospheric conditions are simulated with a radiative transfer code and sensor calibration coefficients are obtained from preflight sensor calibrations or in-flight calibrations over bright surfaces (such as White Sands, New Mexico, USA, or La Crau, France). Though these procedures are well accepted, there have been few studies specifically designed to validate the accuracy of such reflectance factor retrievals (RFR) for both bright and dark targets. Data from two experiments conducted in an agricultural region in central Arizona were analyzed to quantify the accuracy of RFR from the Landsat TM and SPOT HRV sensors. These data included measurements made with groundbased and aircraft-based four-band radiometers and the NASA Advanced Solid-State Array Spectrometer (ASAS) aboard a C130 aircraft, and TM and HRV images acquired at nadir and off-nadir viewing angles. Results showed that the off-nadir reflectance factors measured using ground- and aircraft-based instruments, including ASAS, were comparable. The RFR from the satellite-based TM and HRV sensors generally resulted in an overestimation of dark target reflectance (up to 0.05 reflectance in the visible) and an underestimation of bright target reflectance (up to 0.1 reflectance in the near-infrared). Even greater error was possible when RFR was based on outdated sensor calibrations, particularly those conducted prelaunch. There was supporting evidence from studies at three sites (White Sands, New Mexico; Maricopa, Arizona; and Walnut Gulch, Arizona) that the Landsat-5 TM sensor sensitivity may have degraded by as much as 20% from the prelaunch calibration. Regarding the potential error in RFR related to recent changes in the processing of Landsat TM data (Level-0 and Level-1) by EOSAT Corporation, we found that the Level-0 data was slightly greater (similar to 2 digital counts) than the Level-1 data for all bands and all targets in our study.

AB The biophysical basis of the utility of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data to estimate coniferous timber volume was assessed for a mountainous, mixed-conifer species site in southeast British Columbia. Classification of forest inventory polygons with TM data was found to be 78% accurate to within 25% of the inventory volume for stand volumes between 150 m(3) ha(-1) and 300 m(3) ha(-1), compared to an accuracy of 44% for polygons with stand volumes less than 150 m(3) ha(-1). In polygons with timber volumes less than 150 m(3) ha(-1), variations in stand density and background reflectance, identified from MEIS-3 meter imagery, impeded volume classification from TM data. Forest ground call samples and corresponding terrain data, derived from a digital terrain model, were classified according to spatially homogeneous TM data, and the resulting classes were used to analyze the sensitivity of TM data to stand characteristics. From correlation and analysis of variance of classes, TM Bands 4 and 5 were found to be strongly inversely related to stand timber volume (P = 0.01) with TM Band 5 having the greatest dynamic range. Timber volume was strongly related to the bulk reflectance characteristics of the stand including stand height, age, species composition, slope, and aspect, and could thus be estimated from the remote sensing data. A geometric-optical reflectance simulation was used to estimate the relative contributions of forest cover and terrain to stand reflectance. The effects of terrain on the relationship between TM data and volume were small relative to the effects of forest cover. The radiometric basis of these relationships was discussed in relation to simulations of stand reflectance. For stand volumes of less than 400 m(3) ha(-1), simulated stand reflectance in both TM Bands 4 and 5 was sensitive to the proportions of shadow and exposed background in the stand, but had little sensitivity at volumes greater than 400 m(3) ha(-1) TM data may be used to estimate timber volume in other sites that possess similar characteristics to the site assessed here.

AB HAPEX Sahel (Hydrologic Atmospheric Pilot Experiment in the Sahel) was an international program focused on the soil-plant-atmosphere energy, water and carbon balance in the west African Sahel. It was intended to improve our understanding of the interaction between the Sahel and the general atmospheric circulation, both at present and in the future, providing a base line for studies of climate change. It was carried out in a 1 degrees X 1 degrees area of west Niger over a 3-4 year period with an 8-week intensive observation period from August to October 1992. HAPEX-Sahel was funded by a wide range of agencies in seven participating countries. Over 170 scientists visited and worked in the field. An interdisciplinary approach was adopted with contributed studies in hydrology and soil moisture surface fluxes and vegetation, remote sensing science, and meteorology and mesoscale modeling Detailed field measurements were concentrated at 3 ''supersites'' and 3 ancillary sites. Four aircraft were used for remote sensing and flux measurement. Observations from space were acquired from nine sensors on seven different satellite platforms. Conditions in 1992 turned out to be average far the last decade with good gradients of precipitation and a variety of vegetation productivities between the study sites. An information system has been established to provide a data base to disseminate the measurements. An active program of meetings, workshops, and interdisciplinary studies is now in progress.

AB The diversity of rangeland ecosystems makes application of remote sensing data difficult. This study was conducted to determine the effects of plant surface residue on rangeland canopy radiometric measurements. Measurements were made on moderately and heavily grazed native rangeland pastures. Standing senesced plant residue was collected and spread in the autumn to establish treatments of 0%, 33%, 66%, and 100% ground cover. Canopy radiometric measurements were made weekly the following grazing season using the red (RED) (0.63-0.69 mu m) and near infrared (NIR) (0.76-0.90 mu m) wavebands of a Mark II radiometer. We examined relationships between wavebands, ratio vegetation index (R = NIR / RED), the normalized difference vegetation index [ND = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED)] and forage dry matter accumulation and surface plant residue. All wavebands and indices were significantly related to dry matter accumulation on both moderately and heavily grazed pastures. Separation of residue treatments by radiometric measurements was more evident on moderately grazed than on heavily grazed pastures. Red reflectance was most sensitive to surface residue treatments and separated residue from no residue plots until early June when green growth became dominant. Vegetation indices R and ND tended to be lower for the 100% surface residue treatment for both pastures and higher for the 0% treatment for the moderately grazed pasture. Results suggest that different amounts of surface residue would not greatly interfere with using radiometric measurements to predict dry matter accumulation on Northern Great Plains native rangeland.

AB The crop water stress index (CWSI), developed at the USDA-ARS U.S. Water Conservation Laboratory, Phoenix, Arizona, is a commonly used index for detection of plant stress based on the difference between foliage and air temperature. Application of CWSI at local and regional scales has been hampered by the difficulty of measuring foliage temperature of partially vegetated fields. Most hand-held, airborne, and satellite-based infrared sensors measure a composite of both the soil and plant temperatures. The concept proposed here, termed the vegetation index/temperature (VIT) trapezoid, is an attempt to combine spectral vegetation indices with composite surface temperature measurements to allow application of the CWSI theory to partially-vegetated fields without knowledge of foliage temperature. Based on this approach, a new index [water deficit index (WDI)] was introduced for evaluating evapotranspiration rates of both full-cover and partially vegetated sites. By definition, WDI is related to the ratio of actual and potential evapotranspiration; in practice, WDI can be computed using remotely sensed measurements of surface temperature and reflectance (red and near-infrared spectrum) with limited on-site meteorological data (net radiation, vapor pressure deficit, windspeed, and air temperature). Both the VIT trapezoid and WDI concepts were evaluated using 1) a simulation of a two-component (soil and vegetation) energy balance model and 2) existing data from an experiment in an alfalfa field in Phoenix, Arizona. Results from both studies showed that the WDI provided accurate estimates of field evapotranspiration rates and relative field water deficit for both full-cover and partially vegetated sites.

TI REMOTE-SENSING AND THE MEASUREMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL ENTITIES IN A

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSIFICATION; RESOLUTION; IMAGES
AB The hypothesis tested in this study was that remote sensing constitutes a particular case of an arbitrary uniform spatial sampling grid used to obtain measurements about geographical entities that induces the scale and aggregation effect responsible for haphazard analysis results. The main objective was to evaluate the impact of measurement scale and spatial aggregation on the information content and classification accuracies of airborne MEIS-II data acquired over a midlatitude temperate forested environment. The original MEIS-II data were resampled to four spatial resolutions, namely 5 m, 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m. Forest classes were established according to three progressive levels of spatial aggregation. Descriptive statistics (Wald-Wolfowitz runs test, mean and variance) were calculated on transects of pixels representing each forest class delineated on the images at every spatial resolution. A maximum-likelihood classification was also performed for each combination of spatial resolution and aggregation level. The results reveal that, except for the mean, changing the measurement scale and the aggregation level of the classes greatly affects the values of the descriptive statistics. The Z value of the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test decreases with decreasing spatial resolution. The effect is more pronounced when the classes are progressively aggregated. For most classes, the variance decreases with the decrease of spatial resolution. In such cases, the impact of changing the measurement scale is greater than the change of aggregation level. Per-class accuracies are also considerably modified depending on the measurement scale and the aggregation level. Within a particular aggregation level, some classes are better classified at fine spatial resolutions, while others require coarser spatial resolutions. Three major conclusions can be stated from these results: 1) The information content of remote sensing images is dependent on the measurement scale determined by the spatial resolution of the sensor; 2) neglecting the scale and aggregation level when classifying remote sensing images can produce haphazard results having little correspondence with the objects of the scene; and 3) there is no unique spatial resolution appropriate for the detection and discrimination of all geographical entities composing a complex natural scene such as a forested environment. These conclusions provide a theoretical foundation from which original solutions to the problem of appropriate scales of measurement for geographical entities can be experimented. Logically, there exists an optimal spatial resolution for each entity of interest, corresponding to its intrinsic spatial and spectral characteristics.

ID AUTO-CORRELATION; DIGITAL IMAGES; CLOUD-COVER; REGULARIZATION; MODEL
AB In many remote sensing studies of geophysical fields such as clouds, land cover, or sea ice characteristics, the fractional area coverage of the field in an image is estimated as the proportion of pixels that have the characteristic of interest (i.e., are part of the field) as determined by some thresholding operation. The effect of sensor field-of-view on this estimate is examined by modeling the unknown distribution of subpixel area fraction with the beta distribution, whose two parameters depend upon the true fractional area coverage, the pixel size, and the spatial structure of the geophysical field. Since it is often not possible to relate digital number, reflectance, or temperature to subpixel area fraction, the statistical models described are used to determine the effect of pixel size and thresholding operations on the estimate of area fraction for hypothetical geophysical fields. Examples are given for simulated cumuliform clouds and linear openings in sea ice, whose spatial structures are described by an exponential autocovariance function. It is shown that the rate and direction of change in total area fraction with changing pixel size depends on the true area fraction, the spatial structure, and the thresholding operation used.

TI AGE-DEPENDENCE OF FOREST REFLECTANCE - ANALYSIS OF MAIN DRIVING FACTORS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB As an analogy to forest yield tables, successional trajectories of forest reflectance can be established. Examples of such deterministic reflectance age trajectories for common northern temperate forest types in Estonia have been derived from airborne reflectance measurements and simulated by a forest reflectance model. In the simulations, the yield tables were used as input data. The primary controls on the reflectance age course are changes in canopy closure, tree-storey leaf-area index, species composition, and background reflectance. In long-term monitoring of forest stands, the effects of sun and view angle and phenology must be considered. Successional reflectance trajectories may further form a basis for a forest inventory and monitoring system. Provided that the problems of normalization of multidate satellite imageries and seasonal signature variation are solved, the reflectance change of a particular forest stand may be compared to the change predicted by established reflectance successional trajectories. In case of normal forest development, the measured reflectance changes must be close to those predicted. Some kinds of the disturbance-type forest changes (e.g., extensive thinning due to damage) are detectable by optical methods.

DT Article
ID SATELLITE DATA
AB This research relates the results Of a survey and detailed analysis of soils in a northern mixed conifer forest to vegetation characteristics as represented by remotely sensed data. The work was conducted at International Paper's Northern Experimental Forest (NEF) at Howland, Maine as part of NASA's Forest Ecosystem Dynamics (FED) project. An intensive soil survey was performed and relationships between soil properties (i.e., drainage class, depth of active zone, water holding capacity, carbon/nitrogen ratio, pH, and sum of bases), species composition, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Advanced Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) were derived. Results showed that there was great variability in soil properties across the landscape due to complex regional glacial activity and recent alluvial events. Significant statistical differences were observed in species composition and NDVI between soil mapping units and with soil drainage class. However, other specific soil properties could not be used to explain these differences given the number of soil samples characterized, or without taking disturbance and management history into account. Simulation modeling, which would include soil data and stand history information as inputs, would provide an additional means of interpreting the relationship between remotely sensed imagery, inferred ecosystem properties, and complex, landscape-level patterns of soil characteristics.

TI SOIL BACKGROUND EFFECTS ON REFLECTANCE-BASED CROP COEFFICIENTS FOR CORN

LA English
DT Article
ID VEGETATION INDEXES; LEAF-AREA; CANOPY; CALIBRATION; PANELS
AB A previously developed reflectance-based crop coefficient (K(cr)) for corn, estimated from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), has been shown to overestimate the basal crop coefficient (K(cb)) for corn by 24 % or more when used with a dark-colored soil. This overestimation occurs because the NDVI produces larger index values for the same vegetation amount over dark backgrounds. Thus, the purpose of this article was to investigate newer vegetation indices that have been developed to minimize soil background effects and to develop a reflectance-based crop coefficient for corn that applies over a wide range of agricultural soil reflectance. Two soils (light- and dark-colored) with red reflectance of 31 % and 13 %, respectively, were selected for this study. Reflectance data of the corn canopy were acquired with four combinations of these soils (light, dry; light, wet; dark, dry, and dark, wet) in trays inserted at the same place beneath the corn canopy. The soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), with an adjustment factor (L) set to 0. 5, was found to adequately minimize soil background influences from sparse to dense vegetation conditions. A linear transformation between the K(cb) for corn and the SAVI was used to convert the SAVI into the K(cr). The maximum difference for this K(cr) between the light, dry soil background and the dark, wet soil background (extreme cases) was less than 6 %. The K(cr) based on the SAVI corrects for a wet soil surface and requires no additional calibration to estimate the basal crop coefficient for corn grown on most agricultural soils.

TI FACTORS CAUSING VARIATION IN REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS FROM BRACKEN IN
   EASTERN AUSTRALIA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID FIELD
AB Bracken covers large areas of cleared land in eastern Australia and is a costly problem in the management of these lands. Field reflectance measurements of patches of bracken are statistically different from those of other vegetation frequently associated with bracken in eastern Australia. There is, however, a lot of variation in reflectance measurements for any vegetation type, and some patches of vegetation may be misidentified on the basis of their reflectance characteristics. This paper examines variation in reflectance associated with shadowing, zenith angle, and percent cover of bracken. Up to 70 % of the variation in ground-based measurements of reflectance from bracken and associated vegetation was accounted for by variation in shadowing and zenith angle. Variation in amount of shadowing is partially related to the age of bracken fronds, probably because the structure of the bracken canopy changes as fronds senesce. For patches of bracken mixed with other vegetation, there were gradual changes in reflectance correlated with change in amount Of bracken cover. Therefore, it may be possible to estimate the percent bracken cover in a stand based on reflectance measurements, rather than simply classifying stands as ''bracken'' or ''nonbracken.'' Such estimates of percent cover may be particularly useful in Australia, where bracken often occurs mixed with other vegetation types rather than in large homogeneous stands. These results are encouraging for the prospect of using remote sensing to look at spread of bracken and lor to estimate biomass for stands of particular frond ages. Correlations between reflectance and proportion of dead bracken and between amount of bracken and reflectance are potentially useful for examining short- and long-term effects of herbicide treatments or other management strategies on large bracken stands.

SPOT images were acquired on 21 July 1986 and 1 July 1989. Differences between the two dates in snow and ice cover and morphology of the crater allowed us to foresee an increase in activity and possible change in the eruptive process. After the beginning of the eruptive stage, five SPOT images were provided by the CNES (France), the last one dated 12 December 1990. They show variations Of ash cover, the opening of fractures, an increase of the crater size, and new mudflows. The 10-m ground resolution and stereoscopic capabilities of Panchromatic SPOT imagery permitted us follow the major changes of geomorphic features during a volcanic eruptive stage.

TI CHARACTERIZATION OF SEMIVEGETATED SALT-AFFECTED SOILS BY MEANS OF FIELD

DT Article
AB Many recent attempts to map soils and related ecological phenomena are concerned with spatial patterns.  There is a large diversity of approaches to determine 1) the actual parameters to be measured, 2) the most informative categories to be formed based on them, and depending on both of the above, 3) the sampling locations and 4) the resolution of the map.  This paper reports a field remote sensing project to meet the requirements of a detailed botanical and soils survey to understand salinity status of the Hortobagy region in east Hungary.  The problem of association-level recognition of land cover is addressed in terms of quantitative description and ground resolution.  It is concluded that the most characteristic six to seven vegetation association types are well identifiable based on their TM spectra using discriminant analysis / nonhierarchical clustering with half-meter ground resolution.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB The effects of background reflectance, leaf size, and leaf height above the background on upward and downward radiant flux (phi-u and phi-d) from a leaf were investigated using a computer model of a horizontal, isotropically scattering leaf.  This research was conducted to determine how these variables influence the light environment above, below and adjacent to a leaf.  Leaf spectral properties for big-leaf maple (Acer macrophyllum) were measured in the laboratory and used in the model.  Model results were reported as relative radiant flux (phi-r), defined as a percentage of the light entered into the model.  The model showed that upward relative radiant flux phi-ur from a leaf was highly dependent on the reflectance of the background and the wavelength of light.  The greatest variation in phi-ur was observed in the near infrared (NIR).  The phi-ur also varied depending upon the height of the leaf above the background and the size of the leaf.  Leaves were brightest when placed the farthest distance above the background.  Small leaves reached maximum brightness at lower heights than larger leaves.  Finally, phi-ur varied spatially.  Leaf edges reflected more light than the leaf center except for leaves positioned very close to the background.  Additional studies using the model showed that the intensity of light within a leaf shadow varied spatially, with the greatest downward relative radiant flux phi-dr, occurring directly below the center of the leaf.  Furthermore, phi-dr within the shadow cast by the leaf decreased as the height of the leaf above the background increased.  The rate of decrease depended upon the size of the leaf.  The smaller the leaf, the greater was the change in phi-dr with change in leaf height.  These results imply that NIR canopy reflectance, due to leaf transmittance, may be highly dependent upon the reflectance of its background.  Furthermore, architecturally different canopies may show different degrees of dependence upon background reflectance in the NIR.  These results extend to closed canopies, in which leaf size and spacing may vary the reflectance of the canopy.  Finally, these results suggest that the amount of light scattered to the side by leaves increases the amount of NIR light measured from adjacent, unshadowed backgrounds.

AB The drought monitoring indexes, such as SPEI and SPCI, have been proposed previously. However, these indexes are established at specific station and unsuitable to evaluate the regional drought, which becomes the focus of this study. A novel drought monitoring method using the zenith troposphere delay (ZTD) derived from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and precipitation is proposed, and a new index, which is named regional precipitation and ZTD index (RPZI), is established. The station-based precipitation and ZTD index (PZI) is first proposed by considering the data selection, expression, multi-time scale and standardization. The RPZI is then calculated by using the Thiessen Polygon method to determine the weighting of each station in the located area. The proposed PZI is first validated in 8 climatic regions of China over the period of 2006-2018 at 801 metrological stations. The RPZI is further evaluated in arid, semiarid, humid, and semi humid areas of China over the period of 2006-2018 and Townsville, Queensland in Australia over the period of 1998-2018, respectively. Comparison results show that the proposed RPZI has a good consistency with the regional precipitation smoothing index (RPSI) when compared with station-based SPEI, station-based PZI, and regional SPEI (RSPEI), and the correlation coefficient is the highest between the RPZI and RPSI with values of 0.81, 0.90, 0.93, and 0.85 in four areas of China, and the corresponding value reaches 0.964 in Queensland, Australia. Such results show the good capacity of the proposed RPZI for regional drought monitoring, which is of great importance for global drought disaster prevention.

AB Variations in the concentrations and distribution of suspended particulate matter (SPM) of lakes can be used to show the responses of lake environment to climate and landscape change. However, the shifts and trends of SPM and potential drivers have not been well investigated across large spatial and temporal dimensions. This study developed a robust machine learning model to generate SPM time series in 269 lakes across China larger than 30 km2 from 2002 to 2021 using MODIS/Aqua imagery. The support vector regression model showed satisfactory performance on SPM retrievals over four orders of magnitude (0.1-1000 mg L-1) (mean absolute percentage error = 26%). The model performance was shown to be insensitive to changes in environmental and observing conditions (e.g., aerosol type and thickness, viewing geometry), based on a radiative transfer simulation model. The long-term MODIS record showed a spatial pattern of lower SPM in the western lakes compared to the shallow lakes of east China. Importantly, the SPM showed a significant decrease in the 21st century (average rate of change of-0.2 mg L-1/decade). The interannual variations in SPM were aggregated into five categories, ranging from lakes with continuous changing patterns to those with reversed changing patterns. The driving factors behind the changing patterns vary between different climate zones and ecoregions. A warmer and wetter climate was associated with decreasing SPM in western lakes, while the decrease in wind speed and reduced possibility of soil erosion were the primary drivers of progressively lower SPM in the eastern shallow lakes. These results not only show a comprehensive picture of the SPM dynamics of lakes in China but also provide new insights into the complex mechanisms that drive SPM spatiotemporal dynamics.

AB Thermal discharge from nuclear power plants poses a threat to the received natural water bodies, but the long-term extent and intensity of their surface thermal plumes remain unclear. In this study, we proposed a method to determine the background area for each drainage outlet and delineate the mixed surface thermal plumes based on 7,172 Landsat thermal infrared images. We further used a deep convolutional neural network integrated with prior location knowledge to extract core surface thermal plumes for 74 drainage outlets of 66 nuclear power plants worldwide. Our final model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8998 and an F1 score of 0.8886. We found that the mean maximal water surface temperature (WST) increment of the studied plants globally was 4.80 K. The Tianwan plant in China experienced the highest WST increase (8.51 K), followed by the Gravelines plant in France and the Ohi plant in Japan (7.91 K and 7.71 K, respectively). The Bruce plant in Canada had the largest thermal-polluted surface area (7.22 km2). We also provided the dataset, Global Coastal Nuclear power plant Thermal Plume (GCNT-Plume), to describe the long-term occurrence of water surface thermal plumes. Three influencing factors of the water surface thermal plume were further analyzed in this study, including total capacity, drainage type, and location type, which were associated with operating power, drainage method, and geographical features, respectively. Total capacity was more statistically related to the maximum of WST increment under shallow drainage condition. The mean WST increment of shallow drainage was 1.22 K higher than that of deep drainage. Surface plumes larger than 4 km2 frequently occurred in the Great Lakes, while small surface thermal plumes (< 1 km2) were primarily found in estuaries. The proposed method provides an important framework for future operational water surface thermal plume detection using remotely sensed observations and deep learning.

AB Since biodiversity often increases ecosystem functioning, changes in tree species diversity could substantially influence terrestrial carbon cycling. Yet much less is known about the relationships between forest structural diversity (i.e., the number and physical arrangement of vegetation elements in a forest) and carbon cycling, and the factors that mediate these relationships. We capitalize on spaceborne lidar data from NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and on-the-ground forest inventory and analysis (FIA) data from 1796 plots across the contiguous United States to assess relationships among the structural and species diversity of live trees and aboveground carbon storage. We found that carbon storage was more strongly correlated with structural diversity than with species diversity, for both forest inventory-based metrics of structural diversity (e.g., height and DBH diversity) and GEDI-based canopy metrics (i.e., foliage height diversity (FHD)). However, the strength of diversity-carbon storage relationships was mediated by forest origin and forest types. For both plotbased and GEDI-based metrics, the relationship between structural diversity (i.e., height diversity, DBH diversity, and FHD) and carbon storage was positive in natural forests for all forest types (broadleaf, mixed, conifer). For planted forests, structural diversity showed positive relationships in planted conifer forests but not in planted mixed forests. Species diversity did not show strong associations with carbon storage in natural forests but showed a positive relationship in mixed coniferous-broadleaf planted forests. Although plot-based structural diversity metrics refine our understanding of drivers of forest carbon balances at the plot scale, remotely sensed metrics such as those from GEDI can help extend that understanding to regional/national scales in a spatially continuous manner. Carbon storage showed stronger associations with plot-based structural diversity than with stand age, soil variables, or climate variables. Incorporating structural diversity into management and restoration strategies could help guide efforts to increase carbon storage and mitigate climate change as nature-based solutions.

AB The rapid growth of the city of Sydney, Australia over the last decades, has led to significant development of residential and transportation infrastructure. Land subsidence associated with the urban development can lead to serious issues which should be thoroughly understood and carefully managed. To address this challenge, an enhanced polarisation time-series InSAR (Pol-TS-InSAR) processing framework was developed, using the dual polarisation (DP) Sentinel-1 data to integrate information from different polarimetric channels with different weighting during the TS-InSAR deformation analysis. Ninety DP Sentinel-1 images acquired between 2019 and 2022 are analysed using Pol-TS-InSAR to map the land subsidence in Sydney, with the assistance of the GPS measurements. Improvement of measurement points density from Pol-TS-InSAR is observed compared to the single polarimetric TS-InSAR counterpart for all land use types (ranging between 68% and 208%). The com-parison between the Pol-TS-InSAR measurements and GPS measurements shows an absolute mean difference and RMS difference of 0.75 mm/yr and 0.95 mm/yr, respectively, in vertical direction. The results of the ground subsidence analysis revealed that the main subsidence factors in Sydney are related to groundwater extraction, mining activities, underground tunnel construction and landfill. The latter two factors were less well-known prior to this study. In additional to these factors, land subsidence related to high-rise building construction has also been observed, even though the impact seems to be less significant than other factors.

AB Understory plant communities are an integral component of deciduous forests, playing a vital role in the overall health of the ecosystem. However, remote sensing of understory plant communities is challenging due to the obstruction by the forest canopy. In this study, we proposed an automated dense Sentinel-2 time series-based approach for understory plant communities and created maps of four understory classes (i.e., native shrubs of greenbrier and mountain laurel, and invasive shrubs of barberry and the assemblage of mixed invasive) at 10 m resolution in Connecticut's deciduous forests in 2020. A harmonic time series model and three years of Sentinel-2 time series from 2019 to 2021 were used to classify understory species based on their unique, intra-annual phenology characteristics. The time series model coefficients captured the subtle phenology differences and created synthetic cloud-free images within a short temporal window in the spring prior to canopy leaf-on (hereafter called "observation window"). During the observation window, Sentinel-2 data penetrated the deciduous overstory canopy and observed the unique trajectories of different understory species due to their phenology differences. We also calculated spatial texture features (i.e., mean, second moment, and contrast from gray level co-occurrence matrix) based on the synthetic images created within the observation window to capture the different conditions of leaf growth and distinct spatial patterns within deciduous forests. By using the spectral, temporal, and spatial features as input variables from dense Sentinel-2 data, auxiliary data (i.e., LiDAR and soil drainage layer), a random forest classifier, and a new strategy to iteratively select representative sample (namely ISRS), understory species maps were created with an overall accuracy of approximately 93%, and the user's and producer's accuracies varied from 39% to 99% for the three mapped understory species and one assemblage of species. The proposed method created an accurate binary map of understory presence with an overall accuracy of 95%, a producer's accuracy of 84%, and a user's accuracy of 68%. Additionally, we separated the invasive (i.e. barberry and mixed invasive of multi-flora rose, oriental bittersweet, honeysuckle, winged euonymus, and autumn olive) and native (greenbrier and mountain laurel) species with an overall accuracy of 94%. We estimated that the invasive species cover an area of 649.33 +/- 140.59 km(2), which occupied a large proportion (similar to 53%) of the shrub understory in Connecticut's deciduous forests.

ID GULLY EROSION; SEDIMENT; IMPACTS; MANAGEMENT
AB Increased erosion related to climate and/or land cover change has adverse impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Mapping of erosion hotspots improves our ability to identify and potentially remediate the most active erosion sources. The topical savannas of the Great Barrier Reef catchments, in northeast Australia, are generating excessive sediment yields, primarily from gully erosion. To reduce the adverse impacts on marine ecosystems, there is an urgent need to identify priority erosion hotspots and implement mitigation measures. While repeat airborne LiDAR surveys allow subtle topographic change detection, they are cost-intensive for catchment-scale applications and their applicability is constrained by data avalability and detection treshold of ground level change. In contrast, satellite-based radar imagery can allow large scale tracking of geomorphic change at high temporal resolution. Here we apply a new method based on Sentinel-1 C-band radar images and Coherence Change Detection (CCD), where large stacks of interferometric coherence images are subdivided with rain gauge time-series for separation of erosion-rich and erosion-free coherence information. After correcting the former with the latter, the resulting corrected coherence maps are compared with differential elevation models derived from multitemporal LiDAR, regional scale gully delineation maps, maps of gullying potential and in-situ field verification. Our results demonstrate the promising potential of this technique in detecting gully erosion hotspots. The coherence loss indicating erosion/deposition is well detected in wide gully morphologies, however, the line-of-sight angle does not allow penetration into narrow linear gullies. Further, CCD detects sheetwash or rill erosion occurring in areas identified as at risk of gully expansion, which is commonly below detection threshold for multitemporal LiDAR datasets. When used with LiDAR-derived geomorphic change mapping and gullying potential maps, CCD allows identification of gully erosion dynamics and forecasting gully evolution and creation, which is critical for supporting mitigation measures.

AB Spatially continuous mapping forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is crucial for better understanding the ca-pacities of carbon sequestration capacities of forest ecosystems at both individual tree and landscape levels. Collecting field data is one of the most labor-intensive and time-consuming tasks in biomass mapping using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Building on a LiDAR biomass index (LBI) developed for use with terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data, we successfully developed an improved and robust LBI-based approach to estimate forest AGB at both individual tree and plot levels while minimizing the effort required for field data collection. This approach was tested for larch, birch, and eucalyptus over three forest farms in Northeast China and one in Southern China. The results showed that LBI was highly correlated with the diameter, height, and AGB of larch trees. AGB estimates derived using LBI-based models for the three tree species were close to ground measure-ments at the individual tree level. They explained 81% to 95% of the variance of independent test data not used to calibrate those models. Tree level AGB estimates are required by many applications, but they could not be provided by commonly used plot-based biomass mapping approaches like LiDAR metrics-based regression (LMR) or Random Forest (RF). Calibrated with small fractions of the trees needed to calibrate LMR and RF models, LBI-based biomass models produced plot level biomass estimates comparable to or better than those produced using the two plot-based methods. More importantly, the LBI-based models generalized far better than LMR and RF among the three larch forest farms located hundreds of kilometers apart. These promising results warrant more research on the effectiveness of the LBI-based approach for other forest types and tree species not considered in this study. As LiDAR technology and related algorithms are evolving rapidly, further improvements to this approach might be feasible. A robust LBI-based approach applicable to a wide range of tree species and forest types across the globe will greatly facilitate the use of increasingly better and more affordable ALS data to support REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) and other forest-based climate mitigation initiatives.

AB Despite the popularity and success in burned area detection and assessment, multispectral satellite images are often affected by poor sunlight-illumination conditions, particularly at high latitudes. Given that Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can effectively penetrate clouds and collect images in all-weather conditions during day and night, the complementary use of optical and SAR data can be helpful for remote-sensing measurements and assessments of burned sites. Nevertheless, the widely used burn-sensitive spectral indices hardly help analyze SAR data due to the inherent difference between optical and SAR sensors in physical imaging mechanisms. In this study, we aim to leverage multi-source data for burned area mapping and burn severity assessment by translating SAR images into optical images using ResNet-based Pix2Pix model. Experiments were performed on 8669 pairs of bitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical patches over 304 large wildfire events in Canada with a wide range of land covers. The translated optical images from SAR data occupied similar spectral properties to real optical observations and the corresponding generated spectral indices (i.e., delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), relative dNBR, and Relativized Burn Ratio) also showed high agreement with real optical indices. In terms of burned area detection using the generated indices, their medium values of the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) were over 85%, achieving promising performance that outperformed the SAR-based index. Burn severity maps derived from multi-source data achieved a relatively high Kappa coefficient of 0.77. Results showed the feasibility and effectiveness of GAN-based SAR-to-optical translation for wildfire impact assessment, paving the way for the combined use of optical and SAR data.

AB Detecting disease- or insect-infested forests as early as possible is a classic application of remote sensing. Under conditions of climate change and global warming, outbreaks of the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus, L.) are threatening spruce forests and the related timber industry across Europe, and early detection of infestations is important for damage control. Infested trees without visible discoloration (green attack) have been identified using multispectral images, but how early green attacks can be detected is still unknown. This study aimed to determine when infested trees start to show an abnormal spectral response compared with healthy trees, and to quantify the detectability of infested trees during the infestation process. Pheromone bags were used to attract bark beetles in a controlled experiment, and subsequent infestations were assessed in the field on a weekly basis. In total, 977 trees were monitored, including 208 attacked trees. Multispectral drone images were obtained before and during the insect attacks, representing different periods of infestation. Individual tree crowns (ITC) were delineated by marker-controlled watershed segmentation, and the average reflectance of ITCs was analyzed based on the duration of infestation. The detectability of green attacks and driving factors were examined. We propose new Multiple Ratio Disease-Water Stress Indices (MR-DSWIs) as vegetation indices (VI) for detecting infestations. We defined a VI range of 5-95% as a healthy tree, and a VI value outside that range as an infested tree. Detection rates using multispectral images were always higher than discoloration rates observed in the field, and the newly proposed MR-DSWIs detected more infested trees than the established VIs. Infestations were detectable at 5 and 10 weeks after an attack at a rate of 15% and 90%, respectively, from the multispectral drone images. Weeks 5-10 of infestation therefore represent a suitable period for using the proposed methodology to map infestation at an early stage.

AB The aim of Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) is to supply reliable climate data in support of strategies to adaptation and mitigation to climate change. The C3S provides access to high-quality climate data through its Climate Data Records (CDRs) of atmospheric, marine and land Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). Global Earth Surface Albedo (SA) satellite-based products are included in the land (biosphere) portfolio. SA is a magnitude which quantifies the fraction of solar energy reflected by the surface of the Earth. This paper details the retrieval methodology and preliminary validation results for global estimates of surface albedo based on Sentinel-3 observations for the C3S ECVs data (C3S SA v3.0). The retrieval algorithm exploits the synergistic use of the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) on-board Sentinel-3 A and B satellites. Firstly, the atmospherically corrected reflectances are generated in the Copernicus Global Land Service framework. After that, the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) inversion module concludes the BRDF model parameters, which are transferred to the angular integration module in order to generate spectral albedo quantities for the selected OLCI (Oa03, Oa04, Oa07, Oa17 and Oa21) and SLSTR (S1, S2, S5 and S6) bands. At the end, the spectral integration module generates broadband albedo quantities in three different standard broadband spectral regions (visible [0.4 mu m - 0.7 mu m ], near infrared [0.7 mu m - 4 mu m] and total shortwave [0.3 mu m - 4 mu m]). Preliminary validation results over 10-months demonstration period (July 2018-April 2019) show, in terms of spatial and temporal consistency, that C3S Sentinel-3 SA global estimates reached in general good agreement as compared to other satellite operational references derived from MODIS (MCD43A3 C6) and PROBA-V (C3S PROBA-V SA v1.0) acquisitions. The comparison with ground data shows similar results to the MCD43A3 C6 comparisons but opposite sign in differences (marginally positive in case of Sentinel-3), with accuracy of 0.005 (3.7%), precision of 0.016 (11.3%) and uncertainty of 0.032 (22.7%). Our results have demonstrated the feasibility to estimate global fields of SA from Sentinel-3 observations, with similar quality of existing operational products. These Sentinel-3 based SA datasets will give the continuity to the existing C3S SA CDR, introducing improvements in terms of spatial resolution (300 m) and spectral information (9 spectral albedos) in contrast to previous datasets based on Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR; 4 km, 4 channels) and Vegetation instruments (VGT; 1 km, 4 channels).

AB Wildfire disturbances can profoundly impact many aspects of both ecosystem functioning and resilience. This study proposes a satellite-based approach to assess ecosystem resilience to wildfires based on post-fire trajec-tories of four key functional dimensions of ecosystems related to carbon, water, and energy exchanges: (i) vegetation primary production; (ii) vegetation and soil water content; (iii) land surface albedo; and (iv) land surface sensible heat. For each dimension, several metrics extracted from satellite image time-series, at the short, medium and long-term, describe both resistance (the ability to withstand environmental disturbances) and re-covery (the ability to pull back towards equilibrium). We used MODIS data for 2000-2018 to analyze trajectories after the 2005 wildfires in NW Iberian Peninsula. Primary production exhibited low resistance, with abrupt breaks immediately after the fire, but rapid recoveries, starting within six months after the fire and reaching stable pre-fire levels two years after. Loss of water content after the fire showed slightly higher resistance but slower and more gradual recoveries than primary production. On the other hand, albedo exhibited varying levels of resistance and recovery, with post-fire breaks often followed by increases to levels above pre-fire within the first two years, but sometimes with effects that persisted for many years. Finally, wildfire effects on sensible heat were generally more transient, with effects starting to dissipate after one year and overall rapid recoveries. Our approach was able to successfully depict key features of post-fire processes of ecosystem functioning at different timeframes. The added value of our multi-indicator approach for analyzing ecosystem resilience to wildfires was highlighted by the independence and complementarity among the proposed indicators targeting four dimensions of ecosystem functioning. We argue that such approaches can provide an enhanced characterization of ecosystem resilience to disturbances, ultimately upholding promising implications for post-fire ecosystem management and targeting different dimensions of ecosystem functioning.

AB Characterizing drought is mandatory for a thorough monitoring of crop growth. Such information can be inferred from radiometric measurements in optical and thermal spectral ranges. The Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) presents the advantage to mix spectral information since it associates land surface temperature (LST) with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). NDVI is known to be weakly impact by directional effects, which is not the case of TVDI as the accuracy assessment of LST can be severely hampered directional anisotropy (DA). In this paper, DA feature of TVDI is analyzed using the kernel-driven model Vinnikov-Li (VinLi) that serves to perform through simulations and remove DA. The study uses both airborne and satellite datasets. TVDI was found to be angularly dependent, with a possible uncertainty larger than 15%. Compared against TVDI without angular correction, the normalized results displayed a better correlation with soil moisture content, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) of estimated soil moisture content decreased obviously, from 0.050 m3/m3 to 0.045 m3/m3 for airborne data over maize canopies, from approximately 0.036 m3/m3 to 0.030 m3/m3 for satellite data over cropland canopies, and from approximately 0.032 m3/m3 to 0.028 m3/m3 for satellite data over grassland canopies. The evaluation was carried out using the complied synthetic datasets based on the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model. These also confirmed the occurrence of significant DAs of TVDIs and good performance of VinLi in reducing DA of TVDI by >50%. Based on the VinLi method, an angular-independent TVDI appears necessary to reduce uncertainties originated from illuminating and viewing geometries for the purpose of agriculture monitoring with possible drought episodes. Although further evaluation is still needed using surface measurements, the outcomes support a confident use of TVDI for observations from satellite and airborne/unmanned aerial vehicle.

AB The diurnal sampling capability of geostationary satellites provides unprecedented opportunities for monitoring canopy photosynthesis at multiple temporal scales. At the diurnal scale, only geostationary satellites can currently provide sub-daily data at regular intervals, also it can help to minimize data gaps due to clouds at the seasonal scale. However, the potential of geostationary satellites for monitoring photosynthesis has not been explored in depth. In this study, we tracked diurnal to seasonal variations in gross primary production (GPP) using the product of near-infrared reflectance of vegetation and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (NIRvP) over deciduous forests, mixed forests and a rice paddy during the growing season. For this purpose, we generated three levels of reflectance and PAR from Geostationary Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2A (GK-2A). We examined how NIRvP derived from GK-2A tracked in-situ GPP data collected from five flux tower sites in South Korea. Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) normalized NIRvP agreed well with in-situ GPP over the course of the growing season at hourly (R-2 = 0.68-0.77) and daily timesteps (R-2 = 0.71-0.83). Atmospheric correction and BRDF normalization improved the performance of NIRvP in tracking GPP at both the diurnal and seasonal time scales. Also, GK-2A showed a much higher percentage of available high-quality BRDF data over the whole growing season for all study sites than the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (GK-2A: 85%; MODIS: 39%), especially during the cloudy monsoon period. Our findings demonstrated that the unique observation characteristics of geostationary satellites can contribute to large-scale monitoring of diurnal to seasonal GPP dynamics.

AB We proposed a new image compositing algorithm (MAX-RNB) based on the maximum ratio of Near Infrared (NIR) to Blue band (RNB), and evaluated it together with nine other compositing algorithms: MAX-NDVI (maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), MED-NIR (median NIR band), WELD (conterminous United States Web-Enabled Landsat Data), BAP (Best Available Pixel), PAC (Phenology Adaptive Composite), WPS (Weighted Parametric Scoring), MEDOID (medoid measurement), COSSIM (cosine similarity), and NLCD (National Land Cover Database). Each algorithm was applied to time series of Landsat observations collected within two separate years at six locations around the world, to produce monthly (July 1 +/- 15 days), seasonal (July 1 +/- 45 days), and annual (July 1 +/- 180 days) composite images free of cloud, cloud shadow, and snow/ice. By comparing the composite images to reference Landsat images acquired in the growing season (closest to July 1 within +/- 15 days) for each year, we evaluated the performance of the algorithms in preserving the spectral and spatial fidelity (hereafter referred to as spectral and spatial evaluation, respectively), as well as land cover classification and land change detection (hereafter referred to as application evaluation). The results demon-strated that no single algorithm outperformed all other algorithms in all the evaluations, but that performance depended on compositing intervals and cloud cover. For monthly composites, the MAX-RNB algorithm generally produced the best results in the spectral and application evaluations. For seasonal composites, the NLCD algo-rithm produced the best results in the spectral and application evaluations. For annual composites, the PAC algorithm produced the best results in the spectral evaluation and change detection, whereas BAP produced the best results in land cover classification. The BAP algorithm also produced the best results in the spatial evaluation for all the compositing periods. This study provides a comprehensive guidance for selecting the most appropriate image compositing algorithm for different Landsat-based applications.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important tool for achieving accurate and efficient monitoring of maritime traffic by identifying ships and wakes. Ship wake can not only assist in ship detection, but also invert ship navigation information, which has attracted wide attention. However, most of the work on ship wake detection is still through non-deep learning methods. Limited by factors such as unclear features, complex background interference and insufficient label information in large-scale SAR images, deep learning methods have developed slowly in the field of ship wake detection. In this paper, we propose a lightweight deep learning network for ship and wake detection. In the framework, a YOLO structure based deep learning is implemented to achieve ship and wake classification and localization. For this purpose, we initially create a Gaofen-3 SAR dataset containing about 1000 pairs of ships and wakes. To streamline the deep learning network, based on the background and pixel characteristics of SAR images, we design a combined convolutional module in combination with an attention mechanism, which replaces the convolutional layers in the backbone to extract more diverse feature maps at a low cost. In addition, in view of the geometric features of ship wake, the optimized design is conducted in the target prediction stage, and the angle-related loss function is developed to guide the training of the network, which not only ensures the detection of the ship target, but also greatly improves the accuracy of wake line detection. Experimental results show that the developed lightweight network achieves accurate and stable detection of ships and wakes in the dataset, and it has excellent generalization ability in complex background and weak target detection. The performance is comparable to the state-of-the-art models, where the average precision of ship and wake detection reaches 77.86% and 97.29%, respectively. Particularly, the average angle error between the predicted and actual values of wake lines is reduced by 3.476 degrees. Moreover, the low energy consumption (model size is one-sixth of YOLOv4) and real-time detection (>23.1 FPS) of the algorithm offer great potential for embedded deployment.

ID SEA-LEVEL RISE; FIELD
AB Land subsidence is an important cause of relative sea-level rise along the Gulf Coast. There is a lack of effective monitoring of coastal subsidence with high accuracy and high spatial resolution for improving coastal risk assessment and mitigation. This study is the first attempt to integrate satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) methods to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern of coastal subsidence. The study area is around Eagle Point, Texas, a region known for its fast rate of relative sea-level rise in recent decades. From 2006 to 2011, the line-of-sight velocities were up to-33 mm/year based on ascending ALOS-1 PALSAR-1 images. From 2016 to 2021, the vertical velocities were up to-34 mm/ year based on ascending and descending Sentinel-1 images. Additional details of the subsidence pattern were revealed by incorporating the surface difference derived from 1-m airborne LiDAR results. Comparisons of the InSAR-derived velocities from image time series and the LiDAR-derived surface changes from time-lapsed ob-servations were conducted at different spatial levels with linkages to land cover patterns and topography. The results showed that local subsidence rates could vary significantly below the spatial resolution of InSAR results, indicating a valuable role of airborne LiDAR results in extending InSAR results to parcel and building levels and explaining subpixel uncertainties. Also, subsidence appeared to be stronger in vegetated areas than in developed areas and negatively correlated with surface imperviousness. The magnitude of subsidence was not correlated with elevation along selected transect lines. Overall, this study demonstrated the benefits of combining InSAR results with other geospatial datasets to characterize coastal subsidence. In particular, the high vertical accuracy of InSAR results and the high spatial resolution of airborne LiDAR results could be complementary, highlighting the necessity of multi-resolution data fusion to support studies on coastal flood vulnerability, infrastructure reliability, and erosion control.

AB Remote sensing of the Earth's surface water is critical in a wide range of environmental studies, from evaluating the societal impacts of seasonal droughts and floods to the large-scale implications of climate change. Consequently, a large literature exists on the classification of water from satellite imagery. Yet, previous methods have been limited by (1) the > 10 m spatial resolution of public satellite imagery, (2) classification schemes that operate at the pixel level, and (3) the need for multiple spectral bands. We advance the state-of-the-art by (1) using commercial satellite imagery with panchromatic and multispectral resolutions of similar to 30 cm and similar to 1.2 m, respectively, (2) developing multiple fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) that can learn the morphological features of water bodies in addition to their spectral properties, and (3) FCN that can classify water even from panchromatic imagery. This study focuses on rivers in the Arctic, using images from the Quickbird-2, WorldView-1, WorldView-2, WorldView-3, and GeoEye satellites. Because no training data are available at such high resolutions, we construct those manually. First, we use the red, green, blue, and near-infrared bands of the 8-band multispectral sensors. Those trained models all achieve excellent precision and recall over 90% on validation data, aided by on-the-fly preprocessing of the training data specific to satellite imagery. In a novel approach, we then use results from the multispectral model to generate training data for FCN that only require panchromatic imagery, of which considerably more is available. Despite the smaller feature space, these models still achieve a precision and recall of over 85%. We provide our open-source codes and trained model parameters to the remote sensing community, which paves the way to a wide range of environmental hydrology applications at vastly superior accuracies and 1-2 orders of magnitude higher spatial resolution than previously possible.

AB Warming induced shifts in tundra vegetation composition and structure, including circumpolar expansion of shrubs, modifies ecosystem structure and functioning with potentially global consequences due to feedback mechanisms between vegetation and climate. Satellite-derived vegetation indices indicate widespread greening of the surface, often associated with regional evidence of shrub expansion obtained from long-term ecological monitoring and repeated orthophotos. However, explicitly quantifying shrub expansion across large scales using satellite observations requires characterising the fine-scale mosaic of Arctic vegetation types beyond index-based approaches. Although previous studies have illustrated the potential of estimating fractional cover of various Plant Functional Types (PFTs) from satellite imagery, limited availability of reference data across space and time has constrained deriving fraction cover time series capable of detecting shrub expansion. We applied regressionbased unmixing using synthetic training data to build multitemporal machine learning models in order to estimate fractional cover of shrubs and other surface components in the Mackenzie Delta Region for six time intervals between 1984 and 2020. We trained Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models using Landsat-derived spectral-temporal-metrics and synthetic training data generated from pure class spectra obtained directly from the imagery. Independent validation using very-high-resolution imagery suggested that KRR outperforms RFR, estimating shrub cover with a MAE of 10.6% and remaining surface components with MAEs between 3.0 and 11.2%. Canopy-forming shrubs were well modelled across all cover densities, coniferous tree cover tended to be overestimated and differentiating between herbaceous and lichen cover was challenging. Shrub cover expanded by on average + 2.2% per decade for the entire study area and + 4.2% per decade within the low Arctic tundra, while relative changes were strongest in the northernmost regions. In conjunction with shrub expansion, we observed herbaceous plant and lichen cover decline. Our results corroborate the perception of the replacement and homogenisation of Arctic vegetation communities facilitated by the competitive advantage of shrub species under a warming climate. The proposed method allows for multidecadal quantitative estimates of fractional cover at 30 m resolution, initiating new opportunities for mapping past and present fractional cover of tundra PFTs and can help advance our understanding of Arctic shrub expansion within the vast and heterogeneous tundra biome.

TI Application of an improved multi-temporal InSAR method and forward

   Loess Plateau following land reclamation in the Yan'an New District

AB Land reclamation in the Yan'an New District (YND) on the Chinese Loess Plateau is one of the largest earthworks projects in the world, involving the excavation of loess from ridges and the deposition of the material in adjacent valleys, flattening an area of more than 78 km2. It can take multiple years for the landscape to adjust to the new topography after the earthworks are completed, with subsidence in the fill areas and uplift in the areas of excavation. Understanding the pattern and extent of this differential vertical movement has great importance for ensuring the structural integrity of any infrastructure built on the site. We therefore studied the spatial deformation field of the YND from January 2015 to December 2018 using satellite synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technology. Persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS) were combined in a twotier network to overcome problems with temporal decorrelation of the InSAR phase signals. The derived deformation field was validated with in-situ ground leveling and GNSS measurements, and interpreted using a forward geophysical model. The results indicate that our approach provides a more detailed understanding of the deformation than conventional PSI and SBAS methods. Subsidence of up to 87 mm/yr occurred over about 4.4 km2 of the fill region, and uplift of up to 26 mm/yr in the excavated areas. There is a strong linear relationship between these displacements and prior topographic elevation change. The primary cause of subsidence in fill areas is compaction of remoulded loess. Instantaneous elastic and gradual poroelastic deformation are the main causes of uplift in excavated areas.

AB Forest disturbances can have broad impact on the climate, local environment, and the regeneration of the forest ecosystem. The nature and magnitude of such impact is largely driven by disturbance intensity. In this study, by integrating field plot measurements collected by the Forest Inventory and Analysis program with time series Landsat observations, we produced the first set of annual forest disturbance intensity map products quantifying the percentage of basal area removal (PBAR) at the 30-m resolution for the conterminous United States (CONUS) from 1986 to 2015. The derived map products revealed that during the 30-year study period, the annual average PBAR values of all disturbed pixels across CONUS ranged from 66% to 70%, and the proportion of those pixels having stand-clearing disturbances ranged from 40% to 58%. High disturbance intensities were concentrated in the Southeastern states from Texas to Virginia and along the Pacific coast and the Cascades in the West. At the national scale, the annual mean PBAR and proportion of stand clearing area (PSCA) values both appeared to follow second order trajectories, with increasing trends at the beginning, decreasing trends towards the end, and turning points around 2003. Overall, there is a net increase of 2% in PBAR and 3% in PSCA from 1986 to 2015. The temporal trends of PBAR and PSCA were also investigated at state and ecoregion levels, with substantial differences found among many states and ecoregions. While states and ecoregions generally follow second order trajectories, the majority had increasing trends throughout much of the study period, reflecting higher disturbance intensities during the later years compared to earlier years. Large increase (>10%) in PBAR was seen in several states (e.g., Virginia, Arkansas, and Minnesota) and ecoregions (e.g., Northern Minnesota Wetlands); however, large decreases (>10%) in PBAR were not observed in any states, and were seen in only one ecoregion, the Blue Mountains in the southeast. The disturbance intensity maps are available from a web portal of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL-DAAC) at https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNL DAAC/2059.

AB Extraction of digital terrain model (DTM) from Digital Surface Model (DSM) still faces many problems in a complex scene with geometric ambiguities such as steep slope forested environments and contiguous non-ground regions. In this paper, an approach based on deep learning is proposed to generate DTM directly from DSM without applying filtering methods for eliminating non-ground pixels. In this regard, first, in the preprocessing step, the data is prepared for entering into the proposed deep network. Then, a hybrid deep convolutional neural network (HDCNN) is proposed which is a combination of the U-net architecture and residual networks. In this network, effective features are generate4d in different scales during the downsampling process from the input DSM and the DTM is extracted during the upsampling process. To rectify the results, a multi-scale fusion strategy is proposed to produce the final DTM by fusing the generated DTMs at different scales and with different spatial shifts. The performance of the proposed approach is analyzed by implementing four different evaluation scenarios in five different datasets. The evaluation results demonstrated significant performance and high generalizability of the proposed approach. The proposed network also outperforms the deep learning-based filtering methods and two reference DTM extraction algorithms especially in challenging regions.

AB Mounting evidence indicates dryland ecosystems play an important role in driving the interannual variability and trend of the terrestrial carbon sink. Nevertheless, our understanding of the seasonal dynamics of dryland ecosystem carbon uptake through photosynthesis [gross primary productivity (GPP)] remains relatively limited due in part to the limited availability of long-term data and unique challenges associated with satellite remote sensing across dryland ecosystems. Here, we comprehensively evaluated longstanding and emerging satellite vegetation proxies in their ability to capture seasonal dryland GPP dynamics. Specifically, we evaluated: 1) reflectance-based proxies normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), near infrared reflectance index (NIRv), and kernel NDVI (kNDVI) from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); and 2) newly available physiologically-based proxy solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). As a performance benchmark, we used GPP estimates from a robust network of 21 western United States eddy covariance tower sites that span representative gradients in dryland ecosystem climate and functional composition. We found that NIRv and SIF were the best performing GPP proxies and captured complementary aspects of seasonal GPP dynamics across dryland ecosystem types. NIRv offered better performance than the other proxies across relatively low-productivity, sparsely non-evergreen vegetated sites (R2 = 0.59 +/- 0.13); whereas SIF best captured seasonal dynamics across relatively high-productivity sites, including evergreen-dominated sites (R2 = 0.74 +/- 0.07). Notably, across grass-dominated sites, all reflectance-based proxies (NDVI, SAVI, NIRv and kNDVI) showed significant seasonal bias (hysteresis) that strengthened with the total fraction of woody vegetation cover, likely due to seasonal patterns in woody vegetation reflectance that are unrelated to or decoupled from GPP. Future efforts to fully integrate the complementary strengths of NIRv and SIF could significantly improve our understanding and representation of dryland GPP dynamics in satellite-based models.

AB The two-source energy balance (TSEB) model using the land surface temperature (LST) as a key boundary has been used to estimate land surface evapotranspiration (ET) over various landcovers and environmental conditions. However, LST may not always provide an adequate boundary condition to simultaneously constrain the soil evaporation and plant transpiration especially under water limited conditions. A refinement to TSEB model by coupling surface soil moisture information to derive the soil and vegetation component temperatures and a new transpiration algorithm was developed (TSEB-SM). The TSEB-SM model was evaluated under a wide range of surface soil water content values and vegetation cover conditions and compared with the performance with the original TSEB model using only LST. While the results showed that the TSEB-SM model produced similar agreement in the fluxes and ET as the original TSEB for the cropland and grassland sites, TSEB-SM model performance was notably improved at the shrub-forest and desert steppe sites with a significant reduction in mean absolute percent difference in daily ET from nearly 65% to 25% and from approximately 50% to 40%, respectively. It also appears to be more reliable in partitioning ET into soil evaporation and plant transpiration when compared to the partitioning using the water use efficiency (uWUE) approach in combination with the eddy covariance measurements. With satellite data such as MODIS LST and leaf area index, and surface soil moisture retrievals from microwave satellite observations, the TSEB-SM model may potentially be a more reliable tool for monitoring regional ET partitioning under sparse canopy cover conditions.

AB Continuous monitoring of glacial lakes, their parent glaciers and their surroundings is crucial because possible outbursts of these lakes pose a serious hazard to downstream areas. Ongoing climate change increases the risk of this hazard globally due to recession of glaciers leading to formation and expansion of glacial lakes, and permafrost degradation which impacts the stability of glaciers, slopes and moraines. Here, we demonstrate the capability of our approach for monitoring lake outburst susceptibility using time-series of Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (S-1 SAR) data. We selected Lunana in the Bhutanese Himalayas as an example region as it is highly susceptible to glacial lake outburst floods and suitable baseline data were available. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to calculate average radar backscatter intensity (ARBI) of glaciers, lakes, basins, and moraines. To determine the periodicity of the highest and the lowest radar backscatter intensity, we denoised the ARBI data using a Fast Fourier Transform and autocorrelated using a Pearson correlation function. Additionally, we determined glacier melt area, basin melt area, lake area, open water area, and lake ice area using radar backscatter intensity data. The Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique was used to investigate the stability of moraines and slopes around glacial lakes. The PSI results were qualitatively validated by comparison with high-resolution digital elevation model differencing results. Our approach showed that glaciers and basins in the region underwent seasonal and periodic changes in their radar backscatter intensity related to changes in ice and snow melt. Lakes also showed seasonal changes in their radar backscatter intensity related to the variation of lake ice and open water area, but the radar backscatter intensity change was not periodic. We could also infer lake area change using a time-series radar backscatter intensity data such as the rapid expansion of Bechung Tsho. The PSI analysis showed that all the terminal moraines were stable except Drukchung Tsho. Its terminal moraine showed subsidence at the rate of -5.18 mm/yr. Sidewalls of lakes were also stable with the exception of Lugge Tsho at site 4. Due to the free availability of S-1 SAR data, the efficiency of processing a large amount of imagery within GEE, and the PSI technique, we were able to understand the outburst susceptibility of glacial lakes in the region at great detail. The regular acquisition of S-1 SAR data enables continuous monitoring of glacial lakes. A similar approach and concept can be transferred to any geographic region on earth that shares similar challenges in glacial lake monitoring.

AB A well-performed (root mean square error approximate to 0.35 m) look-up table model was established to separate the wind-sea and swell significant wave height (H-s) using 10-m sea surface wind speed (U-10) and H-s data from altimeters. Based on this model, global wind-sea and swell climate and variability were investigated using 27-year jointly calibrated altimeter data. The climatology of the swell and wind-sea H-s (H-WS and H-SW) are in good agreement with those of the total H-s and U-10, respectively. This is because of the dominance of swells in the World Ocean with respect to both occurrence frequency and energy proportion and the close coupling between wind and wind-seas. The interannual variability of H-WS and H-SW are closely related to some climate indices, but the responses of wind-seas and swells are different for the same atmospheric oscillation because of the large propagation distances of swells. For long-term variability, significant positive/negative long-term trends of H-WS/H-SW were found almost all over the World Ocean. Such opposite trends can be explained by the positive/negative trends of U-10/H-s: a shorter fetch or duration of wind leads to a lower H-s, but a higher U-10 leads to higher wind-sea probability and energy weight. However, large uncertainty still exists in these trends and further exploration is needed.

AB Accurate estimation of leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) is critical to characterize ecosystem and plant physiological processes for example in carbon fixation. Remote sensing can capture LNC, while interrelated traits and spectral diversity across plant species prevent development of transferable LNC assessment models based on leaf reflectance. Here, we developed a new transfer learning method by coupling transfer component analysis with the support vector regression, namely TCA-SVR, to transfer LNC assessment models across different plant species. We benchmarked the performance of TCA-SVR against a well-established partial least squares regression (PLSR) model with five remote sensing datasets on 60 plant species measured from three spectroradiometers with varied spectral resolutions and illumination and viewing angles. The result showed that leaf reflectance presented the high spectral diversity in different spectral regions, plant species, and growth stages. The combination of visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance (e.g. 550-2300 nm) achieved the optimal LNC assessment across all datasets. Results on the testing datasets showed that the transferability of the PLSR models highly depended on the LNC distribution and spectral features, which were associated with the differences in plant species, spectral measurements, and growth conditions between datasets. These differences led to the large variations in LNC and leaf reflectance, which thus produced the overestimations and underestimations of LNC. Compared to the PLSR model, TCA-SVR greatly improved the transferability of the LNC assessment model by reducing the average root mean square error by 36.76%. Further, the implementation of modeling updating can help TCA-SVR learn the features related to the difference in plant species and LNC ranges by transferring samples from the target dataset to the source dataset. Our model updating approach improved the performance of TCA-SVR and only needed 5% of the off-site samples to supplement the source dataset to achieve an effective assessment of LNC. Refining the proposed method with new remote sensing datasets will aid rapid monitoring of plant nitrogen status and may improve carbon-nitrogen interactions in existing ecosystem models.

AB Fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 ism (PM2.5) profoundly affects environmental systems and human health. To dynamically monitor fine particulate matter over large geographic areas, some machine learning methods have been utilized to estimate its concentration using satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD). To improve the estimation of PM2.5 concentration across large areas, a geospatial-temporal joint code is proposed in this paper to characterize the influence of spatial-temporal information hidden in satellitebased aerosol products. This encoding method can reveal the relationship between the PM2.5 concentration and its geospatial location and observation time. Instead of aggregating observation data over neighbors, the method directly encodes the spatial-temporal information as features of the end-to-end gradient boosting model for the estimation of PM2.5. Experimental results of PM2.5 concentration in 2019 across China show that the state-of-theart method is outperformed by the proposed method by a large margin, with R-2 from 0.89 to 0.92, RMSE from 10.35 to 7.89 mu g/m(3), and MAE from 6.71 to 5.17 mu g/m(3). In addition, overall partial dependence plots (PDPs) are used for the first time to visualize the complicated relationship between satellite-based aerosol products and PM2.5 concentrations.

AB Calving Front (CF) is an important parameter to analyse ice sheet dynamics and to measure glacier mass balance. DEM products covering polar regions are critical remote sensing data sources to provide fundamental terrain information for glaciological studies. It is necessary to provide accurate CFs for DEM specific applications, such as mass balance calculation or the substitution of water values with geoid values in the DEM editing process. However, much less attention is paid to automatically delineate CFs from DEM data. In this study, we propose a DEM-based Automatic CF Extraction method (DACE) to efficiently extract the CFs from DEM data. In DACE, a height-sensitive terrain feature is designed to enhance the contrast between the ice sheet and the ocean by combining elevation and roughness information. To improve the CF extraction performance, a two-category image classification based on game theory is proposed that considers the spatial consistency of the feature image created. For validation, DACE was applied to DEM products generated from the single-pass SAR interferometry mission TanDEM-X (TDM) at different posting sizes (12 and 90 m) and to the optical photogrammetrybased Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA) with a 2 m posting. The proposed algorithm can achieve a CF extraction accuracy of better than 14, 20, and 70 m for the 2-m REMA, 12-and 90-m TDM DEMs, respectively, when compared with the manually delineated CFs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively extract the CFs from DEM data. DACE can be used to replace water values and edit the DEMs themselves. The CFs extracted from the DEM data can also be used for glacier mass balance calculation with the DEM-based geodetic method and for the temporal analysis of CF changes when multi temporal DEM data are available.

AB Deriving land cover from remotely sensed data is fundamental to many operational mapping and reporting programs as well as providing core information to support science activities. The ability to generate land cover maps has benefited from free and open access to imagery, as well as increased storage and computational power. The accuracy of the land cover maps is directly linked to the calibration (or training) data used, the predictors and ancillary data included in the classification model, and the implementation of the classification, among other factors (e.g., classification algorithm, land cover heterogeneity). Various means for improving calibration data can be implemented, including using independent datasets to further refine training data prior to mapping. Opportunities also arise from a profusion of possible calibration datasets from pre-existing land cover products (static and time series) and forest inventory maps through to observation from airborne and spaceborne lidar observations. In this research, for the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada, we explored approaches to refine calibration data, integrate novel predictors, and optimize classifier implementation. We refined calibration data using measures of forest vertical structure, integrated novel spatial (via distance-to metrics) model predictors, and implemented a regionalized approach for optimizing training data selection and model-building to ensure local relevance of calibration data and capture of regional variability in land cover conditions. We found that additional vetting of training data involved the removal of 44.7% of erroneous samples (e.g. treed vegetation without vertical structure) from the training pool. Nationally, distance to ephemeral waterbodies was a key predictor of land cover, while the importance of distance to permanent water bodies varied on a regional basis. Regionalization of model implementation ensured that classification models used locally relevant descriptors and resulted in improved classification outcomes (overall accuracy: 77.9% +/- 1.4%) compared to a generalized, national model (70.3% +/- 2.5%). The methodological developments presented herein are portable to other land cover projects, monitoring programs, and remotely sensed data sources. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data for land cover mapping, as well as non-image data for aiding with model development (from calibration data to complementary spatial data layers) provide new opportunities to improve and further automate land cover mapping procedures.

AB Severe droughts caused unprecedented impacts on grasslands in Central Europe in 2018 and 2019. Yet, spatially varying drought impacts on grasslands remain poorly understood as they are driven by complex interactions of environmental conditions and land management. Sentinel-2 time series offer untapped potential for improving grassland monitoring during droughts with the required spatial and temporal detail. In this study, we quantified drought effects in a major Central European grassland region from 2017 to 2020 using a regression-based unmixing framework. The Sentinel-2-based intra-annual time series of photosynthetic vegetation (PV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil fractional cover provide easily interpretable quantities relevant for understanding drought effects on grasslands. Fractional cover estimates from Sentinel-2 matched in-situ conditions observed during field visits. The comparison to a multitemporal reference dataset showed the best agreement for PV cover (MAE = 7.2%). Agreement was lower for soil and NPV, but we observed positive relationships between fractional cover from Sentinel-2 and the reference data with MAE = 10.1% and MAE = 15.4% for soil and NPV, respectively. Based on the fractional cover estimates, we derived a Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) time series contrasting NPV and soil cover relative to PV. In line with meteorological and soil moisture drought indices, and with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), NDFI time series showed the most severe drought impacts in 2018, followed by less severe, but persisting effects in 2019. Drought-specific metrics from NDFI time series revealed a high spatial variability of onset, duration, impact, and end of drought effects on grasslands. Evaluating drought metrics on different soil types, we found that grasslands on less productive, sandy Cambisols were strongly affected by the drought in 2018 and 2019. In comparison, grasslands on Gleysols and Histosols were less severely impacted suggesting a higher drought resistance of these grasslands. Our study emphasizes that the high temporal and spatial detail of Sentinel-2 time series is mandatory for capturing relevant vegetation dynamics in Central European lowland grasslands under drought.

AB In GPR profiles, ice is usually imaged as a mostly electromagnetic transparent facies. However, diffraction events, as well as internal layering, can be also observed. In some cases, the bedrock below glaciers is masked by dense diffractions usually interpreted as the effect of liquid water pockets inside the so-called warm ice. However, the actual physical meaning of such GPR facies is not always obvious, because it can be related also to mixed debris and ice deposits. We adopted a strategy well known in medical sciences and referred as "differential diagnosis" in order to infer which is the actual meaning of a high scattering facies imaged within the Eastern Gran Zebru glacier (Central Italian Alps) and, more generally, of all the internal glacier features. In fact, in many cases, there is no direct information to limit the subjectivity of geophysical interpretation; therefore, we provide all the discriminative hypotheses based on both independent and integrated criteria including GPR attribute analysis, imaging effects, reflection analysis, GPR frequency evaluations combined with geomorphological and remote sensing data obtained by two photogrammetric UAV and thermal infrared surveys. On the basis of the differential diagnosis, we concluded that the high scattering zone embedded within the studied glacier is most likely related to a mixture of ice and debris probably formed during a past shrinking phase. Beside this case study, this approach could be helpful in other GPR glaciological surveys, in which the target is related not only to the bedrock detection, but also to a detailed analysis of the internal facies of a glacier.

AB The wind direction dependence of the fully polarimetric ocean emissivity at L-band is studied using a semitheoretical approach. The model, which is tuned and validated against Aquarius and Soil Moisture ActivePassive (SMAP) mission observations, incorporates the two-scale polarimetric ocean emission model, an improved directional wave spectrum, the Anguelova and Gaiser, 2013 (AG13) foam emissivity model and a novel foam coverage model. Wind speeds up to 35 m/s are considered. Comparisons of model simulations to satellite data show that the overall accuracy of model could reach 0.2 K, which is slightly worse than the Aquarius geophysical mode function (GMF) error of about 0.14 K. The negative and positive upwind-crosswind asymmetries of L-band ocean emission and the transition of the phase signatures versus wind speed are well reproduced for all polarizations by the proposed model. The average standard deviations of the differences of polarimetric brightness temperature (TB) between observations and model are less than about 0.16 K for wind speeds up to 15 m/s. Simulations also indicate the anisotropy of L-band ocean emissivities for V- and H- pol would be saturated at high wind speeds. The directional signals at the third Stokes component begin to converge at around the wind speed of 24 m/s. The L-band TB variations due to wind direction for the third Stokes parameter show less sensitivity to wind speed at larger observation angles, while the direction-induced TB variations for the fourth Stokes are more sensitive to wind speed with the increase of observation angle.

AB The prescription of surface emissivity (epsilon) strongly controls satellite-derived estimates of land surface temperature (LST). This is particularly important for studying surface urban heat islands (SUHI) since built-up and natural landscapes are known to have distinct epsilon values. Given the small signal associated with the SUHI compared to LST, accurately prescribing urban and rural epsilon would improve our satellite-derived SUHI estimates. Here we test the sensitivity of SUHI to the epsilon assumption made while deriving LST from Landsat measurements for almost 10,000 global urban clusters for summer and winter days. We find that adjusting the epsilon values from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) dataset based on pixel-level normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increases the summer to winter contrast in daytime SUHI, a constrast that has been noted in previous studies. Overall, the difference between the two methods of prescribing epsilon, one from ASTER and one after NDVI-adjustment, is moderate; around 10% during summer and around 20% during winter, though this difference varies by climate zone, showing higher deviations in polar and temperate climate. We also combine five different methods of prescribing emissivity to provide the first global estimates of SUHI derived from Landsat. The global ensemble mean SUHI varies between 2.42 degrees C during summer to 0.46 degrees C in winter. Regardless of the surface emissivity model used, compared to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra observations, Landsat data show higher SUHI daytime intensities during summer (by more than 1.5 degrees C), partly due to its ability to better resolve urban pixels. We also find that the epsilon values prescribed for urban land cover in global and regional weather models are lower than the satellite-derived broadband epsilon values. Computing sensitivities of urban and rural LST to epsilon, we demonstrate that this would lead to overestimation of SUHI by these models (by around 4 degrees C for both summer and winter), all else remaining constant. Our analysis provides a global perspective on the importance of better constraining urban epsilon for comparing satellite-derived and model-simulated SUHI intensities. Since both the structural and geometric heterogeneity of the surface controls the bulk epsilon, future studies should try to benchmark the suitability of existing LST-epsilon separation methods over urban areas.

An overall consistency in the a(cdom)(443) estimated from S2011, C2017 and CDOM-KD2 models with a slightly better performance of the latter method was observed (MAPD of 27.42% and 30.85% for open ocean with in situ and satellite data, respectively), emphasizing the possible specific assessment of a(cdom)(443) dynamics from satellite remote sensing over the global ocean including the most oligotrophic waters. At 443 nm the global average relative contribution of a(cdom)(443) to the absorption by colored detrital matter, a(cdm)(443) is of 61% +/- 14%, while the contribution of a(cdom)(443) to the non-water absorption, anw(443), is of 35% +/- 26%. Strong spatial disparities are however observed for both a(cdom)(443) temporal dynamics and relative contribution in the absorption budget. A decoupling is observed between acdom(443) and particulate detrital (i.e. non-living) matter and phytoplankton in the gyre areas where a low temporal variability is globally observed. This is contrasting with water masses influenced by terrestrial inputs as well as in equatorial and subtropical areas impacted by main oceanic currents where CDOM loads and a(cdom)(443) contribution in the water absorption budget are more variable.

AB Among the many calcifying marine organisms, coccolithophores are the major producer of particulate inorganic carbon (PIC). Calcium carbonate plates covering coccolithophores, called coccoliths and released during blooms, are responsible for a large increase of the water reflectance. Aiming at investigating the spectral features of the remote sensing reflectance R-RS(lambda) of marine waters during coccolithophore blooms, this study exploits the radiometric data of Ocean Color sites of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) in the Western Black Sea (Galata and Gloria/Section-7) by focusing on bloom events that occurred in 2017 and 2020. The analysis, besides showing elevated R-RS(lambda) in the blue-green spectral region in the presence of coccoliths, confirms a shift toward the blue of the R-RS(lambda) spectra as the bloom declines and coccoliths accumulate at the surface. Results also document a decreased capability of determining the bloom state in the presence of optically complex waters such as those associated with river runoff. Finally, the comparison of satellite versus AERONET-OC radiometric data for the extreme conditions created by the presence of coccolithophores, indicates agreements between R-RS(lambda) not significantly different from those previously determined for various satellite data products in the absence of appreciable concentrations of coccoliths.

AB Aerosol pollution is an acute environmental issue in developing countries. Asia has been experiencing rapid changes in anthropogenic aerosols during the past two decades due to fast growth in population and economy. It is still an open question how aerosol loadings, represented by aerosol optical depth (AOD), have evolved in this century, particularly during the past decade when China and India implemented a clean air act aiming to improve air quality. Based on Terra aerosol retrievals and aerosol reanalysis, a change point of AOD trend is detected at 2010 in East China versus a persistent increasing AOD trend in the Indian subcontinent with no detectable change point from 2000 to 2019. In East China, positive AOD trend (+0.11 +/- 0.022 decade- 1) is confirmed from 2000 to 2010 (hereinafter the former period) yet negative trend (-0.26 +/- 0.027 decade- 1) is identified from 2011 to 2019 (hereinafter the later period). In the Indian subcontinent, persistent positive trend (+0.04 +/- 0.001) is detected from 2000 to 2019 (hereinafter the whole period). All of these trends are attributed mainly to changes in sulfate aerosols. Further analysis of the aerosol pollution extreme events (APEE; defined as daily AOD over the long-term local 90th AOD percentile) manifest a positive trend (+0.16 +/- 0.029 decade- 1) of the APEEs' magnitude in East China during the former period yet a negative trend (-0.11 +/- 0.020 decade- 1) during the latter period; the Indian subcontinent demonstrates a positive trend (+0.02 +/- 0.004 decade- 1) during the whole period due to increasing sulfate aerosols. The APEEs have become more frequent (+3.5 +/- 0.53 day month-1 decade- 1) in East China during the former period yet less frequent (-3.6 +/- 0.39 day month-1 decade-1) during the latter period; in the Indian subcontinent, more frequent APEEs (+1.1 +/- 0.25 day month-1 decade- 1) have been detected during the whole period. Consistent with the AOD trends, clear-sky radiation in East China shows a negative trend at the surface (-3.2 +/- 0.67 W m- 2 decade- 1), a positive trend in the atmosphere (+1.4 +/- 0.68 decade- 1), and a negative trend at the top of the atmosphere (-1.8 +/- 0.43 decade- 1) during the former period, respectively; opposite trends with much larger magnitude are seen during the latter period. In the Indian subcontinent, the clear-sky radiation trends during the whole period are -1.4 +/- 0.38, +1.7 +/- 0.31, and + 0.5 +/- 0.16 W m- 2 decade- 1 at the surface, in the atmosphere, and at the top of the atmosphere, respectively. Comparison of radiation trends at clear-sky and all-sky conditions suggests that absorbing aerosols dominate the radiation budget in the atmosphere and the aerosol reanalysis of the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research ans Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) might overestimate the radiation response to clouds. This study provides an up-to-date analysis of the long-term trends in aerosols and their extreme events and radiation in two of the world's heavily polluted regions and the results have important implications for assessment of the environmental and climatic impacts of the ongoing clean air acts in Asia.

TI Sentinel-3 active fire detection and FRP product performance-Impact of
   scan angle and SLSTR middle infrared channel selection

AB The Sentinel-3 satellites each carry the dual-Earth view Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). SLSTR data from the `near nadir' scan are used to produce a set of global, daily active fire (AF) products similar to those produced from MODIS data. The Sentinel-3 AF products are generated in both Near Real Time (NRT) and Non Time Critical (NTC) mode and are expected ultimately to replace those from MODIS Terra when that mission starts to reach its end of life. Middle infrared (MIR) observations are critical for the AF application, and SLSTR has two MIR channels (S7 and F1) based on different detector designs and located at different positions in the instrument focal plane, delivering different dynamic ranges with the same spectral response function. The SLSTR AF detection and FRP retrieval algorithm uses both S7 and F1 channel data, but there are options on how these are combined to generate the final AF products. Past work has shown that MODIS' AF product characteristics are strongly view zenith angle (VZA) dependent, and since the SLSTR `near nadir' scan actually extends out to a maximum VZA of 55. (similar to the maximum MODIS VZA), any such view angle dependency may also impact the choice of how the S7 and F1 channel data are combined to generate the SLSTR AF products. Here we use a combination of simulation modelling and analysis of more than 15,000 early SLSTR AF products to study how VZA affects the Sentinel-3 AF product characteristics, and how this varies when the S7 and F1 channel data are combined in different ways. Maximum use of S7 channel data provides an AF product whose statistical characteristics vary markedly with VZA around the near nadir scan. For example, the median FRP extracted from the more than 15,000 products studied varies by around an order of magnitude between the centre and edge of scan positions, a level of VZA-dependency similar to that seen with the MODIS AF products. By contrast, maximum use of data from the F1 channel provides a median FRP that varies only by a factor of similar to 3 over the same VZA range. Our simulation modelling demonstrates that this difference is a result of the area of the F1 channel ground pixel footprint remaining far more consistent around the near nadir scan compared to that of S7, which also leads to minimised F1 pixel oversampling even at high VZA observations. The result is that FRP retrievals for a fire derived using the F1 channel observations are far less sensitive to where in the scan the fire is observed. When generated in this way, the Sentinel-3 FRP product characteristics appear similar to those of the VIIRS AF products, since VIIRS also has a method of minimising pixel area growth away from nadir. We conclude that maximum use of the SLSTR F1 channel observations provides significant benefits to the Sentinel-3 AF product, and that unless there are other reasons not to do so any operational processing to generate the NRT and NTC product versions should consider this option as the default. Our findings also show the value of the novel detector design of the SLSTR F1 channel, whose advantageous pixel footprint characteristics mean that similar designs should be considered for future sensors aiming to support active fire applications.

AB We use satellite observations from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) to map and quantify methane emissions from eastern Mexico using an atmospheric inverse analysis. Eastern Mexico covers the vast majority of the national oil and gas production. Using TROPOMI measurements from May 2018 to December 2019, our methane emission estimates for eastern Mexico are 5.0 +/- 0.2 Tg a-1 for anthropogenic sources and 1.5 +/- 0.1 Tg a-1 for natural sources, representing 45% and 34% higher annual methane fluxes respectively compared to the most recent estimates based on the Mexican national greenhouse gas inventory. Our results show that Mexico's oil and gas sector has the largest discrepancy, with oil and gas emissions (1.3 +/- 0.2 Tg a-1) higher by a factor of two relative to bottom-up estimates-accounting for a quarter of total anthropogenic emissions. Our satellite-based inverse modeling estimates show that more than half of the oil/gas emissions in eastern Mexico are from the southern onshore basin (0.79 +/- 0.13 Tg a-1), pointing at high emission sources which are not represented in current bottom-up inventories (e.g., venting of associated gas, high-emitting gathering/processing facilities related to the transport of associated gas from offshore). These findings suggest that stronger mitigation measures are critical to curbing the anthropogenic footprint of methane emissions in Mexico, especially the large contribution from the oil and gas sector.

AB The science teams of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) have been supporting various global climate, biogeochemistry, and energy flux research efforts by producing valuable long-term Leaf Area Index (LAI) products. Although intensive LAI validation studies have been carried out globally, retrieval accuracy has been assessed only over short time spans and product quality is reported as a constant based on the assumption that it is stationary. However, a preliminary evaluation found a time-dependent signal degradation of the MODIS sensors which may cause the uncertainty of the Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) product to exceed the preset uncertainty buffer in the retrieval algorithm and result in MODIS LAI quality variation and time-series inconsistency with VIIRS LAI. Therefore, to ensure the reliability of trend-detection studies and to answer the critical question of whether the algorithm configuration is still suitable for the uncertainty level of present BRF product, there is a need for a more comprehensive investigation regarding the performance stability of LAI retrieval algorithm due to model uncertainty and input uncertainties. This paper reports analyses of inter-annual stability and trends of LAI uncertainties (inferred from product quality flag rather than ground-based validation) as well as LAI magnitudes using multi-year (MODIS: 2001-2019, VIIRS: 2013-2019) and multi-site (445 sites) datasets. We found that the quality metrics of the two products are consistent across different biome types and LAI values (R2 ranged from 0.88 to 0.99). In the 19-year MODIS period, we found a significant increasing trend in LAI magnitudes (4.5%/ decade) which agrees with previous reports, while there was no significant trend in product quality. Moreover, quality metrics showed much smaller inter-annual variations than LAI values, which confirms the performance stability of retrieval algorithms and suggests that the configuration of MODIS algorithm is still compatible with the uncertainty of algorithm inputs. Additionally, this study provides support to the "Greening Asia" studies by eliminating the possibility that the "greening" could be attributed to artificial trends caused by sensor degradation. We also found very small inter-annual variations in atmospheric conditions (e.g., cloud and aerosols), which further assures that the performance stability of retrieval algorithm. Overall, our results demonstrate the robustness of the retrieval algorithm in the presence of changes in input uncertainties. The temporal stability of the algorithm performance indirectly strengthen the confidence in the continuous use of MODIS LAI products either independently or in combination with its successor - VIIRS LAI - to study global and regional vegetation dynamics

AB Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable that plays an important role in land-atmosphere interactions. Monitoring SM is crucial for many applications and can help to determine the impact of climate change. Therefore, it is essential to have continuous and long-term databases for this variable. Satellite missions have contributed to this; however, the continuity of the series is compromised due to the data gaps derived by different factors, including revisit time, presence of seasonal ice or Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) contamination. In this work, the applicability of different gap-filling techniques is evaluated on the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM combined product, which is the longest available satellite-based SM data record. The methods used were linear, cubic and autoregressive interpolation and support vector machines (SVMs). This study focused on Southern Europe and spanned the years 2003?2015. The different methods were applied in the temporal and spatial domains and evaluated using the holdout cross-validation technique. A set of variables was introduced in the SVM model to estimate SM, namely, land surface temperature, precipitation, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), potential evaporation, soil texture and geographical coordinates. For the SVMs, several combinations of these variables were considered, including a principal component analysis (PCA) containing all of them. Although the different methods show a generally good performance, the SVM method outperforms the rest. Using the SM of the precedent day (SMt-1) is key to obtain good estimates. The median value of the correlation coefficient (R) obtained with the SVM and the SMt-1 series in the temporal analysis was 0.83, and the RMSE was 0.025 m3m? 3. Similar results were obtained in the spatial analysis, with the best performance (R = 0.88; RMSE = 0.024 m3m? 3) obtained by the SVM using the SMt-1 series and the static variables. The application of PCA to input variables was not beneficial, and the interpolation methods failed when dealing with large spatial or temporal gaps. A validation of the CCI SM series with in situ SM data from four networks located in Spain, France, Germany and Italy was also performed and no substantial differences were observed between results obtained with the original and with the reconstructed series. In addition, best inputs obtained with SVM were used to evaluate the random forest (RF) method in the temporal and spatial domain. This method showed a good ability to estimate soil moisture values in the temporal domain but to a lesser extent than SVM while for the spatial domain it did not seem to be as accurate. Our results confirm that we can efficiently deal with spatio-temporal gaps on observational SM databases using the SVM method and the past time series and soil texture as supporting information.

AB Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is a vital variable for vegetation growth, drought monitoring and agricultural water management. Satellite remote sensing measures soil moisture at the surface layer, while RZSM is derived usually by model-based simulations. Here, we provide the first comprehensive evaluation of eight RZSM products at a global scale, including GLDAS NOAH, ERA-5, MERRA-2, NCEP R1, NCEP R2, JRA-55, SMAP level 4 and SMOS level 4 datasets. An in-situ validation based on the stations from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and a triple collocation (TC) evaluation are both conducted to assess the accuracy of these RZSM products. SMAP exhibits the median highest correlation and the median lowest RMSE with in-situ stations over North America. In the TC analysis, MERRA-2 shows the highest median correlation and the median lowest error standard deviation with the unknown truth, followed by GLDAS, SMAP, JRA-55 and ERA-5. A temporal pattern analysis indicates that SMOS has a dry bias relative to other datasets and NCEP R1 has larger seasonal variations relative to other datasets over Asia and North America. The TC analysis indicates that MERRA-2, SMAP, GLDAS, JRA-55, and ERA-5 have better performance relative to other datasets. SMAP is not as good as GLDAS, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 in RZSM estimation over forest areas. The possible factors influencing RZSM performance are discussed, including precipitation forcing, assimilated observations, radio frequency interference issue and validation methods. These results and conclusions may provide new insights for the improvement of model-based RZSM estimation.

AB Remote sensing tools have proven to be effective for direct detection of petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) in continental areas. PHC yield diagnostic absorption features in the near, shortwave, midwave, and thermal infrared (NIR-SWIR-MWIR-TIR) ranges. Thus far, the NIR-SWIR range has been primarily exploited for remote sensing PHC detection, whereas the application of MWIR and TIR data has remained underexplored. In this work, we aim to close this gap by using the Spatially-Enhanced Broadband Array Spectrograph System (SEBASS) (7.6?13.5 ?m) to map PHC-impregnated soil substrates. A laboratory experiment was performed to identify the features in pure crude oil samples, in dry/wet mineral substrates, and in their physical mixtures using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and directional-hemispherical reflectance (DHR) measurements. A similar setting was designed in an open environment and imaged by the SEBASS sensor. Close-range spectroscopy indicated that PHC features between 7 and 15 ?m are subtle in comparison to the features of the mineral substrates, thus hindering direct identification of the PHC spectrally. However, the PHC coating of the grains increased the emissivity of the background features -a finding that was supported by SEBASS data processing using a matched filtering technique. The SEBASS data indicated that besides an increase in the emissivity of the underlying substrates, the presence of PHC also induces a change in the temperature of the contaminated targets. The combination of these two factors highlighted the contaminated sites indirectly. Since the mapping of clean, moist and PHC contaminated sites with TIR data depends on variations in the emissivity and temperature of the targets, the application can be extended to orbital sensors with lower spectral resolution (such as ASTER and ECO-STRESS), enabling the monitoring of larger areas.

AB Proximal and remote sensing techniques in the optical domain are cost-effective alternatives to standard soil property characterization methods. However, the extent of light penetration into the soil sample, also termed soil information depth, is not well understood. In this study a new analytical model that links the particle size distribution and soil reflectance in the near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of the electromagnetic spectrum is introduced. The model enables the partitioning of measured reflectance spectra into surface and volume (subsurface) contributions, thereby yielding insights about the soil information depth. The model simulations indicate that the surface reflectance contribution to the total reflectance is significantly higher than the volume reflectance contribution for a broad range of soils that vastly differ in texture, mineralogical composition and organic matter contents. The ratio of volume to total reflectance is higher for sandy soils than for clayey soils, especially at longer optical wavelengths, but the ratio rarely exceeds 15%. Therefore, the light reflection from dry soils is predominantly a surface phenomenon and the information depth in most soils rarely exceeds 1 mm. The results of this study reveal an intimate physical relationship between soil reflectance and the particle size distribution in the NIR/SWIR range, which opens a potential new avenue for retrieval of the particle size distribution from remotely sensed reflectance via a universal process-based approach.

TI A note on radar signatures of hydrometeors in the melting layer as

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired over the ocean often show radar signatures of rain, which are not easy to interpret. The scattering mechanisms causing radar signatures are usually attributed to surface scattering due to sea surface roughness variations caused by raindrops impinging onto the sea surface and/or by up- and downdraft winds. In this paper, we address another radar signature of rain, which is often observed in C-band (and also in X-band) SAR images, but whose origin has been a matter of debate in the ocean remote sensing community since long time and has not been solved yet. This radar signature consists of areas of very high radar backscatter (bright patches) at co- as well as well as at cross-polarization. This paper aims at providing evidence that it is not caused by surface scattering, but by volume scattering from wobbling, non-spherical, oblate hydrometeors within the melting layer. To this end, we first review the theory of radar backscattering from the melting layer as developed by D'Amico et al (1098) and then present historic radar backscatter data from the melting layer carried out by ground-based and airborne radars, which validate this theory. Then we show four representative Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired over the sea area close to Hong Kong and a SIR-C/X-SAR image acquired over the Gulf of Mexico, which show pronounced radar signatures of rain (bright patches) at co-polarization (VV) and cross-polarization (VH). The analysis of the SAR images yields the result that within the bright patches the ratio of the radar backscatter at cross-polarization to the one at co-polarization shows the same characteristics as the linear depolarization ratio (LDR) measured by radar meteorologist in radar backscattering from the melting layer. Furthermore, we show that radar signatures of rain due to volume scattering may interfere with co-polarization radar signatures of rain due to surface scattering. Thus, cross-polarization SAR images are better suited to detect radar backscattering from the melting layer than co-polarization SAR images, This investigation is of relevance for ocean surface wind retrieval using C-band SARs, since scattering at hydrometeors in the melting layer can cause significant errors in ocean wind retrieval. Areas with simultaneously high co- and cross-polarization NRCS values of around -10 dB and -20 dB, respectively, have to be flagged as areas where the conventional wind retrieval algorithm cannot be applied.

AB The optically active component of dissolved organic material in aquatic ecosystems, or colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), is represented by the coefficient of absorption due to the dissolved aquatic constituents at 440 nm, a(CDOM)(440). Remote sensing of a(CDOM)(440) enables characterization of ecosystem processes and aids in retrieval of chlorophyll a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. Spectrally adjacent band-ratio domains, e.g., blue to green, have previously been applied for remote sensing of a(CDOM)(440) in coastal and oceanic waters with similar results compared to more complex semi-analytical algorithms. Estimation of a(CDOM)(440) from ratios of the most spectrally separated ocean color wavebands (end members), e.g., ultraviolet (UV) to near-infrared (NIR), termed end-member analysis (EMA), has previously been shown to increase the accuracy of global a(CDOM)(440) retrievals from in-water observations of diffuse attenuation and to enable a unified algorithmic perspective without requiring regional adjustment of internal bio-optical parameters. EMA of above-water observations is evaluated herein, with a focus on coastal and inland waters in which increasing optical complexity and likelihood of bottom reflectance challenge the oceanic algorithms developed for deep and optically simple (case-1) waters. Analysis herein of three independent, in situ, bio-optical datasets indicates significant correlation between a(CDOM)(440) and end-member band ratios (next-generation 320 and 780 nm or legacy 412 and 670 nm ratios) with a coefficient of determination, R-2, of 0.87 (log-scale) or higher based on a dataset spanning the dynamic range of global, conservative water bodies. For applicable wavelengths, EMA algorithms are shown to agree with case-1 relationships and to produce consistent log-scale uncertainties across more than three orders of magnitude in a(CDOM)(440) values (0.001-2.305 m(-1)). EMA using UV and NIR wavelengths (320 and 780 nm) is applied to low-altitude airborne observations and satisfies 25% uncertainty based on unbiased percent differences (UPDs) within each of three dissimilar match-up sites ranging in a(CDOM)(440) from 0.02-0.57 m(-1). Results demonstrate that EMA is a useful and robust approach for the remote sensing of a(CDOM)(440) in coastal and inland waters, which are generally shallower, contain more optically complex environments, and span a greater range in a(CDOM)(440) than oceanic waters.

AB This paper proposes a simple and fast method for the identification of structural changes affecting buildings in urban environments by using a combination of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Geospatial Information System (GIS) processing.
   The identification of changes in urban settlements is of great interest for damage assessment after natural disasters, cadastral mapping and monitoring urban development or illeg.
   Satellite remote sensing is useful in this scenario and SAR data is attractive due to its wide and ubiquitous coverage, the day and night all-weather availability, the exact repetition of the acquisition geometry, the repeated illumination and the sensitivity to slight changes in the geometrical structure of the targets in the scene.
   This sensibility is an advantage, but turns into a drawback especially in an urban environment where every subtle change may cause an unwanted detection.
   This environment is indeed one of the most challenging for the detection of those changes that are of any real interest since these events are masked by thousands of irrelevant detections.
   This paper tackle this problem with a combination of an improved, high-resolution coherent change detection technique called M-CCD and with a GIS post-processing. The result is a map of changes affecting buildings that are of a significant scale and consequently of a certain interest in an urban environment.
   In this contribution, the complete workflow is detailed and an assessment of the detected changes is done with high resolution optical images through visual photo-interpretation. A comparison with other SAR and optical change detection methods is also carried out.

AB Global observations of near-surface air temperature and specific humidity over land are needed for a variety of applications, including to constrain global estimates of evapotranspiration (ET). Spaceborne hyperspectral observations, such as those from NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) mission, show promise for meeting this need, yet there are surprisingly few validation studies of AIRS near-surface atmospheric state retrievals. In this study, we use triple collocation to validate AIRS Level 3 retrievals of near-surface atmospheric state over land using twelve years of gridded station observations and two reanalyses. Deseasonalized AIRS retrievals correlate well with deseasonalized ground observations outside the tropics, but correlate less well in the tropics. Lower temporal sensitivity near the surface in the tropics contributes to the lower correlation for near-surface air temperature and is consistent with known physics of the tropical atmosphere, in which temperatures outside the boundary layer (which dominate the AIRS retrieval signal) are poorly correlated with those near the surface. Retrievals in the tropics may also be more susceptible to errors in cloud-clearing algorithms, and to uncertainty in surface emissivity. Since ET is greatest in the tropics, and tropical measurement networks are particularly sparse, this work motivates new approaches for measuring ET in the tropics.

AB NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) was installed on the International Space Station (ISS) on 10 May 2019. OCO-3 combines the flight spare spectrometer from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) mission, which has been in operation since 2014, with a new Pointing Mirror Assembly (PMA) that facilitates observations of non-nadir targets from the nadir-oriented ISS platform. The PMA is a new feature of OCO-3, which is being used to collect data in all science modes, including nadir (ND), sun-glint (GL), target (TG), and the new snapshot area mapping (SAM) mode.
   This work provides an initial assessment of the OCO-3 instrument and algorithm performance, highlighting results from the first 8 months of operations spanning August 2019 through March 2020. During the In-Orbit Checkout (IOC) phase, critical systems such as power and cooling were verified, after which the OCO-3 spectrometer and PMA were subjected to a series of rigorous tests. First light of the OCO-3 spectrometer was on 26 June 2019, with full science operations beginning on 6 August 2019. The OCO-3 spectrometer on-orbit performance is consistent with that seen during preflight testing. Signal to noise ratios are in the expected range needed for high quality retrievals of the column-averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which will be used to help quantify and constrain the global carbon cycle.
   The first public release of OCO-3 Level 2 (L2) data products, called "vEarly", is being distributed by NASA's Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). The intent of the vEarly product is to evaluate early mission performance, facilitate comparisons with OCO-2 products, and identify key areas to improve for the next data release. The vEarly XCO2 exhibits a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of similar or equal to 1, 1, 2 ppm versus a truth proxy for nadir-land, TG&SAM, and glint-water observations, respectively. The vEarly SIF shows a correlation with OCO-2 measurements of > 0.9 for highly coincident soundings. Overall, the Level 2 SIF and XCO2 products look very promising, with performance comparable to OCO-2. A follow-on version of the OCO-3 L2 product containing a number of refinements, e.g., instrument calibration, pointing accuracy, and retrieval algorithm tuning, is anticipated by early in 2021.

AB In this paper, an effective schematic is developed for estimating soil moisture (SM) from CYclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data. Here, a three-layer model of air, vegetation cover, and soil is considered. In practice, the surface reflectivity (Gamma) along with its statistics derived from the CYGNSS data and the ancillary vegetation opacity (tau) data from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) are employed. The expression for empirically retrieving SM from tau, Gamma and its corresponding statistics are determined through the linear regression technique. The CYGNSS data collected over the land surfaces within +/- 37 degrees (latitude) during the whole year of 2018 are investigated. The reference SM data are obtained from SMAP, and are regarded as ground-truth in this work. Validation and assessment are performed on the pan-tropical daily data collected throughout the annual circle at a resolution of 36 x 36 km(2). Experimental evaluation demonstrates good consistency between the SM derived from CYGNSS data and the ground-truth, with a correlation coefficient of 0.80 and a root-mean-square error of 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3). This method succeeds in providing SM estimations on a pan-tropical scale that does not rely on ongoing knowledge of SM and merely employs the least ancillary data. Furthermore, the intense temporal and spatial coverages of CYGNSS SM results are also illustrated. The use of CYGNSS SM significantly enhances the pan-tropical coverage of SMAP SM by about 22% on average. The satisfactory outcomes achieved here prove CYGNSS as an efficient complementary tool for pan-tropical SM sensing on a daily basis.

AB Aquatic vegetation is an important component in the ecosystems of wetlands and coastal waters, for example it can take up harmful substances and pollutants from the water. Constructing a remote sensing model of aquatic vegetation can deepen our understanding of the spectral characteristics and directional reflection characteristics of the aquatic vegetation canopy under various environmental conditions. However, the existing aquatic vegetation models are limited to continuously distributed canopies. This paper proposes an aquatic-vegetation-geometric-optical (AVGO) model at canopy scale for discrete aquatic vegetation. After dividing the reflectance of water background into specular components and diffuse components, the reflectances of all reflecting surfaces are classified into different reflectance components based on the differences in their materials and on whether the reflectors are illuminated by direct sunlight. Then the scene bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) is regarded as an area-weighted sum of different reflectance components. Detailed verifications were conducted to ensure that the simulation model operates as intended. The performance of the AVGO model was qualitatively validated with the WCRM model and showed the physical plausibility of the model prediction. Quantitative validations against an artificially designed experiment were consistent with the bidirectional reflectance and the nadir-viewed spectral reflectance. This model can be used for canopy modeling of discrete emergent or submerged aquatic vegetation. Potential applications include retrieval of biophysical or biochemical parameters and aquatic vegetation abundance based on hyperspectral data.

AB Droughts can cause tremendous losses to agricultural and economic development; humans have explored many anti-drought measures to mitigate the influence of drought and accordingly altering the characteristics of actual agricultural drought. In this study, a method is proposed to detect the spatiotemporal changes in drought characteristics, which show the effects of anti-drought measures on drought mitigation. Two agricultural drought mitigation evaluation indices are proposed, the agricultural drought frequency change (ADFC) and agricultural drought area change (ADAC), which are calculated by combining the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) and vegetation health index (VHI), two widely used drought monitoring indices. The PDSI and VHI represent the natural and actual agricultural drought severity under natural and actual conditions respectively, and their differences in drought frequency and affected area reflect the level of anti-drought measures in mitigating agricultural drought. The feasibility of using ADFC and ADAC to quantify the effects of anti-drought measures for agriculture is explored using data from six typical agricultural provinces in the North China Plain and Northeast China. The results show that ADFC and ADAC could reflect both the spatiotemporal changes in agricultural drought characteristics and the influence of anti-drought measures on agricultural drought. The trend of the drought mitigation index is consistent with agricultural activity statistics. These two indices could be further used to evaluate the effects of different anti-drought methods and aid in defeating agricultural drought across many countries.

TI Spatially and temporally complete Landsat reflectance time series
   modelling: The fill-and-fit approach

AB Statistical time series models are increasingly being used to fit medium resolution time series provided by satellite sensors, such as Landsat, for terrestrial monitoring. Cloud and shadows, combined with low satellite repeat cycles, reduce surface observation availability. In addition, only a single year of data can be used where there is high inter-annual variation, for example, over many croplands. These factors reduce the ability to fit time series models and reduce model fitting accuracy. In solution, we propose a novel fill-and-fit (FF) approach for application to medium resolution satellite time series. In the 'fill' step, gaps are filled using a recently published algorithm developed to fill large-area gaps in satellite time series using no other satellite data. In the 'fit' step, a linear harmonic model is fitted to the gap-filled time series. The FF approach, and the conventional harmonic model fitting without gap filling, termed the F approach, are demonstrated using seven months of Landsat-7 and -8 surface reflectance Analysis Ready Data (ARD) over agricultural regions in North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, and Kansas. Synthetic model-predicted reflectance for days through the growing season are examined, and assessed quantitatively by comparison with an independent Landsat surface reflectance data set. The six Landsat reflective band root-mean-square difference (RMSD) between the predicted and the independent reflectance, considering millions of pixel observations for each ARD tile, show that the FF approach is more accurate than the F approach. The mean FF RMSD values varied from 0.025 to 0.026 for the four tiles, whereas the mean F RMSD values varied from 0.026 to 0.047. These mean FF RMSD values are< 0.03 which is comparable to the uncertainty specification for the Landsat 8 OLI TOA reflectance, but greater than the atmospheric correction uncertainty in any Landsat 8 OLI band. The greatest RMSD values were found over the Minnesota tile and occurred due to a long period of missing data early in the growing season, and the smallest RMSD values were found for the Kansas tile because of the high availability of clear surface observations. The F approach could not be applied where there were insufficient clear surface observations to fit the model, and where the model was applied, the fitting was often sensitive to issues including gaps in the Landsat time series and the presence of undetected cloud- and shadow-contaminated observations. The FF approach could be applied to every ARD tile pixel location and the predicted reflectance was spatially-coherent and natural looking. Examples are shown that illustrate the potential of using FF predicted synthetic reflectance time series for land surface monitoring.

AB The prediction of grasslands plant diversity using satellite image time series is considered in this article. Fifteen months of freely available Sentinel optical and radar data were used to predict taxonomic and functional diversity at the pixel scale (10 m x 10 m) over a large geographical extent (40,000 km(2)). 415 field measurements were collected in 83 grasslands to train and validate several statistical learning methods. The objective was to link the satellite spectro-temporal data to the plant diversity indices. Among the several diversity indices tested, Simpson and Shannon indices were best predicted with a coefficient of determination around 0.4 using a Random Forest predictor and Sentinel-2 data. The use of Sentinel-1 data was not found to improve significantly the prediction accuracy. Using the Random Forest algorithm and the Sentinel-2 time series, the prediction of the Simpson index was performed. The resulting map highlights the intra-parcel variability and demonstrates the capacity of satellite image time series to monitor grasslands plant taxonomic diversity from an ecological viewpoint.

AB Forest aboveground biomass is a key variable in remote sensing based forest monitoring. Active sensor systems, such as lidar, can generate detailed canopy height products. Relationships between canopy height and biomass are commonly established via regression analysis using information from ground-truth plots. In this way, many site-specific height-biomass relationships have been proposed in the literature and applied for mapping in regional contexts. However, such relationships are only valid within the specific forest type for which they were calibrated. A generalized relationship would facilitate biomass estimation across forest types and regions. In this study, a combination of lidar-derived and ancillary structural descriptors is proposed as an approach for generalization between forest types. Each descriptor is supposed to quantify a different aspect of forest structure, i.e., mean canopy height, maximum canopy height, maximum stand density, vertical heterogeneity and wood density. Airborne discrete return lidar data covering 194 ha of forest inventory plots from five different sites including temperate and tropical forests from Africa, Europe, North, Central and South America was used. Biomass predictions using the best general model (nRMSE = 12.4%, R-2 = 0.74) were found to be almost as accurate as predictions using five site-specific models (nRMSE = 11.6%, R-2 = 0.78). The results further allow interpretation about the importance of the employed structure descriptors in the biomass estimation and the mechanisms behind the relationships. Understanding the relationship between canopy structure and aboveground biomass and being able to generalize it across forest types are important steps towards consistent large scale biomass mapping and monitoring using airborne and potentially also spaceborne platforms.

AB Thermal anisotropy is an important phenomenon in thermal infrared remote sensing as it restricts the retrieval accuracy of surface longwave radiation (SLR). Topography is an essential controlling factor for the directionality of SLR for high-relief regions (e.g., mountain regions) where there is land surface heterogeneity and non-isothermal properties at pixel scales. However, satellite sensors can only receive radiance from a specific surface object at a small number of simultaneous viewing angles, which makes the quantitative modeling of thermal anisotropy challenging. Therefore, we developed the topographic longwave radiation model (TLRM) to describe the directionality of SLR components taking into account the variability of both subpixel topography and thermal anisotropy in high-relief regions. The reliability of TLRM was validated using the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model over two typical geomorphic areas: a valley scene and a peak scene. The preliminary validation shows good agreement in terms of surface upward longwave radiance, which confirms the potential of TLRM for capturing the anisotropic patterns of land surfaces. The radiance values simulated by the DART model were first revised for the spectral mismatch. Then, they are used to correct residual deviation for TLRM using linear regressions. The root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) were 0.830 W/(m(2) .sr) and 0.746 for the valley scene, respectively, and 0.239 W/(m(2).sr) and 0.711 for the peak scene, respectively. Compared with TLRM, models that do not consider terrain effects generate significant discrepancies in high relief SLR components. The differences in downward longwave radiation can reach -60 W/m(2) in valleys without considering terrain effects. Based on the reference of hemispherical upward longwave radiation, surface upward longwave radiation estimated by the direct estimation method had a bias of 11.41 W/m(2) and standard deviation (STD) of 7.30 W/m(2), while the directional upward longwave radiation had a bias of 5.99 W/m(2) and STD of 4.08 W/m(2), showing lower estimation variation. The discrepancy between surface net longwave radiation (NLR) and terrain-corrected NLR ranged between 50 and -130 W/m(2) with clear negative biases mainly occurring in valleys. With higher spatial resolutions of remotely sensed imagery, the influence of complex terrain on land surface radiative flux has become more significant. This parameterization scheme is expected to better represent the topographic effects on SLR, enhance understanding of thermal anisotropy in non-isothermal mixed pixel areas of high relief, and improve the inversion accuracy of SLR.

AB Boreal forests constitute a large portion of the global forest area, yet they are undersampled through field surveys, and only a few remotely sensed data sources provide structural information wall-to-wall throughout the boreal domain. ArcticDEM is a collection of high-resolution (2 m) space-borne stereogrammetric digital surface models (DSM) covering the entire land area north of 60' of latitude. The free-availability of ArcticDEM data offers new possibilities for aboveground biomass mapping (AGB) across boreal forests, and thus it is necessary to evaluate the potential for these data to map AGB over alternative open-data sources (i.e., Sentinel-2). This study was performed over the entire land area of Norway north of 60' of latitude, and the Norwegian national forest inventory (NFI) was used as a source of field data composed of accurately geolocated field plots (n = 7710) systematically distributed across the study area. Separate random forest models were fitted using NPI data, and corresponding remotely sensed data consisting of either: i) a canopy height model (ArcticCHM) obtained by subtracting a high-quality digital terrain model (DTM) from the ArcticDEM DSM height values, ii) Sentinel-2 (S2), or iii) a combination of the two (ArcticCHM + S2).
   Furthermore, we assessed the effect of the forest- and terrain-specific factors on the models' predictive accuracy. The best model (,i.e., ArcticCHM + S2) explained nearly 60% of the variance of the training set, which translated in the largest accuracy in terms of root mean square error (RMSE = 41.4 t ha(-1)). This result highlights the synergy between 3D and multispectral data in AGB modelling.
   Furthermore, this study showed that despite the importance of ArcticCHM variables, the S2 model performed slightly better than ArcticCHM model. This finding highlights some of the limitations of ArcticDEM, which, despite the unprecedented spatial resolution, is highly heterogeneous due to the blending of multiple acquisitions across different years and seasons. We found that both forest- and terrain-specific characteristics affected the uncertainty of the ArcticCHM + S2 model and concluded that the combined use of ArcticCHM and Sentinel-2 represents a viable solution for AGB mapping across boreal forests. The synergy between the two data sources allowed for a reduction of the saturation effects typical of multispectral data while ensuring the spatial consistency in the output predictions due to the removal of artifacts and data voids present in ArcticCHM data. While the main contribution of this study is to provide the first evidence of the best-case-scenario (i.e., availability of accurate terrain models) that ArcticDEM data can provide for large-scale AGB modelling, it remains critically important for other studies to investigate how ArcticDEM may be used in areas where no DTMs are available as is the case for large portions of the boreal zone.

AB Quantifying the vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols is crucial for estimating their impact on the Earth's energy budget and climate, improving forecast of air pollution in cities, and reducing biases in the retrieval of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from space. However, to date, passive remote sensing measurements have provided limited information about aerosol extinction profiles. In this study, we propose the use of a spectral sorting approach to constrain the aerosol vertical structure using spectra of reflected sunlight absorption within the molecular oxygen (O-2) A-band collected by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated using spectra acquired over the western Sahara coast by comparing the aerosol profile retrievals with lidar measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Using a radiative transfer model to simulate OCO-2 measurements, we found that high-resolution O-2 A-band measurements have high sensitivity to aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol layer height (ALH). Retrieved estimates of AOD and ALH based on a look up table technique show good agreement with CALIPSO measurements, with correlation coefficients of 0.65 and 0.53, respectively. The strength of the proposed spectral sorting technique lies in its ability to identify spectral channels with high sensitivity to AOD and ALH and extract the associated information from the observed radiance in a straightforward manner. The proposed approach has the potential to enable future passive remote sensing missions to map the aerosol vertical distribution on a global scale.

AB Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors together provide the most widely accessible medium-to-high spatial resolution multispectral data for a wide range of applications, such as vegetation phenology identification, crop yield estimation, and forest disturbance detection. Improved timely and accurate observations of the Earth's surface and dynamics are expected from the synergistic use of Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, which entails coordinating the spatial resolution gap between Landsat (30 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 m or 20 m) images. However, widely used data fusion techniques may not fulfil community's needs for generating a temporally dense reflectance product at 10 m spatial resolution from combined Landsat and Sentinel-2 images because of their inherent algorithmic weaknesses. Inspired by the recent advances in deep learning, this study developed an extended super-resolution convolutional neural network (ESRCNN) to a data fusion framework, specifically for blending Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) data. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of the deep learning-based fusion algorithm in yielding a consistent and comparable dataset at 10 m from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Further accuracy assessments revealed that the performance of the fusion network was influenced by both the number of input auxiliary Sentinel-2 images and temporal interval (i.e., difference in image acquisition dates) between auxiliary Sentinel-2 images and the target Landsat-8 image. Compared to the benchmark algorithm, area-to-point regression kriging (ATKPK), the deep learning-based fusion framework proved better in the quantitative assessment in terms of RMSE (root mean square error), correlation coefficient (CC), universal image quality index (UIQI), relative global-dimensional synthesis error (ERGAS), and spectral angle mapper (SAM). ESRCNN better preserved the reflectance distribution as the original image compared to ATPRK, resulting in an improved image quality. Overall, the developed data fusion network that blends Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images has the potential to help generate continuous reflectance observations of higher temporal frequency than that can be obtained from a single Landsat-like sensor.

AB The most recent efforts to provide remote sensing (RS) estimates of plant function rely on the combination of Radiative Transfer Models (RTM) and Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) models, such as the Soil-Canopy Observation Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model. In this work we used ground spectro-radiometric and chamber-based CO2 flux measurements in a nutrient manipulated Mediterranean grassland in order to: 1) develop a multiple-constraint inversion approach of SCOPE able to retrieve vegetation biochemical, structural as well as key functional traits, such as chlorophyll concentration (C-ab), leaf area index (LAI), maximum carboxylation rate (V-cmax) and the Ball-Berry sensitivity parameter (m); and 2) compare the potential of the of gross primary production (GPP) and sun-induced fluorescence (SIF), together with up-welling Thermal Infrared (TIR) radiance and optical reflectance factors (RF), to estimate such parameters. The performance of the proposed inversion method as well as of the different sets of constraints was assessed with contemporary measurements of water and heat fluxes and leaf nitrogen content, using pattern-oriented model evaluation.
   The multiple-constraint inversion approach proposed together with the combination of optical RF and diel GPP and TIR data provided reliable estimates of parameters, and improved predicted water and heat fluxes. The addition of SIF to this scheme slightly improved the estimation of m. Parameter estimates were coherent with the variability imposed by the fertilization and the seasonality of the grassland. Results revealed that fertilization had an impact on V-cmax while no significant differences were found for m. The combination of RF, SIF and die] TIR data weakly constrained functional traits. Approaches not including GPP failed to estimate LAI; however GPP overestimated C-ab, in the dry period. These problems might be related to the presence of high fractions of senescent leaves in the grassland. The proposed inversion approach together with pattern-oriented model evaluation open new perspectives for the retrieval of plant functional traits relevant for land surface models, and can be utilized at various research sites where hyperspectral remote sensing imagery and eddy covariance flux measurements are simultaneously taken.

AB Woody vegetation is a central component of savanna ecosystems providing ecosystem services for local livelihoods. Accurate monitoring of woody vegetation in savannas is therefore desirable, yet large scale mapping approaches rely on relatively coarse spatial resolution satellite data, which cannot directly capture the scattered nature of savanna trees. Studies at regional scale thus estimate the fractional cover of woody plants for a given area, whereas binary tree/no-tree estimates are restricted to the use of very high-resolution (VHR) images at local scales. With the launch of the Sentinel satellite systems (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), the spatial resolution of images approaches the size of medium/large tree crowns, providing the opportunity to map the presence/absence of tree canopies, rather than the fraction of woody cover or forested areas. Here, we used a support vector machine (SVM) to classify the presence/absence of woody canopies from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data at a 10-m spatial resolution for the entire African Sahel. Training samples for the SVM classifier were collected from VHR images provided by Google Earth and Sentinel satellite data were processed in Google Earth Engine. Accuracy assessment was performed based on independent VHR images, showing an overall accuracy of 93% (71% and 98% for producer's accuracy of woody and non-woody pixels, 91% and 93% for user's accuracy of woody and non-woody pixels) when combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data (overall accuracy of 89% using Sentinel-1 only and 91% using Sentinel-2 only). The combined use proved to perform significantly better (p < 0.05) than the single use of any of the two. A comparison with existing tree cover maps (by aggregating presence/absence of tree canopies into fractional cover) showed noticeable differences, reflecting the need for new woody cover products adapted to the nature of savanna ecosystems. The Sentinel woody canopy map was able to reproduce the general pattern of scattered woody canopies, but generally overestimated the woody coverage (11.37 26.13% (mean sd) when aggregating to 250 m resolution) due to the 10 x 10-m spatial resolution which exceeds the crown size of a typical savanna tree. The cloud-based Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 analysis presented is a step towards large scale mapping of woody canopy (tree/no-tree) in savannas. Ultimately, such direct assessment of woody canopy areas will allow monitoring of temporal dynamics of woody canopies in future studies as Sentinel time-series expands to multiple years.

AB Sea surface temperature (SST) is one of the most important parameters in the global ocean-atmospheric system, changes of which can have profound effects on the global climate and may lead to extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. Therefore, predicting the dynamics of future SSTs is of vital importance which can help identify these extreme events and alleviate the losses they cause. In this paper, a machine learning method combining the long short-term memory (LSTM) deep recurrent neural network model and the AdaBoost ensemble learning model (LSTM-AdaBoost) is proposed to predict the short and mid-term daily SST considering that LSTM is good at modelling long-term dependencies but suffers from overfitting, while AdaBoost has strong prediction capability and is not easily overfitted. By combining these two strong and heterogeneous models, the prediction errors related to variance may cancel out each other and the final results can be improved. In this method, the historical time-series satellite data of SST anomaly (SSTA) is used instead of SST itself considering that the fluctuations of SSTs are very small compared to their absolute magnitudes. The seasonality of the SSTA time series is first modelled using polynomial regression and then removed. Then, the deseasonalized time series are used to train the developed LSTM model and AdaBoost model independently. Daily SSTA predictions are made using these two models, and eventually, their predictions are combined as final predictions using the averaging strategy. A case study in the East China Sea that predicts the daily SSTA 10?days ahead shows that the proposed LSTM-AdaBoost combination model outperforms the LSTM and AdaBoost separately, as well as the optimized support vector regression (SVR) model, the optimized feedforward backpropagation neural network model (BPNN), and the stacking LSTM-AdaBoost model (S_LSTM-AdaBoost), when judged using multiple error statistics and from different perspectives. The results suggest that the LSTM-AdaBoost combination model using the averaging strategy is highly promising for short and mid-term daily SST predictions.

AB This study proposes a new technique involving texture-based image classification to categorize altitudinal FTEs by the degree of fragmentation of the interface. This allows a) universally adaptable altitudinal FTE categorization based on widely available satellite data products and b) assessment of sensitivity of altitudinal FTEs to shift with climate change at different locations based on the spatial distribution of the corresponding categories. The FTE categorization scheme used in this study corresponds partly to the globally occurring primary altitudinal FTE 'forms.' Specifically, 'diffuse' and 'abrupt' FTEs are recognized and separated. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from Sentinel-2 imagery is used for FTE delineation and categorization. A technique named FOurier-based Textural Ordination (FOTO) is implemented to extract textural information based on NDVI variations in image windows, and supervised classification is used to further separate these windows into FTE categories based on texture. The analysis is conducted on part of the Khibiny Mountains, Kola Peninsula, Russia, and further tested on six other study areas spread across the circumarctic region. The proposed method is able to adapt to different study areas with minimum changes in parameterization, and effectively extract altitudinal FTEs and categorize them into different FTE forms with satisfactory accuracies.

AB Photosynthetic capacity is often quantified by the Rubisco-limited photosynthetic capacity (i.e. maximum carboxylation rate, V-cmax). It is a key plant functional trait that is widely used in Earth System Models for simulation of the global carbon and water cycles. Measuring V-cmax is time-consuming and laborious; therefore, the spatiotemporal distribution of V-cmax is still poorly understood due to limited measurements of V-cmax. In this study, we used a data assimilation approach to map the spatial variation of V-cmax for global terrestrial ecosystems from a 11-year-long satellite-observed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) record. In this SIF-derived V-cmax map, the mean V-cmax value for each plant function type (PFT) is found to be comparable to a widely used N-derived V-cmax dataset by Kattge et al. (2009). The gradient of V-cmax along PFTs is clearly revealed even without land cover information as an input. Large seasonal and spatial variations of V-cmax are found within each PFT, especially for diverse crop rotation systems. The distribution of major crop belts, characterized with high V-cmax values, is highlighted in this V-cmax map. Legume plants are characterized with high V-cmax values. This V-cmax map also clearly illustrates the emerging soybean revolution in South America where V-cmax is the highest among the world. The gradient of V-cmax in Amazon is found to follow the transition of soil types with different soil N and P contents. This study suggests that satellite-observed SIF is powerful in deriving the important plant functional trait, i.e. V-cmax, for global climate change studies.

AB Accurate bathymetric mapping of shallow waters (above 15 m) is essential for a wide range of scientific research, government, transport, and industry globally. Satellite-based bathymetry estimation approaches offer an alternative to traditional shipborne measurements, especially given advancements in their spatial and temporal resolution of satellite imagery, including the new Planet Dove constellation of > 150 satellites providing daily coastal coverage. Dove satellites provide abundant cloud-free images even over cloudy tropical coastal environment, offering an opportunity to generate frequent bathymetry maps at high spatial resolution (4 m). We developed a new adaptive bathymetry estimation algorithm for Planet Dove and similar satellites. The algorithm adaptively tunes a depth estimator according to water column attenuation conditions. The algorithm was tested at five diverse reef sites globally (Lighthouse Reef, Belize; Saona Island, Dominican Republic; St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; Heron Island, Australia; Hawaii Island, U.S.) using 31 satellite images from six Dove satellites. Derived water depth was validated (RMSE = 1.22 to 1.86 m) with field-measured sampling points (61,025) ranging in depth from 1 to 15 m. Algorithm performance was best at depths of 4-10 m. This new adaptive algorithm can be effectively applied to derive high spatial resolution bathymetric maps from Planet Dove satellite imagery across a wide range of conditions.

AB This article shows the capacity do derive depth using the sub metric Pleiades satellite mission (Airbus/CNES) in persistent mode, which allows acquiring a sequence of images (12 images) at a regional scale (similar to 100 km(2)). To derive depths, a spatiotemporal cross-correlation method for estimating wave velocity and inverse bathymetry is presented and applied to the 12-image sequence. A good agreement is found with in-situ bathymetry measurements obtained during the COMBI 2017 Capbreton experiment (correlation of 0.8, RMSE = 1.4 m). Depth estimate saturation is found for depths > 35 m, mainly in a deep canyon just off the coast located in front of the entrance to Capbreton harbour. The image sequence is used to study the sensitivity of the number of images. The results show that the accuracy increases with the number of images in the sequence and with a fine resolution. Despite their noisy nature, newly available time-updated satellite bathymetries can be used to understand coastal evolution at several scales and improve risk mitigation strategies through modelling.

AB Accurate dynamic measurements of snow depth (SD) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are of great importance for understanding local climate systems and surface hydrological cycles. Currently, passive microwave remote sensing is the most effective approach used to monitor the spatiotemporal variations in SD. However, the large uncertainties and low spatial resolution of existing SD products lead to less satisfactory passive microwave remote sensing in regions with complex terrain conditions, strong seasonal transitions and great spatiotemporal heterogeneity, such as the TP. In this study, geographic location, terrain, snow cover days and brightness temperature were evaluated. Then, critical factors were used to develop an Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SD downscaling model. The results indicated the following: (1) SD is greatly influenced by geographic location, snow covered days, terrain parameters and brightness temperature difference. The surface roughness exhibited the best correlations with ground observations, which reflects 44% of the variation in SD; (2) the novel multifactor power SD downscaling model, which combines AMSR2 brightness temperature data and other auxiliary data, showed higher accuracy and stability and was closely correlated with the SD ground observations, and it reflected 80% of the SD variation; (3) compared with the AMSR2 ascending and descending orbital SD products released by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the SD datasets in China from the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China (WESTDC), the proposed downscaled SD datasets for the TP were greatly improved, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and average absolute error (MAE) were greatly reduced (2.00 cm and 0.25 cm, respectively); (4) the downscaled SD datasets for the TP showed good accuracy (RMSE = 0.58 cm) in areas with a SD of < 3 cm; and (5) the worst monitoring accuracy of the downscaled SD product was for grasslands, with a RMSE of 2.07 cm. The best accuracy of the downscaling SD product was found for bare land cover conditions, with an RMSE of only 0.41 cm.

AB Accurate quantification of the distribution and characteristics of frozen soil is critical for evaluating the impacts of climate change on the ecological and hydrological systems in high-latitude and-altitude regions, such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, field observations have been limited by the harsh climate and complex terrain on the plateau, which greatly restricts our ability to predict the existence of and variations in frozen soils, especially at the regional scale. Here, we present a study relying solely on satellite data to drive process-based simulation of soil freeze-thaw processes. Modifications are made to an existing process-based model (Geomorphology-Based Eco-Hydrological Model, GBEHM) such that the model is fully adaptable to remote sensing inputs. The developed model fed with a combination of MODIS, TRMM and AIRX3STD satellite products is applied in the upper Yellow River Basin (coverage of similar to 2.54 x 10(5) km(2)) in the northeast TP and validated against field observations of freezing and thawing front depths (D-ft) and soil temperature (T-soil) at 54 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations, as well as frozen-ground types at 22 boreholes. Results indicate that the developed model performs reasonably well in simulating D-ft (R-2 = 0.69; mean bias = -0.03 m) and T-soil (station averaged R-2 and mean bias range between 0.90-0.96 and -0.51 similar to -0.14 degrees C at eight observational depths, respectively), and outperforms the original GBEHM forced with ground-measured meteorological variables. The frozen-ground types are also (in general) accurately identified by the satellite-based approach, except for a few permafrost boreholes located near the permafrost boundary regions. Additionally, we also demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic soil water content in frozen soil simulation: We find that a static-soil-moisture assumption (as used in previous studies) would lead to biased soil temperature estimates by > 0.5 degrees C. Our study demonstrates the value of using satellite data in frozen-soil simulation over complex landscapes, potentially leading to a greater understanding of soil freeze-thaw processes at the regional scale.

AB Photosynthesis is essential for life on earth as it, inter alia, influences the composition of the atmosphere and is the driving mechanism of primary production. Photosynthesis is particularly controlled by leaf pigments such as chlorophyll, carotenoids or anthocyanins. Incoming solar radiation is mainly captured by chlorophyll, whereas plant organs are also protected from excess radiation by carotenoids and anthocyanins. Current and upcoming optical earth observation sensors are sensitive to these radiative processes and thus feature a high potential for mapping the spatial and temporal variation of these photosynthetic pigments. In the context of remote sensing, leaf pigments are either quantified as leaf area-based content [mu g/cm(2)] or as leaf mass-based concentration [g/g or %]. However, these two metrics are fundamentally different, and until now there has been neither an in-depth discussion nor a consensus on which metric to choose. This is notable considering the amount of studies that do not explicitly differentiate between pigment content and concentration. We therefore seek to outline the differences between both metrics and thus show that the remote sensing of leaf pigment concentration [%] is unsubstantial. This is due to the fact that, firstly, pigment concentration is likely to primarily reflect variation in leaf mass per area and not pigments itself. Second, the radiative transfer in plant leaves is especially determined by the absolute content of pigments in a leaf and not its relative concentration to other leaf constituents. And third, as a ratio, pigment concentration is an ambiguous metric, which further complicates the quantification of leaf pigments at the canopy scale. Given these issues related to the use of chlorophyll concentration, we thus conclude that remote sensing of leaf pigments should be primarily performed on an area basis [mu g/cm(2)].

AB Prescribed burning is a technique commonly applied to reduce fire risk. Fire is introduced under specific environmental conditions, with explicit duration, intensity and rate of spread. Such conditions deviate from those encountered during the fire season. As a result, prescribed burns mostly affect surface fuels and understorey vegetation, an outcome markedly different when compared to wildfires.
   Information on prescribed burning outcomes is important for evaluating the extent to which land management objectives have been achieved. This study focused on the ability of Radar Burn Ratio (RBR), a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based multi-temporal index, to appraise the outcome of prescribed burns in eucalypt forests of Western Australia. L-band datasets acquired by the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2) sensor were used to relate changes in radar backscatter coefficient with the effects of prescribed burning. Two modelling approaches based on post- to pre-fire ratios were used to evaluate prescribed burn impacts. Post-fire tree survival in areas affected by high fire impacts was inferred by assessing the recovery rates of the backscatter coefficient for the first year after the burn.
   The impact of prescribed burns was estimated with relatively high overall accuracy (79%) using cross-polarized backscatter (HV) under dry conditions. The HH polarization and the Normalized Difference Backscatter Intensity (NDBI) showed certain ability to detect burned areas under wet conditions. The results suggest that L-band backscatter coefficient may contribute to evaluating the success of prescribed burns in Western Australian eucalypt forests through its sensitivity to changes in vegetation structure. In addition, tree survival (as opposed to mortality) and recovery towards the pre-fire state might be inferred by analysing short-term post-fire trends of the backscatter coefficient in areas affected by high fire impacts.

AB Wildfires are a major natural hazard, causing substantial damage to infrastructure as well as being a risk to lives and homes. An understanding of their progression and behaviour is necessary to reduce risks and to develop operational management strategies in the event of an active fire. Many empirical fire-spread models have been developed to predict the spread and overall behaviour of a wildfire, based on a range of parameters such as weather and fuel conditions. However, these parameters may not be available with sufficient accuracy or spatiotemporal resolution to provide reliable fire spread predictions. Fuel condition data include variables such as vegetation quantity, structure and moisture content and, in the event of previous wildfires, the burn severity and stage of ecosystem recovery. In this study, an index called the Vegetation Structure Perpendicular Index (VSPI) is introduced. The VSPI utilises the short-wave infrared reflectance in bands centred at 1.6 and 2.2 pm, essentially representing the amount and structure of the vegetation's woody biomass (as opposed to the photosynthetic activity and moisture content). The VSPI is quantified as the divergence from a linear regression between the two bands in a time series and represents vegetation disturbance and recovery more reliably than indices such as the Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR) and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The VSPI index generally shows minor inter-annual variability and stronger post-wildfire detection of disturbance over a longer period than NBR and NDVI. The index is developed and applied to major wildfire events within eucalypt forests throughout southern Australia to estimate both burn severity and time to recovery. The VSPI can provide an improved information layer for fire risk evaluation and operational predictions of wildfire behaviour.

AB Disturbance and regrowth are vital processes in determining the roles of forest ecosystem in the carbon and biogeochemical cycles. Using time series observations, the vegetation change tracker (VCT) algorithm was designed to map the location, timing, and spectral magnitudes of forest disturbance events. While these spectral disturbance magnitudes are indicative of physical changes in tree cover or biomass, their quantitative relationships have yet to be established. This study focuses on estimating disturbance intensity as measured by percent basal area removal using spectral indices from the VCT algorithm over North and South Carolina. Repeat measurements on Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) ground plots, which provide changes in basal area between multiple dates at precise locations, are used for training and validation of the model. The overall R-2 between predicted disturbance intensity and reference data is 0.66, and cross-validation prediction uncertainty is 14% in North Carolina. Possible causes of this uncertainty could be site heterogeneity and the temporal offset between ground measurements and satellite observations. Results show the area of stand clearing disturbances remains relatively stable around 1143 km(2) yr(-1) in North and South Carolina throughout the period of observations (1985-2015). The average amount of forest area affected by partial disturbance is much higher at 3287 km(2) yr The area of partial disturbances has strong inter-annual variability with a high value of 6000 km(2) in 2007 and a low value of 1919 km(2) in 2013.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) plays a key role in connecting land surface energy and water exchanges with near-surface atmosphere. However, the spatial distribution of LST over mountainous areas is not only strongly affected by the differences in surface thermal properties but also by the differences in thermal or radiative environment induced by the topographic variations, presenting significant terrain effect. This effect greatly hinders researches on surface energy fluxes and soil moisture estimation in these regions. To normalize the terrain effect, a random forest (RF)-based normalization approach was developed in this study and applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data over a typical mountain region in the eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau, China. An LST linking model was first constructed to express the complicated interrelationship between LST and other surface variables, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index (LAI), surface albedo (ALB), cumulative incident solar radiation (CSR), normalized difference water index (NDWI), surface elevation (ELV), and surface slope (SLP). The estimation results well indicated the good accuracy of the model with the coefficient of determination (R-2) above 0.92 for 90 selected days in 2015. Based on the good LST linking model, the LST normalization was achieved by replacing the topography affected factors (CSR, ELV, and SLP) with reference values for each pixel when keeping the rest status factors as their original values. The normalization result was indirectly validated by the normalization results with the traditional method based on the linear correction upon the regression between surface elevation and LST. The cross-validation clearly indicated the proposed method had an obvious advantage in reducing the topography-induced LST difference based on the average decrease in the temperature range (9.51 K) and the standard deviation (1.09 K) for the images on the 90 selected days over the study area. In contrast, the traditional method was hard to capture the terrain effect only based on the relationship between LST and surface elevation due to the complex interaction between LST and other factors. Overall, the proposed method shows a good application potential for normalizing the terrain effect on LST, and the results will be helpful for the LST-based estimation of surface energy fluxes or soil moisture over mountainous areas.

AB With growing concern about the impacts of fires on ecosystems and economies, satellite products are increasingly being used to understand fire regimes. Concurrently, where available, agency records of fires have also been used to assess fire regimes. Yet, it remains unclear if these independent datasets measure the same fires, which raises concerns about the interpretation and benchmarking of models derived from these products. Here, we present a novel product intercomparison of the MODIS burned area and active fire products across the conterminous United States using nearly 250,000 agency reported wildfires as reference data to model consistencies and inconsistencies between all three datasets. We compared agency reported wildfires from the Fire Program Analysis fire occurrence database to the MODIS products to identify which fires were detected vs. omitted by MODIS products relative to agency fire records, and by agency fire records relative to MODIS. We created generalized linear models as a function of fire attributes (e.g. size) and environmental variables (e.g. cloud cover) to predict MODIS detection of agency wildfires, and anthropogenic variables (e.g. agriculture) to predict agency detection of MODIS fires. We modeled fire detection probability separately for MODIS burned area and active fire products, and for the eastern and western U.S. Overall, we found that MODIS product detection rates ranged from 3.5% to 23.4% of all documented agency wildfires > 1 ha, and that likelihood of detection increased with fire size. Agency detection rates ranged from 23.5% to 48% of MODIS burned area and active fires. Under ideal conditions, the MODIS active fire product had a 50% probability of detecting a wildfire that grew to at least 10 ha (eastern U.S.) 78 ha (western U.S.), while the burned area product had a 50% probability of detecting a wildfire that grew to at least 169 ha (eastern U.S.) 234 ha (western U.S.). Cloud cover and leaf area index were significant predictors of MODIS fire detection, while state boundaries were significant predictors of agency fire detection. This analysis presents an important assessment of the fire attributes and ground conditions that influence MODIS fire detection relative to extensive and increasingly used ground-based wildfire records. The large discrepancy in records of fire occurrence between MODIS and agency fire datasets highlights the need for this type of analysis into the types of fires likely to be included in each database.

AB Exposure estimation of fine particulate matter with diameter < 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) at high spatiotemporal resolution is crucial to epidemiological studies that examine acute or sub-chronic health outcomes of PM2.5. However, exposure assessment of PM2.5 has been negatively affected by sparsely distributed monitoring stations. In addition, several limitations exist among the existing methods for high spatiotemporal resolution PM2.5 estimation, including ignorance or limited use of spatial autocorrelation, single-model methods, and use of aerosol optical depth data with non-random missingness. These limitations probably introduce bias or high uncertainty in model estimation. In this paper, we proposed an approach of constrained mixed-effect bagging models to leverage advanced algorithm of the high-resolution AOD retrieved by Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC), with other spatiotemporal predictors and spatial autocorrelation to reliably estimate PM2.5 at a high spatiotemporal resolution. Our base model was a daily mixed-effect spatial model that accounted for spatial autocorrelation using embedded structured and unstructured spatial random effects. Point estimates from the base models were then averaged based on the bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to reduce variance in prediction. Then, constrained optimization was developed to minimize the impact of missing AOD and to capture a full time-series of PM2.5 concentration. Our daily-level bagging allowed AOD-PM2.5 association and spatial autocorrelation to vary daily, which substantially improved the model performance. As a case study of daily PM2.5 predictions in 2014 in Shandong Province, China, our approach achieved R-2 of 0.87 (RMSE: 18.6 mu g/m(3)) in cross validation, and R-2 of 0.75 (RMSE: 20.6 mu g/m(3)) in an independent test, similar to or better than most existing methods. We further extended the 2014 models to simulate 2014-2016 full time-series of biweekly average PM2.5 concentrations with no use of covariates in 2015-2016 but constrained optimization over 2014 daily point estimates; the results showed well-captured temporal trend with a total correlation of 0.81 between the simulated and observed values from 2015 to 2016. Our approach can be applied for other regions for exposure estimation of PM2.5 when measurements alone are not able to capture the desirable spatial and temporal resolutions.

Satellite derived pre- and post-fire differenced severity indices (Delta FSI), such as the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (Delta NBR), are widely used to map the severity of large wildfires. Fire severity classification is commonly undertaken through the identification of severity class thresholds in Delta FSI. However, several shortcomings have been identified with severity classifications using Delta FSI, including poor delineation of low fire severity classes, and unsatisfactory performance when Delta FSI classification thresholds are applied to new landscapes. Our study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. We collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using Delta NBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Results of the bootstrapping validation show that the RF classifier had very high classification accuracy ( > 95%) for unburnt (UB), crown scorch (CS) and crown consumption (CC) severity classes, and high classification accuracy ( > 74%) for low severity classes (crown unburnt, CU; partial crown scorch, PCS). The RF classification outperformed the Delta NBR classification for all severity classes, increasing classification accuracy by between 6%-21%. Cross validation using independent fires produced similar median classification accuracy as the bootstrapping validation, though the RF classification of CU was substantially reduced to similar to 55%. Delta NBR, Delta NDWI and Delta NDVI were the three most important variables in the RF model. The Landsat satellite platform used to derive the indices had little effect on classification accuracy. Maps produced using the RF classifier in GEE had similar spatial patterns in fire severity classes as maps produced using time-consuming hand digitisation of aerial images. GEE was found to be a highly efficient platform for image acquisition, processing and production of severity maps. Our study shows that fire severity mapping using RF classifiers provides a robust method for broad scale mapping of fire severity across heterogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the GEE-based classification framework supports the operational application of this approach in a land management agency context for the rapid production of fire severity maps.

AB Using in situ data of spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)) collected over North American oceanic, coastal and estuarine waters between 2002 and 2016 (N = 942), we evaluate two atmospheric correction approaches applied to MODIS measurements. One is the POLYnomial based approach originally designed for MERIS (POLYMER) but adopted and implemented for MODIS, and the other is the traditional Gordon and Wang (1994b) near-infrared (NIR) approach with iteration to account for non-negligible NIR water-leaving radiance, which is currently embedded in the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) software package and used operationally by NASA for processing MODIS data (termed as NASA standard atmospheric correction or NSAC). The approaches are evaluated for both quality and quantity of their retrieved R-rs in the visible domain. The quality is gauged through three statistical measures between in situ and MODIS-retrieved R-rs: root mean square error (RMSE, sr(-1)), unbiased root mean square (uRMS), and mean bias (delta, sr(-1)). For common points where both approaches yield valid R-rs retrievals, POLYMER shows worse performance than NSAC for blue bands (< 488 nm) and comparable performance for green and red bands. However, POLYMER shows the ability to retrieve more valid R-rs data points (2-3 folds) than NSAC for this evaluation dataset primarily because the latter fails over strong sun glint regions where the MODIS NIR bands saturate but the former is designed to work over sun glint regions using non-saturation MODIS bands. For those data points where only POLYMER yield valid R-rs retrievals, data quality is slightly worse than from the common data points. Although these results may vary slightly among individual subregions, it is generally true that POLYMER may be used as a surrogate of NSAC for atmospheric correction of MODIS when data quantity is significantly limited due to perturbations of sun glint and thin clouds that are typical for subtropical and tropical regions.

AB Recent advancement in the understanding of snow-microwave interactions has helped to isolate the considerable potential for radar-based retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE). There are however, few datasets available to address spatial uncertainties, such as the influence of snow microstructure, at scales relevant to space-borne application. In this study we introduce measurements from SnowSAR, an airborne, dual-frequency (9.6 and 17.2 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR), to evaluate high resolution (10 m) backscatter within a snow-covered tundra basin. Coincident in situ surveys at two sites characterize a generally thin snowpack (50 cm) interspersed with deeper drift features. Structure of the snowpack is found to be predominantly wind slab (65%) with smaller proportions of depth hoar underlain (35%). Objective estimates of snow microstructure (exponential correlation length; l(ex)), show the slab layers to be 2.8 times smaller than the basal depth hoar. In situ measurements are used to parametrize the Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (MEMLS3&a) and compare against collocated SnowSAR backscatter. The evaluation shows a scaling factor (phi) between 1.37 and 1.08, when applied to input of l(ex), minimizes MEMLS root mean squared error to < 1.1 dB. Model sensitivity experiments demonstrate contrasting contributions from wind slab and depth hoar components, where wind rounded microstructures are identified as a strong control on observed backscatter. Weak sensitivity of SnowSAR to spatial variations in SWE is explained by the smaller contributing microstructures of the wind slab.

AB We developed an approach to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) through interpolation of spatially representative point measurements using a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and historical spatial SWE data. It accurately reproduced measured SWE, using different data sources for training and evaluation. In the central-Sierra American River basin, we used a k-NN algorithm to interpolate data from continuous snow-depth measurements in 10 sensor clusters by fusing them with 14 years of daily 500-m resolution SWE-reconstruction maps. Accurate SWE estimation over the melt season shows the potential for providing daily, near real-time distributed snowmelt estimates. Further south, in the Merced-Tuolumne basins, we evaluated the potential of k-NN approach to improve real-time SWE estimates. Lacking dense ground-measurement networks, we simulated k-NN interpolation of sensor data using selected pixels of a bi-weekly Lidar-derived snow water equivalent product. k-NN extrapolations underestimate the Lidar-derived SWE, with a maximum bias of -10 cm at elevations below 3000 m and +15 cm above 3000 m. This bias was reduced by using a Gaussian-process regression model to spatially distribute residuals. Using as few as 10 scenes of Lidar-derived SWE from 2014 as training data in the k-NN to estimate the 2016 spatial SWE, both RMSEs and MAEs were reduced from around 20-25 cm to 10-15 cm comparing to using SWE reconstructions as training data. We found that the spatial accuracy of the historical data is more important for learning the spatial distribution of SWE than the number of historical scenes available. Blending continuous spatially representative ground-based sensors with a historical library of SWE reconstructions over the same basin can provide real-time spatial SWE maps that accurately represents Lidar-measured snow depth; and the estimates can be improved by using historical Lidar scans instead of SWE reconstructions.

AB This paper describes the methodology for deriving yearly pixel-wise snow melt-off day maps from optical data based FSC (Fractional Snow Cover) without conducting any interpolation for cloud-obscured pixels or otherwise missing data. The Copernicus CryoLand Pan-European FSC time series for 2001-2016 re-gridded to 0.1 degrees serves as input for the production of 16 years of melt-off day maps for Europe. These maps are compared with passive microwave radiometer (MWR) melt retrievals, to compare the performance of these two independent datasets, particularly concerning the effect of physiographic and snow conditions on the accuracy of the melt-off day estimates. Both these datasets are evaluated against melt-off day derived from in situ snow depth (SD) time series observed at European weather stations. We also present the relationship of these snow melt-off day products to a passive microwave radiometer-derived landscape freeze/thaw product.
   Our results show that the melt-off day derived from optical springtime FSC time series provides the strongest correlation with the snow melt-off day with respect to the in situ data. Overall the deviation of CryoLand FSC data derived melt-off day to that indicated by in situ observations is quite small, with positive bias of 0.9 days, and RMSE of 13.1 days. For 85% of the analyzed cases the differences are between 10 days. Across Europe the MWR-based detection of melt-off day is less accurate; the investigated method performs the best for areas with sustained seasonal snow cover. Based on the time series for MWR-based melt-off day (1980-2016) and FT-ESDR (1980-2014), separately for boreal forests and tundra, we also found a clear trend towards earlier snow clearance: a decrease of melt-off day by as much as 5 days per decade in boreal forest region was observed.

AB Water flow patterns across coastal and deltaic wetlands affect biogeochemical cycling, denitrification, organic carbon burial, and coastal landscape evolution. Our understanding of such patterns across these important landscapes is incomplete, however, because of the inherent difficulty of conducting spatially and temporally dense ground- or boat-based surveys in shallow, vegetated terrain. We conducted an airborne L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisition campaign on Wax Lake Delta, Louisiana, USA, in May 2015, to investigate whether water velocities and flow patterns over kilometer scales can be determined from remote sensing. Thirteen SAR flight lines over the delta region were acquired in 3 h with six different flight directions, concurrently with a small boat campaign. We show that SAR azimuth displacement due to Doppler shift can be used to estimate the surface water flow relative to the static and submerged vegetation interspersed on delta islands, using a simple Bragg wave scattering model and accounting for the Bragg wave's free velocity and wind drift. At Wax Lake Delta, we find that similar to 0.40 m/s water velocities within the main deltaic channels slow to 0.1-0.2 m/s as flow spreads laterally across, and converges within, the vegetated islands, coinciding with shallow (< 0.5 m) depths and heightened flow resistance. This SAR-based technique opens up new avenues for understanding shallow submerged, vegetated coastal wetlands and deltas.

AB Climate change is currently altering temperature and precipitation totals and timing in Arctic regions. Moss communities constitute much of the understory in Arctic vegetation, and as poikilohydric plants moss are highly sensitive to timing and duration of moisture levels. Here we investigate the role of moisture content on NDVI, red and near-infrared reflectance, and gross primary productivity (GPP) of two sphagnum and two pleurocarpus moss community types during two separate drying experiments. For both experiments, blocks of moss were collected near Imnavait Creek, Alaska, saturated to full water capacity, and then allowed to air dry before being re-saturated. Drying of blocks was conducted in a translucent outdoor tent during the first experiment and under indoor climate-controlled conditions during the second. Community NDVI (experiment 1 and 2), and GPP (experiment 2) were measured at regular intervals during the dry-down and after rewetting. In both experiments, moss NDVI sharply declined between 80% and 70% moisture content for sphagnum moss communities (NDVI change = -0.17 to -0.2), but less so for pleurocarpus moss communities (NDVI change = -0.06 to -0.12). Changes in NDVI were largely the result of increases in reflectance in red wavelengths. Peak GPP for all community types in the second experiment (1.31 to 2.08 mu mo] m(-2)s(-1)) occurred at 80% moisture content and declined significantly as moisture content decreased. Rates of GPP continued to decline below 80% moisture content until near zero as moss reached a steady weight (air dry) over a period of 84 h, while NDVI values declined slowly between 70% hydration and fully air dry. Re-saturation caused NDVI to increase in both sphagnum (NDVI change = + 0.18 to + 0.23) and pleurocarpus (NDVI change = + 0.10 to + 0.17) communities. Only sphagnum communities showed GPP resuming (0.824 mu mol m(-2)s(-1)) after 24 h. The strong changes in NDVI and mismatch of moss NDVI values and GPP with moisture content fluctuations indicate that using NDVI as a proxy for productivity in Arctic vegetation communities may be problematic and underscores the need for quantification of moss community coverage, composition, and moisture content.

AB Plant functional traits (PFTs) underpin ecosystem processes and therefore ecosystem service provision. If PFTs are possible to detect and discriminate spectrally, then it may be possible to use remote sensing applications to map ecosystem processes or services within and across landscapes. As a first step towards this application, we explored whether functional groups of 22 dominant South African wetland species were spectrally separable based on their PFTs. We measured 23 biochemical and morphological PFTs in combination with spectra from 350 to 2349 nm using a handheld radiometer. First, we evaluated the possibility of accurately predicting morphological and biochemical PFTs from reflectance spectra using three approaches: spectrum averaging, redundancy analysis (RDA), and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Second, we established whether functional groups and species were spectrally distinguishable. We found seven PFTs to be important in at least two of the three approaches: four morphological and three biochemicals. Morphological traits that were important were leaf area (PISA: r(2) = 0.40, regression: r(2) = 0.41), specific leaf area (r(2) = 0.67), leaf mass (r(2) = 0.43, r(2) = 0.38), and leaf length/width ratio (r(2) = 0.62). Biochemical traits that play a role in the structural composition of vegetation, like lignin content (r(2) = 0.98, r(2) = 0.54), concentration (r(2) = 0.45) and cellulose content (r(2) = 0.57, r(2) = 0.49), were found to be important by at least two of the analyses. Three other traits were important in at least one of the analyses: total biomass (r(2) = 0.56), leaf C/N ratio (r(2) = 0.99), and cellulose concentration (r(2) = 0.76). Redundancy analysis suggests that there is a large percentage (52%) of the spectrum not explained by the PFTs measured in this study. However, spectral discrimination of functional groups, and even species, appears promising, mostly in the ultraviolet A part of the spectrum. This has interesting applications for mapping PFTs using remote sensing techniques, and therefore for estimating related ecosystem processes and services.

AB Remote sensing data and techniques are reliable tools for monitoring and studying urban land cover and land use (LCLU) change. Fine spatial resolution (FRes) commercial satellite image in conjunction with geographic object based image change analysis (GEOBICA) methods have been used to generate detailed and accurate urban LCLU maps. The integration of a backdating approach improves LCLU change classification results for the first date of a bi-temporal image sequences. Conversely, moderate spatial resolution satellite images such as those from Landsat sensors may not allow for detailed urban land use and land cover mapping. The objective of this study is to test a new bi-temporal change identification approach that integrates image classification of fine spatial resolution satellite imagery at time-2 and moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery (Landsat) at time-1, in a backdating and GEOBICA framework for mapping urban land use change. We compare the results from this approach to those of a GEOBICA approach based on fine spatial resolution imagery in both periods. The overall accuracy of the time-1 Landsat image classification is 0.82 and that of the fine spatial resolution image is 0.87. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the areal change data estimated from the pixel-wise spatial overlay of bitemporal FRes LCLU maps is 0.80 while that from overlaying a time-2 FRes-generated map to that from a Landsat time-1 image is 0.81. The proposed method can be used in areas that lack FRes data due to limited coverage in the early 2000s.

AB This work aims to assess a diagnostic approach which links evapotranspiration (ET) to land surface temperature (LST) measured by thermal remote sensing in the Alps. We estimated gridded ET, from field (30 m) to regional (1 km) scales, and we performed a specific study on grassland ecosystems in the Alps in South Tyrol (Italy), to evaluate the model sensitivity to different types of land management. The energy balance model TSEB ALEXI (Two Source Energy Balance Atmosphere Land EXchange Inverse) was first applied to Meteosat satellite data. Then ET was estimated by the flux disaggregation procedure DisALEXI, driven by MODIS and Landsat LST retrievals, which has never been applied before in a mountain region. We evaluated the model against eddy covariance (EC) measurements from established stations in the Alps, and analyzed the main limitations which affect the model performance in mountainous regions. The TSEB model, applied in plot-scale mode using tower based meteorological and LST input data, performed well with errors in daytime (6-18 UTC + 1) latent heat flux around 30-60 W m(-2) in comparison with flux measurements corrected for the lack of closure in the energy balance. For landscape ET retrievals, while Landsat resolution (30 m) is preferable for capturing small-scale heterogeneity in landscape moisture conditions, and for direct comparison with tower fluxes, persistent cloud cover resulted in no clear Landsat scenes during the study period. MODIS-based retrievals at 1 km resolution are too coarse to resolve the flux tower footprint in this complex landscape, yielding discrepancies of 100 W m(-2) in model-measurement comparisons. Still, MODIS DisALEXI partitioning of the energy budget was reasonable and enabled to detect evaporative stress at regional scale expressed as the ratio between actual and potential ET, WET. We evaluated WET in comparison with a crop stress index based on cumulative air temperature and precipitation at different stations in the study area, and investigated ability to capture differential responses between managed and unmanaged grasslands. Results show that in the Alps i) moderate resolution thermal data can be used to monitor evaporative stress at the regional scale; ii) the spatial-temporal evolution of ET can be characterized from MODIS and Landsat thermal data with limitations which are due to the low availability of clear-sky scenes and to the small-scale (similar to 10 m) changes in soil moisture, topography and canopy density, which control ET patterns in mountainous regions; iii) solar radiation and leaf area index are critical variables which strongly affect the accuracy of the modeled energy fluxes.

AB Climate change projections foresee an increasing number of intense precipitation events with consequent flash and riverine floods. An accurate and rapid mapping of these phenomena is a key component of effective emergency management and disaster risk reduction plans. Earth Observation big data such as the ones acquired by the Copernicus programme, are providing unprecedented opportunities to detect changes and assess economic impacts in case of disasters.
   This paper presents an innovative flood mapping technique based on an index which is computed using multi temporal statistics of Synthetic Aperture Radar images. The index compares a large amount of reference scenes to those acquired during the investigated flood and allows an easy categorization of "flooded" areas; either areas solely temporarily covered by water or areas with mixed water and vegetation. The method has been developed specifically to exploit Sentinel-1 data but can be applied to any other sensor. It has been tested for the 2010 flood of Veneto (Italy) and the floods of 2015 in Malawi and Uganda. Extensive qualitative analysis and cross-comparison with other state-of-the art methods, proved the proposed approach highly reliable and particularly effective, allowing a precise, simple and fast flood mapping. Compared to the maps produced for emergency management for the event analyzed, we obtained an overall agreement of 96.7% for Malawi and an average of 96.5% for Veneto for the 5 maps presented.

AB Timely and accurate delineation of global urban land is fundamental to the understanding of global environmental changes. However, most of the contemporary global urban land maps have coarse resolutions and are available for one or two years only. In this study, we developed the multi-temporal global urban land maps based on Landsat images for the 1990-2010 period with a five-year interval ('Urban land' in these maps refers to 'impervious surface', i.e., artificial cover and structures such as pavement, concrete, brick, stone and other man-made impenetrable cover types). We proposed the method of Normalized Urban Areas Composite Index (NUACI) and utilized the Google Earth Engine to facilitate the global urban land classifications from an extensive number of Landsat images. The global level's overall accuracy, producer's accuracy and user's accuracy for our mapping results are 0.81-0.84, 0.50-0.60 and 0.49-0.61, respectively. The Kappa values are 0.43-0.50 at the global level, and similar to 0.33 (in China) and similar to 0.42 (in the U.S.) at the country level. By analyzing the presented dataset, we found that the world's urban land area had increased from 450.97 +/- 1.18 thousand km(2) in 1990 to 747.05 +/- 1.50 thousand km(2) in 2010, reaching a global coverage of 0.63%. China, the United States and India together (14% of the world's terrestrial area in total) contributed almost 43% of the total increase of global urban land area.

AB Monitoring vegetation dynamics at global scale is equally important in the context of terrestrial ecosystem carbon exchange and climate-biosphere, interactions. The Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) method and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at a spatial resolution of 250 m were used to detect vegetation dynamics in Quebec during 2000-2011. The overall agreement between BFAST detected breaks and observed disturbances was about 64% with the highest agreement up to 80% for "Fire" disturbance. The results presented in this study indicated that 25.7% of the total study area experienced NDVI trend changes with one or more breaks during 2000-2011, most of which were detected in the Boreal Shield eco-zone along the coastline of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Abrupt vegetation changes barely varied under different eco-zones while considerably varied with different land cover types. The abrupt changes areas in 2002 and 2009 were the two greatest, with area percentages of 17.4% and 29.1% of the whole area, respectively. The area percentages of years with abrupt trend changes indicated that abrupt vegetation greening occurred in 2008 and 2009, especially in 2009, with 58.3% of the overall abrupt greening. Abrupt vegetation browning occurred in 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2007, especially in 2002, with 28.2% of the overall abrupt browning. Moreover, our results indicated that the detected vegetation trends varied temporally and spatially. Disturbances from existing field observations or remotely sensed images could only interpret < 40% of the vegetation changes. The impact of climate change on vegetation dynamic is particularly worth being investigated in the future work. To our knowledge, this study is one of the few attempting to explore large-scale detection of vegetation dynamics and their potential drivers in eastern Canada.

AB Hyperspectral data, with their detailed spectral information at different wavelengths, offer multiple ways to assess biodiversity. One approach, known as the "spectral variation hypothesis" (SVH), proposes that biodiversity is linked to spectral diversity. However, SVH-based approaches, which we refer to as "spectral diversity metrics", can be confounded by soil exposure and are sensitive to the spatial resolution of the data. To address these issues, we 1) investigated the impact of soil exposure on spectral diversity, 2) identified optimal bands for mapping biodiversity using a spectral diversity metric based on dimension reduction, and 3) assessed the impact of spatial resolution on spectral diversity metrics. In this study; alpha-diversity (species richness) was used as a measure of plant biodiversity. The study was based on two imaging spectrometry data sets from the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Central Minnesota, USA, at two levels: proximal and airborne. The data sets included varying degrees of soil background sampled at two different spatial resolutions (1 mm and 0.75 m). We explored five spectral diversity metrics, including the coefficient of variation, convex hull volume, spectral angle mapper, spectral information divergence, and a newly proposed dimension reduction-based metric called "convex hull area." For the proximal data set (pixel size of 1 mm), filtering soil pixels by applying a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) threshold improved the performance of all spectral diversity metrics significantly, with the coefficient of variation showing the highest correlation with species richness. In the airborne data set (pixel size of 0.75 m), the convex hull area outperformed other metrics. These findings demonstrate promising approaches for remote sensing of biodiversity, illustrate a confounding effect of soil background on remote diversity measurement, and indicate that the most informative regions of the electromagnetic spectrum for estimating species richness can vary with spatial scale.

AB High spatiotemporal land surface temperature (LST) datasets are increasingly needed in a variety of fields such as ecology, hydrology, meteorology, epidemiology, and energy systems. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily LST is one of such high spatiotemporal datasets that are widely used. But, it has a large amount of missing values primarily because of clouds, shadows, and other atmospheric conditions. Gapfilling the missing values is an important approach to create seamless high spatiotemporal LST datasets. However, current gapfilling methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and efficiency to assemble the data over large areas (e.g., national and continental levels). In this study, we developed a 3-step hybrid method by integrating daily merging (gapfilling missing values at one overpass using values at the other three overpasses each day), spatiotemporal gapfilling (estimating missing values based on values of their spatial and temporal neighbors), and temporal interpolation (gapfilling missing values based on values of their neighboring days), to create a seamless high spatiotemporal LST dataset using the four daily LST observations from the two MODIS instruments on Terra and Aqua satellites. We applied this method in urban and surrounding areas in the conterminous U.S. in 2010. The evaluation of the gapfilled LST product indicates its root mean squared error (RMSE) to be 3.3 K for mid-daytime (1:30 pm) and 2.7 K for mid-nighttime (1:30 am) observations. The method can be easily extended to other years and regions and is also applicable to other satellite products for large areas. This seamless daily (mid-daytime and mid-nighttime) LST product with 1 km spatial resolution is of great value for studying urban climate (e.g., quantifying surface urban heat island intensity, creating seamless high spatiotemporal air temperature dataset) and the related impacts on people (e.g., health and mortality), ecosystems (e.g., phenology), and energy systems (e.g., building energy use).

AB Regional to global-scale biomass burning emissions inventories are primarily based on satellite-derived bumed area or fire radiative power (FRP), and most rely on conversions to fuel consumption prior to the emissions estimation stage. This is generally considered the step introducing greatest uncertainty, and some apparently discrete inventories are not fully independent, as they have been cross-calibrated to aid this stage. We present a novel emissions inventory approach that bypasses the fuel consumption step, directly linking geostationary FRP measures to emission rates of total particulate matter (TPM), via coefficients derived from observations of smoke plume aerosol optical depth (AOD). The approach is fully top-down', being based on spacebome observations alone, is performed at or close to the FRP data's original pixel resolution, and avoids the need to assume or model fuel consumption per unit area prior to the emissions calculation. Rates and totals of trace gas and carbon emission can be inferred from the TPM fluxes, and in combination with satellite burned area (BA) products the approach provides an innovative top down approach to mapping fuel consumption per unit area (kgm(-2)) as a last step in the calculation. Using this innovative methodology, which we term 'FREemissions' (FREM), we generate a 2004-2012 fire emissions inventory for southern Africa, based on Meteosat FRP-PIXEL data. We find basic annual average TPM emissions 45% higher than the widely used GFASv1.2 inventory, with our higher totals in line with independent assessments that necessitate a significant upscaling of GFAS TPM emissions to match observed AODs. Our estimates are also 12% higher than GFEDv4.1s, which already includes a substantial upward adjustment for fires too small to be detected by the MODIS MCD64A1 BA product. If we adjust the FREM-derived emissions for SEVIRI's inability to detect the lower FRP component of the regions fire regime then the differences between FREM and GFAS/GFED grow further, to a mean of 64% with respect to GFED4.1s TPM emissions for example. These upwardly adjusted FREM estimates agree very well with FEER, an FRP- and AOD-based inventory driven by polar-orbiting MODIS FRP 'snapshots' rather than geostationary observations. Similarly higher totals are seen for FREM's fire-emitted trace gases, derived using the emission factor ratios of gases to particulates. Our exploitation of geostationary FRP requires fewer assumptions than use of polar orbiter FRP measures, avoids biases coming from incomplete sampling of the fire diurnal cycle, and enables the FREM approach to provide fire emissions and fuel consumption estimates at a higher spatio-temporal resolution than any inventory currently available (e.g. 0.05 degrees and hourly averages or better), including per km(2) of area burned. The approach offers great potential to generate very high resolution fire emissions datasets for the tropics, sub-tropics and potentially temperate zones, with updates available in near real-time from the global suite of geostationary meteorological satellites operated by organisations such as EUMETSAT (Meteosat), NOAA (GOES) and JMA (Himawari).

AB This study explores how climate and nutrients influence productivity of arctic wetland plants. The Green-excess Index (GEI) derived from Red, Green and Blue digital image brightness values from digital repeat photography (a.k.a. phenocams) was used to track the inter-annual variability in seasonal greening and above ground biomass for two dominant aquatic emergent graminoids on the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska: Carex aquatilis and Arctophila fulva. Four years of seasonal and inter-annual greening trends show strong differences in timing and intensity of greenness among species. Thawing degree-days (TDD, days above 0 degrees C) was a good predictor of GEI in both A. fulva and C. aquatilis. Employing regression tree analyses, we found a greening threshold of 46 TDD for A. fulva, after which GEI increased markedly, while C. aquatilis greened more gradually with a greening mid-point of 31 TDD. Based on long-term climate records and TDD thresholds, greening date has begun 16 thawing degree-days earlier over the past 70 years. To understand the effects of latitude and nutrients on seasonal greening, we compared southern sites and nutrient enriched sites with reference sites. We found statistically higher greenness in southern sites and enriched sites compare to reference sites in both plant species, supporting the role of nutrients and warmer temperatures as key factors enhancing productivity in arctic wetlands. In addition, this study provides an inexpensive, alternative method to monitor climate and nutrient effects at high frequency in arctic aquatic systems through camera-derived GEI greenness and has the potential to bridge the gap between plot level and satellite based observations given its strong relationships with biomass and NDVI.

AB We used 26 Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR-X single- and dual-co-polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images of a test site on the German North Sea coast to investigate the influence of imaging geometry and environmental conditions (wind speed, water level, and vegetation period) on the radar return from exposed intertidal flats. Multi-temporal analyses of single- (VV-) polarization SAR imagery indicate that the surface roughness is more variable at shorter scales (responsible for the X-band backscatter) than at longer scales (C-band). Less variation at both radar bands was found in sea-grass meadows. TerraSAR-X dual-co-polarization data were used for polarimetric analyses based on a decomposition of the Kennaugh matrix, whose elements provide information on the total intensity at both co-polarizations and on the relative strength of even- and odd-bounce backscattering. At steep incidence angles (around 30 degrees) the radar backscatter from bare sand flats is similarly strong at both co-polarizations, while the vertically polarized radar return dominates at higher incidence angles (above 40). At low water levels, resulting in lower moisture of the sandy sediments, strong single-bounce radar backscattering was observed, while higher water levels (and moisture) caused weak mixed (single- and double-bounce) backscattering. Apart from the absolute water level its history, e.g. the time and level of the closest low tide, must be considered. During the vegetation period, sea-grass meadows cause a stronger increase in horizontally (HH-) polarized radar backscatter, along with an increased double-bounce backscattering. We conclude that the Kennaugh element framework has potential to be used for classification purposes in intertidal areas, but also that, for a full interpretation of the SAR imagery, the exact topography and the surface roughness have to be known.

AB Mangrove forest phenology at the regional scale have been poorly investigated and its driving factors remain unclear. Multi-temporal remote sensing represents a key tool to investigate vegetation phenology, particularly in environments with limited accessibility and lack of in situ measurements. This paper presents the first characterisation of mangrove forest phenology from the Yucatan Peninsula, south east Mexico. We used 15-year time-series of four vegetation indices (EVI, NDVI, gNDVI and NDWI) derived from MODIS surface reflectance to estimate phenological parameters which were then compared with in situ climatic variables, salinity and litterfall. The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) was used to smooth the raw data and four phenological parameters were estimated: start of season (SOS), time of maximum greenness (Max Green), end of season (EOS) and length of season (LOS). Litterfall showed a distinct seasonal pattern with higher rates during the end of the dry season and during the wet season. Litterfall was positively correlated with temperature (r = 0.88, p < 0.01) and salinity (r = 0.70, p < 0.01). The results revealed that although mangroves are evergreen species the mangrove forest has clear greenness seasonality which is negatively correlated with litterfall and generally lagged behind maximum rainfall. The dates of phenological metrics varied depending on the choice of vegetation indices reflecting the sensitivity of each index to a particular aspect of vegetation growth. NDWI, an index associated to canopy water content and soil moisture had advanced dates of SOS, Max Green and EOS while gNDVI, an index primarily related to canopy chlorophyll content had delayed dates. SOS ranged between day of the year (DOY) 144 (late dry season) and DOY 220 (rainy season) while the EOS occurred between DOY 104 (mid-dry season) to DOY 160 (early rainy season). The length of the growing season ranged between 228 and 264 days. Sites receiving a greater amount of rainfall between January and March showed an advanced SOS and Max Green. This phenological characterisation is useful to understand the mangrove forest dynamics at the landscape scale and to monitor the status of mangrove. In addition the results will serve as a baseline against which to compare future changes in mangrove phonology due to natural or anthropogenic causes.

AB Simulating hydrological processes within the (semi -)arid region of the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB), Australia, is very challenging specially during droughts. In this study, we investigate whether integrating remotely sensed terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission into a global water resources and use model enables a more realistic representation of the basin hydrology during droughts. For our study, the WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM), which simulates the impact of human water abstractions on surface water and groundwater storage, has been chosen for simulating compartmental water storages and river discharge during the so-called 'Millennium Drought' (2001-2009). In particular, we test the ability of a parameter calibration and data assimilation (C/DA) approach to introduce long-term trends into WGHM, which are poorly represented due to errors in forcing, model structure and calibration. For the first time, the impact of the parameter equifinality problem on the C/DA results is evaluated. We also investigate the influence of selecting a specific GRACE data product and filtering method on the final C/DA results. Integrating GRACE data into WGHM does not only improve simulation of seasonality and trend of TWSC, but also it improves the simulation of individual water storage components. For example, after the C/DA, correlations between simulated groundwater storage changes and independent in-situ well data increase (up to 0.82) in three out of four sub-basins. Declining groundwater storage trends - found mainly in the south, i.e. Murray Basin, at in-situ wells - have been introduced while simulated soil water and surface water storage do not show trends, which is in agreement with existing literature. Although GRACE C/DA in MDB does not improve river discharge simulations, the correlation between river storage simulations and gauge-based river levels increases significantly from 0.15 to 0.52. By adapting the C/DA settings to the basin-specific characteristics and reducing the number of calibration parameters, their convergence is improved and their uncertainty is reduced. The time-variable parameter values resulting from C/DA allow WGHM to better react to the very wet Australian summer 2009/10. Using solutions from different GRACE data providers produces slightly different C/DA results. We conclude that a rigorous evaluation of GRACE errors is required to realistically account for the spread of the differences in the results.

AB This study presents a novel method of tornado track identification in forested regions in Europe based on remote sensing data. The method enables an objective estimate (i.e. independent of population density and observational networks) of tornado climatology in forested regions. The method is based on the identification of narrow and elongated areas as forest disturbances obtained using Landsat satellite images and Landsat-based Global Forest Change (GFC) data. These areas were subsequently verified with high-resolution satellite images for verification of a tomadic cause of forest damage. Landsat and MODIS satellite images, weather station observations and reanalysis data were additionally involved in order to determine tornado dates. A minimum F scale tornado intensity was estimated by a Weibull distribution model using information on tornado path lengths and widths. The method is applied to the forested regions of northeast Europe, where 110 tornado tracks were identified between the 2000 and 2014 years, 105 of which were previously unreported and discovered for the first time. For some regions, tornado density estimates using the new method is 2-3 times higher than other previously published estimates. The largest number of tornadoes occurred in 2009, and June is the most favourable month for tornado formation (including strong tornadoes and tornado outbreaks). Most identified tornadoes have path length < 10 km with maximum and mean widths of approximately 200-300 m and 100-200 m, respectively. A few tornadoes with long and wide paths were found; four of them likely had F3 minimal intensity.

AB Statistical estimation protocols are one of the key means to ensure that independent and objective information on product accuracy is communicated to end-users. Methods for validating burned area products have been developed based on a probability sample of a space by time partitioning of the population. We extend this basic methodology to improve stratification and sample allocation, key elements of a sampling design used to collect burned area reference data. We developed and evaluated an approach to partition each year and biome into low and high burned area (BA) strata. Because the threshold used to separate the sampling units into low and high BA can vary by year and biome, this approach offers a more targeted stratification than used in previous studies for which a common threshold was applied to all biomes. A hypothetical population of validation data was then used to quantitatively compare the precision of accuracy estimates derived from different stratification and sample size allocation options. We evaluated two options that had been previously examined in the BA validation literature, and extended previous studies by adding two new options specifically developed for ratio estimates. Stratification based on mapped BA reduced standard errors of the global burned area accuracy estimates from one-half to one-eighth relative to standard errors of simple random sampling. Stratifying by mapped BA was also found to reduce standard errors of accuracy estimates for most year by biome strata indicating that this advantage of stratification and sample allocation applies generally to a range of conditions (i.e., biomes and years).The most precise estimates were obtained using a sample size per stratum allocation n(h) proportional to N-h root(BA(h)) over bar where N-h is the number of units in stratum h and (BA(h)) over bar is the mean mapped BA for stratum h. The best sampling design from our analyses was then used to select a set of 1,000 samples from a hypothetical population of validation data and confidence intervals were computed for each sample. Close to 95% of these confidence intervals contained the true population value thus confirming the validity of confidence intervals produced from the estimates and standard errors.

AB This study investigates and compares the potential of three model-based polarimetric decompositions, namely those developed by Freeman-Durden (1998), Hajnsek et al. (2009) and An et al. (2010), for soil moisture retrieval over agricultural fields covered by several crops. The volume scattering component was first removed from the full coherency matrix. Then, in order to reduce the effect of the incidence angle on the retrieval results, a normalization process at a reference incidence angle was conducted for the first time, on the dominant surface or dihedral scattering component from which the soil moisture was retrieved. The time series of Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data and the ground measurements of soil and vegetation characteristics collected during the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Validation Experiment in 2012 (SMAPVEX12) were used to compare the three decomposition methods with respect to the scattering mechanisms and the soil moisture retrieval performances. The results show that the performance of each decomposition method for soil moisture retrieval depends on the crop types and the crop phenological stages. Indeed, Freeman-Durden model provided the best results for corn and wheat, Hajnsek decomposition performed well for canola, while better results were obtained for soybean using An decomposition. At the early growth stage, both the surface and dihedral scattering components contributed to retrieve the soil moisture, while at a later crop development, the surface scattering component is almost the only scattering mechanism from which soil moisture was retrieved. Thus, the best performance for soil moisture retrieval was obtained a) at the early crop development stage from Hajnsek decomposition which better integrated the dihedral component and b) at a later growth stage from An decomposition which enhanced the surface scattering. Finally, an overall soil moisture underestimation with RMSE of 0.06-0.11 m(3)/m(3) was observed from the three decompositions, and the highest retrieval rate of 33%-39% was obtained from An decomposition as a result of the enhanced surface scattering.

AB Knowledge of soil moisture, however varied in space and time, is critical for planning land use in water-limited drylands. Although satellite observations provide soil moisture instantaneously at large scale, few studies have addressed the application of satellite soil moisture retrieval in dryland areas with changing land use. In this study, we propose a method to evaluate the spatiotemporal variance of satellite retrieval based on the evaluation of soil moisture retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The operation period of this instrument (June 2002 to October 2011) covers the re-vegetation of the semi-arid Loess Plateau. Our study found that AMSR-E retrievals posted by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) capture the spatiotemporal variance of soil moisture in the Loess Plateau, as well as the in-situ measured soil moisture decrease following the massive re-vegetation-despite it differing from the in-situ measurement in spatial scale. Soil moisture decrease in response to the massive re-vegetation occurred in a transition zone of grass-forest ecosystems with annual precipitation between 450 and 550 mm. Our study suggests that current AMSR-E JAXA retrievals are an essential alternative to field measurement and model simulation, because they can identify the location and spatial extent of areas where soil moisture is sensitive to climate change and managed re-vegetation. To avoid the overconsumption of soil water and limited plant growth in transition zone, managers of dryland areas should pay special attention to species selection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Supraglacial lakes (SGLs) on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) influence ice dynamics if they drain rapidly by hydrofracture. MODIS data are often used to investigate SGLs, including calculating SGL area changes through time, but no existing work presents a method that tracks changes to individual (and total) SGL volume in MODIS imagery over a melt season. Here, we develop such a method by first testing three automated approaches to derive SGL areas from MODIS images from the MOD09 level-2 surface-reflectance product, by comparing calculated areas for the Paakitsoq and Store Glacier regions in West Greenland with areas derived from Landsat-8 (LS8) images. Second, we apply a physically-based depth-calculation algorithm to the pixels within the SGL boundaries from the best performing area-derivation method, and compare the resultant depths with those calculated using the same method applied to LS8 imagery. Our results indicate that SGL areas are most accurately generated using dynamic thresholding of MODIS band 1 (red) MOD09 data with a 0.640 threshold value; calculated values from MODIS are closely comparable to those derived from LS8. Third, we incorporate the best performing area- and depth-detection methods into a Fully Automated SGL Tracking ("FAST") algorithm that tracks individual SGLs between successive MODIS images. Finally, we apply the FAST algorithm to the two study regions, where it identifies 43 (Paakitsoq) and 19 (Store Glacier) rapidly draining SGLs during 2014, representing 21% and 15% of the respective total SGL populations, including some clusters of rapidly draining SGLs. The FAST algorithm improves upon existing automatic SGL tracking methods through its calculation of both SGL areas and volumes over large regions of the GrIS on a fully automatic basis. It therefore has the potential to be used for investigating statistical relationships between SGL areas, volumes and drainage events over the whole of the GrIS, and over multiple seasons, which might provide further insights into the factors that trigger rapid SGL drainage.

AB Rice phenology information is critical for farm management and productivity evaluation. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data are very useful for monitoring rice growth. Therefore, this paper focuses on building a robust, accurate and operational scheme for phenology estimation based on SAR and multi spectral remote sensing data. The proposed scheme has three main improvements. First, two main types of rice field - transplanted indica rice field (TRF) and direct-sown japonica rice field (DRF) - were considered individually. Second, 149 SAR signatures and optical Vegetation Indices (Vls) were extracted from time-series of optical and full/compact-pol SAR data and a novel feature selection method based on Monte Carlo experiments and the correlation limitation (MCCL) was proposed. Third, six different phenological labeling cases were considered, with the multiclass relevant vector machine (mRVM) being used to identify different stages. Based on the improvements above, we generated the optimal feature matrix based on the MCCL; this matrix consisted of the optimal feature subset (OFS) used for the identification of each stage. The overall phenological estimation accuracy (OPEA) based on the optical Vls and SAR signatures together (86.59%), was shown to be better than that based on either the optical Vls or the SAR signatures only. In addition, it was significant to consider the differences between the DRF and TRF for rice phenology estimation. The OPEA was higher than 85% when the DRF and TRF were considered separately, much higher than the accuracy obtained (68.89%) when the differences between the DRF and TRF were ignored. Lastly, the availability of the proposed feature selection method MCCL was discussed. It was found that the best OPEA was generated using the OFS selected by the proposed MCCL when the dimensions of the OFS were kept small. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to regionally monitor crop progress and condition through the growing season benefits both crop management and yield estimation. In the United States, these metrics are reported weekly at state or district (multiple counties) levels by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) using field observations provided by trained local reporters. However, the ground data collection process supporting this effort is time consuming and subjective. Furthermore, operational crop management and yield estimation efforts require information with more granularity than at the state or district level. This paper evaluates remote sensing approaches for mapping crop phenology using vegetation index time-series generated by fusing Landsat and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface reflectance imagery to improve temporal sampling over that provided by Landsat alone. The case study focuses on an agricultural region in central Iowa from 2001 to 2014. Our objectives are 1) to assess Landsat-MODIS data fusion results over cropland; 2) to map crop phenology at 30 m resolution using fused surface reflectance data; and 3) to identify the relationships between remotely sensed crop phenology metrics and the crop progress stages reported by NASS. The results show that detailed spatial and temporal variability in vegetation development across this landscape can be identified using the fused Landsat-MODIS data. The mean difference (bias) in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between actual Landsat observations and the fused Landsat-MODIS data, generated for Landsat overpass dates, is in the range of 0.011 to 0.028 for every year. The derived phenological metrics show distinct features for different crops and natural vegetation at field scales. Strong correlations are observed between remotely sensed phenological stages, based on NDVI curve inflection points, and the observed crop physiological growth stages from the NASS Crop Progress (CP) reports. The green-up dates detected from remote sensing data typically occurred during crop vegetative stages when 2-4 leaves were developed for both corn and soybeans, or about 1-3 weeks after the reported emergence dates when the plant were first visible to ground based observers. Despite being a lagging indicator, remotely sensed green-up can be used effectively to backcast emergence, e.g. as input to spatially distributed crop models. The differences in green-up date between corn and soybean were 8-10 days, consistent with the offset in emergence dates reported by NASS at district level. The reported harvest dates were typically about 2-3 weeks after the dormancy stage was detected via remote sensing for corn and about 1-2 weeks for soybeans. This suggests that probable harvest times for individual fields may be predicted 1-3 weeks ahead using remote sensing data. The results suggest that crop phenology and certain growth stages at field scales (30 m spatial resolution) can be linked and mapped by integrating imagery from multiple remote sensing platforms.

AB Sentinel-2 is a very new programme of the European Space Agency (ESA) that is designed for fine spatial resolution global monitoring. Sentinel-2 images provide four 10 m bands and six 20 m bands. To provide more explicit spatial information, this paper aims to downscale the six 20 m bands to 10 m spatial resolution using the four directly observed 10 m bands. The outcome of this fusion task is the production of 10 Sentinel-2 bands with 10 m spatial resolution. This new fusion problem involves four fine spatial resolution bands, which is different to, and more complex than, the common pan-sharpening fusion problem which involves only one fine band. To address this, we extend the existing two main families of image fusion approaches (i.e., component substitution, CS, and multiresolution analysis, MRA) with two different schemes, a band synthesis scheme and a band selection scheme. Moreover, the recently developed area-to-point regression kriging (ATPRK) approach was also developed and applied for the Sentinel-2 fusion task. Using two Sentinel-2 datasets released online, the three types of approaches (eight CS and MRA-based approaches, and ATPRK) were compared comprehensively in terms of their accuracies to provide recommendations for the task of fusion of Sentinel-2 images. The downscaled ten band 10 m Sentinel-2 datasets represent important and promising products for a wide range of applications in remote sensing. They also have potential for blending with the upcoming Sentinel-3 data for fine spatio-temporal resolution monitoring at the global scale. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The semi-empirical, kernel-driven, linear RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model is used to generate the routine MODIS BRDF/Albedo product due to its global applicability and the underlying physics. A challenge of this model in regard to surface reflectance anisotropy effects comes from its underestimation of the directional reflectance signatures near the Sun illumination direction; also known as the hotspot effect. In this study, a method has been developed for improving the ability of the RTLSR model to simulate the magnitude and width of the hotspot effect. The method corrects the volumetric scattering component of the RTLSR model using an exponential approximation of a physical hotspot kernel, which recreates the hotspot magnitude and width using two free parameters (C-1 and C-2, respectively). The approach allows one to reconstruct, with reasonable accuracy, the hotspot effect by adjusting or using the prior values of these two hotspot variables. Our results demonstrate that: (1) significant improvements in capturing hotspot effect can be made to this method by using the invested hotspot parameters; (2) the reciprocal nature allow this method to be more adaptive for simulating the hotspot height and width with high accuracy, especially in cases where hotspot signatures are available; and (3) while the new approach is consistent with the heritage RTLSR model inversion used to estimate intrinsic narrowband and broadband albedos, it presents some differences for vegetation clumping index (CI) retrievals. With the hotspot-related model parameters determined a priori, this method offers improved performance for various ecological remote sensing applications; including the estimation of canopy structure parameters.

AB In this study, measurements of solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) at 760 nm (F-760) are combined with hyperspectral reflectance (R) measurements collected in the field over agricultural crops in order to better understand the fluorescence (ChlF) signal of the vegetation. The 'Soil-Canopy Observation Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes' (SCOPE) model, which combines radiative transfer and enzyme kinetics of photosynthesis with turbulent heat exchange in vegetation canopies, was partly inverted to obtain model parameters from R taken over healthy (unstressed) crops during the growing season. Reflectance spectra between 400 and 900 nm obtained at midday on different days in the growing season were used to obtain pigment concentrations, leaf area index and leaf inclination. These parameters were then used to simulate diurnal cycles of half-hourly ChIF spectra, using measured weather variables as input. Three scenarios were simulated: (i) a constant emission efficiency of ChIF (at the photosystem level), (ii) a variable emission efficiency calculated per half hour with an electron transport, photosynthesis and ChlF model for the photosystem, and (iii) a constant emission efficiency that was set to a theoretical maximum value for fully blocked photochemical electron transport of photosystem II and minimal non-photochemical quenching. The simulations of the first two scenarios were compared to ChIF retrieved from field measurements in the O-2-A band with the spectral fitting method in unstressed rice and alfalfa. This comparison and a sensitivity analysis showed that SCOPE reproduces most of the seasonal variability of SIF after tuning to R even if the ChlF emission efficiency is kept constant, and F760 values are mostly determined by chlorophyll content, dry matter, senescent material and leaf area and leaf inclination, whereas leaf water and carotenoid content had small effects. Diurnal variations in the ChIF emission efficiency at photosystem level were small in these crops. The simulations of the third scenario were compared to measurements of grass that was treated chemically to block electron transport and to provoke maximum ChlF. This comparison showed that the observed increase in F760 can indeed be explained by a change in the ChIF emission efficiency at the photo system level. It is concluded that hyperspectral reflectance and the ChIF signal together can reveal both the dynamics of vegetation structure and functioning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Landsat time-series multi-spectral data, GLAS (Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) height data and a regression tree model were used to estimate tree height for a transect in Sub-Saharan Africa ranging from the Sahara Desert through the Congo Basin to the Kalahari Desert (+22 to -22 degrees latitude and 23 to 24 degrees longitude). Objectives included comparing the performance of Landsat 7- and 8-derived inputs separately and combined in mapping tree height at a regional scale, assessing the relative value of good observation counts and different Landsat spectral inputs for tree height estimation across a range of environments, and describing tree height distributions and discontinuities in Sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 5371 images were processed and per pixel quality assessed to create a set of multi-temporal metrics for the 2013 and 2014 calendar years for Landsat 7 only, Landsat 8 only and both Landsat 7 and 8 combined. Differences in performance were slight between different sensor inputs. However, performance generally improved with increasing numbers of good observations. Metrics derived from red reflectance data contributed most in estimating tree height. The regression tree algorithm accurately reproduced theLiDAR-derived height training data with an overall mean absolute error (MAE) for tree height estimation of 2.45 m using integrated Landsat 7 and 8 data. Significant underestimations were quantified for tall tree cover (MAE of 4.65 m for >20 m heights) and overestimations for low/no tree cover (MAE 1.61 for <5 m heights). Resulting tree distributions were found to be discontinuous with a primary dry seasonal woodlands cluster of 510 m in height, a second cluster of primarily dry evergreen forest tree cover from 11-17 m, and a third cluster of humid evergreen forest tree cover >= 18 m. The integration of Landsat 7 and 8 and forthcoming Sentinel 2 time-series optical data to extend the value of LiDAR forest structure measurements is recommended. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB Decades of successful active fire mapping from space, have led to global informational products of growing importance to scientific community and operational agencies. In contrast, detecting fires from space faster than current conventional capabilities in the continental U.S. has not been considered attainable, except in remote, sparsely populated areas. We present a research prototype version of the GOES Early Fire Detection (GOES-EFD) algorithm focused on minimizing the time to first detection of a wildfire incident. The algorithm is designed for regional-scale surveillance and combines multitemporal anomaly tests developed in our previous work, contextual hot-spot tests, and dynamic event classification and tracking. The GOES-EFD version 0.4 was initially tested with 40-day summer 2006 data over central California. The algorithm identified most of large (final size> 2 ha) wildfires within 30 min and 31% of the wildfires were detected before they were reported by the public. Under identical operation conditions, GOES-EFD 0.4 provided quicker initial detection than the temporally filtered operational WF-ABBA algorithm (version 6.1) and committed fewer false alarms. There is a substantial potential for further reducing detection latency and increasing reliability. Following the ongoing optimizations, tests, and integration in collaboration with the fire management agencies and first responders, GOES-EFD could be deployed for regional scale real-time surveillance to complement existing fire identification methods.

AB The existence and detection of leads are critical to obtain a local Sea Surface Height (SSH) reference for computing total freeboard and sea ice thickness from NASA's IceBridge Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) elevations. However, the shaded areas of the Digital Mapping System (DMS) images and the biased ATM elevations impact the correct determination of leads and SSH. This study develops an automated approach to overcome the above challenges and to correctly determine SSHs by combining DMS images, ATM L1B's apparent reflectivity and statistical discrimination. Dynamic pixel intensity thresholds are established to classify leads under different solar illuminations. This automated approach is then validated by manual selection in detecting SSHs. The high agreement of SSHs from this automated approach with those from manual selection indicates the reliability and usefulness of this approach. Within a 45-km section of one ATM L1B file, SSH demonstrates a linear gradient, which is applied to derive SSHs where there are no leads. The resulted SSHs are then used to compute total freeboard and ice thickness. This automated approach is also tried to retrieve SSH and then compute the total freeboard on one entire IceBridge sea ice flight each in Arctic and Antarctica. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Changes of permafrost not only affect regional and global water circulation, carbon deposit and climate warming, but also influence ground ecological, geophysical, and biogeochemical processes in cold region. Monitoring surface deformation over permafrost will help to understand the dynamics of these processes, assess climate changes, and prevent potential damages to engineering structures underlain by permafrost. This article employs an improved small baseline subset lnterferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technique to monitor the surface deformation over the Danxiong-Yangbajing area in the southern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), with emphasis on climatic factors modeling. A new deformation model considering both the external (mainly climatic) and internal factors (such as tectonic activities and thermal character of frozen soil) is constructed and introduced into the SBAS-InSAR to estimate the surface deformation over permafrost. The results show that the peak-to-peak annual deformation over natural surface is 3.6-5.0 cm, while that along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway (QTH) and the Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR) is 2.8-3.7 cm. We also find that the surface deformation over frozen soil is negatively correlated to air temperature and precipitation, with the correlation being -0.80 to -0.45 and -0.95 to -0.75, respectively. The root mean squares (RMSs) of the residual (un-modeled) deformation got by the proposed method are much smaller than that by the existing methods. We also successfully examine a time lag of about 60 days between the retrieved maximal subsidence and the highest air temperature in warm seasons (from May to September). After compensating for this time lag, the RMSs of the residual deformation reduce significantly and the correlation between the deformation and the temperature rises considerably, varying from -0.95 to -0.65. The method presented in this paper is more suitable to model and analyze the surface deformation in permafrost areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forestry and nature conservation can benefit from rapid on-line information on forest disturbances, such as insect attacks. This type of information would facilitate timely field studies and enable more rapid counter measures, as well as enable studies of the dynamics of an insect outbreak. In this study we developed a method based on MODIS derived NDVI for near real-time monitoring of insect induced forest defoliation in a subalpine birch forest in northern Sweden. The method is based on deviations from a seasonal trajectory of NDVI representing forest conditions without disturbances. A Kalman filter is applied to handle noise and satellite derived NDVI observations of low quality, and cumulative sums (CUSUM) of the deviations from the seasonal trajectory representing undisturbed forests are used to detect disturbances. An annual offset of the seasonal trajectory is introduced in CUSUM to handle inter-annual variability in the start of season. Evaluation of the method showed that 74% of the defoliation was detected with a misclassification of undisturbed areas of 39% in MODIS pixels with at least 50% birch forest cover. The ability of the method to detect defoliation can be adjusted to fit the purpose of a study; with a higher threshold applied, 100% of the defoliation in the evaluation data was detected with 56% of the undisturbed areas misclassified as defoliated. The method also facilitates studies of the intraseasonal temporal dynamics of an insect outbreak, which is a major advantage compared to methods that classifies pixels into undisturbed or defoliated for an entire season. Furthermore, the method can be extended to monitor within-season refoliation after an insect outbreak. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Gangotri glacier is the largest in the Garhwal Himalaya, India and its melt water forms the main source stream of the Ganga River, yet its dynamics are poorly understood. Its long record of terminus retreat measurements (1800-present) shows multi-decadal oscillations and more recently a slowing down of the retreat. Its complex dynamics are also indicated by studies of proglacial melt-water at the terminus. However, there have been no systematic measurements of its surface velocity or how it changes seasonally or over longer-term time scales. Here, I have characterized the spatiotemporal variations of surface velocity of the Gangotri glacier using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data spanning nearly two decades (1991-2011).
   The main findings are as follows: (1) The glacier undergoes seasonal fluctuations in surface velocities: there was a clear summer speedup of similar to 57%-126% compared to winter velocities between 0 and 12.6 km from the terminus, with peak summer speeds of 63.1 +/- 5.4 m/yr in 1992, 66.6 +/- 6.0 m/yr in 1999, 58.2 +/- 4.5 m/yr in 2004 and 42.8 +/- 4.2 m/yr in 2007 whereas winter speeds were relatively stable (25-30 m/yr) during the same period. This summer speedup is indicative of increased basal sliding, known to occur when melt-waters penetrate to the glacier bed resulting in reduced friction. (2) These summer velocities exhibited an inter-annual reduction, which was manifest as a reduction in summer speed up from >120% in 2004 to <60% in 2007. This pattern continued into 2011, despite the availability of abundant melt-water during those years. This inter-annual reduction indicates the formation of increasingly efficient melt-water channels year on year resulting in lesser lubrication at the glacier-bed interface.
   My results show that the Gangotri glacier is dynamic throughout its length with systematic spatiotemporal variations in surface velocity that elucidate its subglacial processes. Based on my results and other evidence in the literature, I propose that the subglacial drainage system of the Gangotri glacier is subject to seasonal and inter annual hydrodynamic coupling between winters and melt-seasons akin to other glaciers.

AB The lack of long-term PM2.5 measurements in developing countries makes it difficult to quantify the overall PM2.5 pollution exposures and health impacts in these countries where the PM2.5 concentrations are often very high. Moreover, it is also difficult for traditional fixed-site monitoring to capture the substantial spatial variability of PM2.5 over dense urban areas or regions with significant topography. Hence, recent developments in satellite based remote-sensing allowing the reconstruction of long-term, wide-area and high-resolution estimates of current and historical PM2.5 concentration is an important step forward, allowing the quantification of the long-term pollution exposure of PM2.5 in developing cities and in dense urban areas using the satellite-derived PM2.5 data. In this study, instead of just looking at the spatial average PM2.5 concentrations, we have studied the long-term population exposure of PM2.5 by analyzing the population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations at regional, city and district scales by combining 1 km x 1 km satellite-derived PM2.5 and population density data sets. The variation of population exposure to PM2.5 across the urban areas in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region from 2000 to 2014 was studied. Our result shows that the PM2.5 concentrations over the PRD increased steadily from 2000 to 2004, remained at quite a high level through 2008 and then started to decline after 2009. More importantly, our analysis also shows that, at regional, city and district levels, the population-weighted mean PM2.5 concentrations from data with 1 km resolutions are typically the highest, followed by the population-weighted mean PM2.5 concentrations from data with 10 km resolutions and then the simple spatial PM2.5 averages. This suggests that the use of simple spatial concentrations can lead to systematic underestimation of the overall population exposure and the associated health impacts. This systematic difference is related to the positive correlation between PM2.5 pollutant concentration and population density, and shows the usefulness of using high-resolution satellite-retrieved PM2.5 concentrations to quantify the overall population exposure. The higher population weighted mean PM2.5 concentration in comparison with simple spatial average indicates that, for more effective reduction of overall population exposure and protection of public health, control efforts must be further targeted at high-population high-pollution areas, and land-use and city planning should also encourage population to redistribute away from the highly polluted areas.

AB We establish a methodology for calculating uncertainties in sea surface temperature estimates from coefficient based satellite retrievals. The uncertainty estimates are derived independently of in-situ data. This enables validation of both the retrieved SSTs and their uncertainty estimate using in-situ data records. The total uncertainty budget is comprised of a number of components, arising from uncorrelated (e.g. noise), locally systematic (e.g. atmospheric), large scale systematic and sampling effects (for gridded products). The importance of distinguishing these components arises in propagating uncertainty across spatio-temporal scales. We apply the method to SST data retrieved from the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and validate the results for two different SST retrieval algorithms, both at a per pixel level and for gridded data. We find good agreement between our estimated uncertainties and validation data. This approach to calculating uncertainties in SST retrievals has a wider application to data from other instruments and retrieval of other geophysical variables. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Urban land cover mapping with very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite images has raised many concerns in the fields of environmental and social investigations, but the classical per-pixel and object-based mapping results are not accurate enough to serve these applications, owing to the inappropriate analysis scales. Accordingly, this study aims to 1) propose a self-adaptive segmentation scale (i.e., "selfhood scale"), which refers to the optimum scale for analyzing a pixel and depends on the pixel's category and surrounding contrasts; and 2) apply selfhood scales to urban land cover mapping. For the first target, a learning mechanism is presented to estimate selfhood scales; for the second target, two methods (i.e., "zipper merging" and "restricted forest") using the learned selfhood scales are proposed to respectively improve per-pixel and object-based classification results. The experimental results demonstrate that these methods achieve significant improvements in both per-pixel and object-based land cover mapping in urban areas as their overall accuracies are improved by 2.8% and 7.6% respectively. Moreover, the proposed methods are further used to generate land cover maps in Beijing and Zhuhai cities, which perform much better than the classical methods. Accordingly, it can be concluded that selfhood scales are effective to improve land cover mapping in urban areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial night lighting and its negative consequences are of interest in the fields of Astronomy, Human Geography, Ecology and Human Health. The majority of studies to date focused on the impacts light pollution has on our ability to view the night sky, as well as on biodiversity, ecosystems and humans. However, in recent years, with the emergence of new high spatial resolution sensors, providing detailed evaluation of night lights at the local level, more attention has been given for estimating and quantifying artificial light within cities. In this study, we evaluate urban night lights within the city of Jerusalem by combining data from two remote sensing tools: ground measurements using Sky Quality Meter (SQM) devices and space-borne measurements using EROS-B night light imagery. In addition, we examined the use of the SQM for evaluating artificial light in different view directions: upwards, downwards and horizontally. Differences in night lights were found between the three SQM view directions, with the brightest values measured in the horizontal direction (8.7-18.9 mag(SQM) arcsec(-2), and darlcest values in the downwards direction (11.2-19.5 mag(SQM) arcsec(-2)). The downwards SQM measurements were influenced by surface albedo, the horizontal direction was the most exposed to direct lights from buildings and cars, while in most locations the upwards direction represented skyglow. Using quantile regression we found strong correlations between the SQM and EROS-B brightness values. Statistically significant correlations (R-2 = 0.53) were found between the upwards and downwards devices to the EROS-B in the 0.95 quantile, as well as between the horizontal device to the EROS-B in the 0.90 quantile (R-2 = 0.44). In addition to local and external light sources, bright areas on the EROS-B image were associated with areas of low vegetation cover and high albedo. This study provides evidence for the correspondence between field and space-borne measurements of artificial lights and emphasizes the need for better understanding of light pollution at the local level and for taking into account of the three dimensional nature of light pollution.

AB Accurate information on land use and land cover (LULC) change is crucial for ecosystem monitoring and environmental change studies. Updating/backdating approaches have been increasingly used for LULC classification and change analysis, but mostly based on pixels. Here, we presented a new approach, an object-based backdating approach which integrates the backdating approach with an object-based method, and further compared it with the pixel-based backdating approach. We tested the new approach by using Landsat TM data collected in 2001 and 2009 at the Beijing metropolitan region. We found that: 1) an object-based backdating approach achieved higher accuracy for change detection, LULC classification and change analysis than the pixel-based backdating approach. With the object-based approach, the overall accuracies for the classification and change analysis were 84.33% (versus 69.33% for a pixel-based approach), and 80.00% (versus 70.50% for a pixel-based approach), respectively. 2) The object-based backdating approach greatly increases the efficiency because classification and change analysis are only conducted for locations with changes. The increase in efficiency is particularly important for LULC classification and change analysis conducted at a large area, for example, at the national or global scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Landsat satellites have been providing spectacular imagery of the Earth's surface for over 40 years. However, they acquire images at view angles 7.5 degrees from nadir that cause small directional effects in the surface reflectance. There are also variations with solar zenith angle over the year that can cause apparent change in reflectance even if the surface properties remain constant. When Landsat data from adjoining paths, or from long time series are used, a model of the surface anisotropy is required to adjust all Landsat observations to a uniform nadir view (primarily for visual consistency, vegetation monitoring, or detection of subtle surface changes). Here a generalized approach is developed to provide consistent view angle corrections across the Landsat archive. While this approach is not applicable for generation of Landsat surface albedo, which requires a full characterization of the surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), or for correction to a constant solar illumination angle across a wide range of sun angles, it provides Landsat nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) for a range of terrestrial monitoring applications.
   The Landsat NBAR is derived as the product of the observed Landsat reflectance and the ratio of the reflectances modeled using MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters for the observed Landsat and for a nadir view and fixed solar zenith geometry. In this study, a total of 567 conterminous United States (CONUS) January and July 2010 Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images that have swath edge overlapping paths sensed in alternating backscatter and forward scattering orientations were used. The average difference between Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM + surface reflectance in the forward and backward scatter directions at the overlapping Landsat scan edges was quantified. The CONUS July view zenith BRDF effects were about 0.02 in the Landsat visible bands, and about 0.03, 0.05 and 0.06, in the 2.1 mu m, 1.6 mu m and near infrared bands respectively. Comparisons of Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM + NBAR derived using MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters defined with respect to different spatial and temporal scales, and defined with respect to different land cover types, were undertaken. The results suggest that, because the BRDF shapes of different terrestrial surfaces are sufficiently similar over the narrow 15 Landsat field of view, a fixed set of MODIS BRDF spectral model parameters may be adequate for Landsat NBAR derivation with little sensitivity to the land cover type, condition, or surface disturbance. A fixed set of BRDF spectral model parameters, derived from a global year of highest quality snow-free MODIS BRDF product values, are provided so users may implement the described Landsat NBAR generation method.

AB This work assesses the applicability of reflectance spectroscopy to monitor petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) leaks in petroleum facilities using the direct detection of the pollutant in bare soils. A controlled, lab-scale experiment is conducted, where red latosols are contaminated with several types of hydrocarbons (crude oils and derivatives) and in different concentrations, in order to simulate leaks. Results portray key spectroscopic characteristics of contaminated soils, spectral temporal variation patterns, and spectral detection limits considering visible-near infrared and short wave infrared wavelengths. Regression analysis models allow quantifying the pollution level and estimating the hydrocarbon type. This seamless method has a great potential to be used in environmental monitoring of bare soil along refineries and pipelines. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study we compared the Savitzky-Golay, asymmetric Gaussian, double-logistic, Whittaker smoother, and discrete Fourier transformation smoothing algorithms (noise reduction) applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data, to provide continuous phenology data used for land-cover (LC) classifications across the Laurentian Great Lakes Basin (GLB). MODIS 16-day 250 m NDVI imagery for the GLB was used in conjunction with National Land Cover Database (NLCD) from 2001, 2006 and 2011, and the Cropland Data Layers (CDL) from 2011 to 2014 to conduct classification evaluations. Inter-class separability was measured by Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distances between selected cover type pairs (both general classes and specific crops), and intra-class variability was measured by calculating simple Euclidean distance for samples within cover types. For the GLB, we found that the application of a smoothing algorithm significantly reduced image noise compared to the raw data. However, the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) measures for smoothed NDVI temporal profiles resulted in large inconsistencies. Of the five algorithms tested, only the Fourier transformation algorithm and Whittaker smoother improved inter-class separability for corn soybean class pair and significantly improved overall classification accuracy. When compared to the raw NDVI data as input, the overall classification accuracy from the Fourier transformation and Whittaker smoother improved performance by approximately 2-6% for some years. Conversely, the asymmetric Gaussian and double-logistic smoothing algorithms actually led to degradation of classification performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Positional errors may cause problems when field and remotely sensed data are combined in connection with forest surveys. In this study we evaluated the effects of such errors on statistical estimates of growing stock volume using model-assisted and model-based estimation. With model-assisted estimation, positional errors affect the model parameter estimates for the models that are used as part of the estimation framework. In addition, positional errors affect the estimators, since the deviations between model predictions and field measurements are often larger than they would have been without positional errors. Using model-based estimation positional errors affect the model parameter estimates and thus the estimators. We compared the effects of positional errors in model-assisted and model-based estimation through Monte Carlo sampling simulation in a simulated study area resembling the forest conditions in Kuortane, western Finland. The forest population was created using a copula modelling approach based on field, Landsat and LiDAR data. We found that positional errors led to slightly biased estimators, and estimators with larger variances compared to the cases where data were perfectly geo-located. The relative increase of the variances of the estimators was of equal magnitude for model-assisted and model-based estimation, when models were developed and applied to data with geopositional errors. Further, the variance estimators were always more precise for the model-based estimators compared to the model-assisted estimators. When the models were developed based on perfectly geo-located data but applied to data with positional errors, model-based estimation was superior to model-assisted estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

ID OCEAN ALTIMETRY; GPS; MULTIPATH; AIRCRAFT
AB GNSS-Reflectometty (GNSS-R) altimetry has demonstrated a strong potential for sea level monitoring. Interference Pattern Technique (IPT) based on the analysis of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) estimated by a GNSS receiver, presents the main advantage of being applicable everywhere by using a single geodetic antenna and receiver, transforming them to real tide gauges. Classical SNR analysis method used to estimate the variations of the reflecting surface height h(t) has a limited domain of validity due to its variation rate dh/dt (t) assumed to be negligible. We present here a significant advance in this altimetric methodology using GNSS multipath to conjointly estimate h(t) and g (0 over areas characterized by high amplitudes of tides and presence of waves. It drastically enhances the temporal and spatial monitoring of tides and waves. Inversion approach is based on a Least Square Method (ISM), combining simultaneous measurements from different GNSS constellations (GPS, GLONASS). Our method is validated with SNR data acquired on an offshore site of 60-meter height, in conditions were assumptions of the classical SNR analysis method are not valid (i.e. with a semi-diurnal tide amplitude of similar to 4 m, vertical velocity of the sea surface due to tide reaching 0.2 mm/s, and presence of waves with amplitude up to few meters). Linear correlation between the estimates with our method and tide gauges records are better than 0.97, whereas it only equals 0.82 with the classical method over the whole 3 months of acquisition. Our dynamic SNR method allows a very good estimate of the main tide periods and permits to detect swell and waves with realistic amplitudes and periods, which is not the case with tide gauges (located in protected areas) or classical SNR analysis method.

AB Lidar remote sensing has emerged as one of the best technologies for mapping aboveground biomass in forest systems. Recent developments in lidar instruments, computer processing power, and algorithm development have enabled the mapping of individual tree structure from lidar remote sensing, yet the utility of individual tree metrics has not been fully explored for aboveground biomass mapping. Conversely, scaling-based approaches using minimal data inputs have recently been presented as an alternative method for mapping regional biomass. We compare these two emerging avenues of lidar-based biomass mapping to plot-aggregated biomass modeling techniques. We assess three forested ecosystems: a mature, closed-canopy deciduous broadleaf forest; a mature evergreen needleleaf forest; and a Loblolly pine plantation with a range of even-aged stands. For individual tree based approaches, individual tree metrics improve explanatory power from R-2 = 057 to R-2 = 0.85 in the mature conifer site, but do not show statistically significant improvements in the other two sites. We suggest that with large field sample plots in areas of open canopy cover, individual tree metrics can significantly improve aboveground biomass (AGBM) estimation as they directly take into account stand density. Regarding scalingbased approaches, we demonstrate that the proposed methods are currently unsuitable at local scales in forests without a tight relationship between canopy top height and basal area, as seen in two of our study areas. Individual tree information shows promise for improving AGBM modeling capabilities, and may also facilitate scalingbased approaches, but further research regarding the application of allometric equations and the spatial scale of models is necessary to continue advancing the field of high-resolution forest biomass accounting.

AB Although mapping activities of urban land change have been widely carried out detailed information on urban development in time over rapid urbanization areas would have been lost in most studies with multi-year intervals. Here we provide a two-stage framework of long-term mapping of urban areas at an annual frequency in Beijing, China, over the period from 1984 to 2013. Classification for each year was carried out initially based on a number of Landsat scenes within that year using spectral information from a base image plus NDVI time series derived from all scenes. A temporal consistency check involving both temporal filtering and heuristic reasoning was then applied to the sequence of classified urban maps for further improvement. We assessed this time-series of urban maps based on two schemes. One is change detection in rapidly developing areas over the past three decades, and the other is accuracy assessment over the whole region in four selected years (i.e., 1984, 1990, 2000 and 2013). Based on validation using independent samples, the 0As (overall accuracies) of these four years are 96%, 93%, 92% and 95%, respectively. Meanwhile, the average accuracy of change detection for all years is 83%. In addition, the proposed temporal consistency check was found to be able to make considerable improvements (about 6%) to the overall accuracies and results of change detection. The resultant urban land sequence revealed that the average growth rates were 47.51 +/- 4.17 km(2)/year, 34.65 +/- 2.90 km(2)/year and 99.48 +/- 1.3 km(2)/year for 1984-1990, 1990-2000 and 2000-2013, respectively.

ID ASSISTED ESTIMATION; STEM VOLUME; HEIGHT; LIDAR; AREA
AB Remote sensing-based change estimation typically takes two forms. Indirect estimation entails constructing models of the relationship between the response variable of interest and remotely sensed auxiliary variables at two times and then estimating change as the differences in the model predictions for the two times. Direct estimation entails constructing models of change directly using observations of change in the response and the remotely sensed auxiliary variables for two dates. The direct method is generally preferred, although few statistically rigorous comparisons have been reported. This study focused on statistically rigorous, indirect and direct estimation of biomass change using forest inventory and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for a Norwegian study area. Three sets of statistical estimators were used: simple random sampling estimators, indirect model-assisted regression estimators, and direct model-assisted regression estimators. In addition, three modeling approaches were used to support the direct model-assisted estimators. The study produced four relevant findings. First, use of the ALS auxiliary information greatly increased the precision of change estimates, regardless of whether indirect or direct methods were used. Second, contrary to previously reported results, the indirect method produced greater precision for the study area mean than the traditional direct method. Third, the direct method that used models whose predictor variables were selected in pairs but with separate coefficient estimates and models whose predictor variables were selected without regard to pairing produced the greatest precision. Finally, greater emphasis should be placed on the effects of model extrapolations for values of independent variables in the population that are beyond the range of the variables in the sample.

AB Glaciers and their changes through time are increasingly obtained from a wide range of satellite sensors. Due to the often remote location of glaciers in inaccessible and high-mountain terrain, satellite observations frequently provide the only available measurements. Furthermore, satellite data provide observations of glacier characteristics that are difficult to monitor using ground-based measurements, thus complementing the latter. In the Glaciers_cci project of the European Space Agency (ESA), three of these characteristics are investigated in detail: glacier area, elevation change and surface velocity. We use (a) data from optical sensors to derive glacier outlines, (b) digital elevation models from at least two points in time, (c) repeat altimetry for determining elevation changes, and (d) data from repeat optical and microwave sensors for calculating surface velocity. For the latter, the two sensor types provide complementary information in terms of spatio-temporal coverage. While (c) and (d) can be generated mostly automatically, (a) and (b) require the intervention of an analyst. Largely based on the results of various round robin experiments (multi-analyst benchmark studies) for each of the products, we suggest and describe the most suitable algorithms for product creation and provide recommendations concerning their practical implementation and the required post-processing. For some of the products (area, velocity) post-processing can influence product quality more than the main-processing algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sea surface temperature retrievals using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer are highly sensitive to cloud cover and coarse mode aerosol particles such as dust. Operationally, techniques are used to flag contaminated retrievals; however, these techniques are less precise in removing dust-contaminated values. A commonly stated metric of quality for SST daytime retrievals is 0.5 degrees C; thus dust contents that produce errors greater than this value should be of concern. Here we report on significant correlation between potential SST error and observed aerosol optical depths (AOD) that was found in the tropical region dominated by Saharan dust. Utilizing a radiative transfer model with variable dust contents and typical vertical distributions, errors greater than the desired 0.5 degrees C accuracy are observed for dust AODs as low as 0.05. Errors of over 1 degrees C occur with 0.25 AOD. Analysis of the AERONET data from Cape Verde, which includes the Saharan Air layer off the west coast of Africa, reveals that 90% of the days during the boreal summer are found to have AOD amounts that correspond to error greater than 0.5 degrees C. We found that a correction accurate within 0.25 degrees C requires a mean accuracy of 0.1 AOD and proper vertical placement of the dust layer within 250 m. While empirical SST retrievals often have some measure of climatological dust contamination built into them, this work shows that typical variability in dust loadings is a non-trivial error source against SST retrieval goals.

AB Identification of clouds, cloud shadows and snow in optical images is often a necessary step toward their use. Recently a new program (named Fmask) designed to accomplish these tasks was introduced for use with images from Landsats 4-7 (Zhu & Woodcock, 2012). In this paper, there are the following: (1) improvements in the Fmask algorithm for Landsats 4-7; (2) a new version for use with Landsat 8 that takes advantage of the new cirrus band; and (3) a prototype algorithm for Sentinel 2 images. Though Sentinel 2 images do not have a thermal band to help with cloud detection, the new cirrus band is found to be useful for detecting clouds, especially for thin cirrus clouds. By adding a new cirrus cloud probability and removing the steps that use the thermal band, the Sentinel 2 scenario achieves significantly better results than the Landsats 4-7 scenario for all 7 images tested. For Landsat 8, almost all the Fmask algorithm components are the same as for Landsats 4-7, except a new cirrus cloud probability is calculated using the new cirrus band, which improves detection of thin cirrus clouds. Landsat 8 results are better than the Sentinel 2 scenario, with 6 out of 7 test images showing higher accuracies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Recent and upcoming launches of new satellite sensors will provide the spatial, spectral and radiometric resolution to globally assess freshwater chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), and thus estimate dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. However, estimating DOC from optical remote sensing requires a robust relationship between CDOM and DOC. This is particularly problematic for reservoirs because they have variable dissolved organic matter composition that complicates the CDOM-DOC relationship. We investigated six manmade reservoirs along a temperate to tropical gradient that represent a range of reservoir types and watershed conditions to determine whether a linear relation between CDOM and DOC could be established. We measured CDOM absorption and DOC concentration during the wet and dry seasons in the six reservoirs. We found the CDOM absorption coefficient and CDOM spectral slope were uncorrelated due to exogenous DOC inputs from multiple sources. Alone, the absorption coefficient of CDOM was a poor predictor of DOC concentration. Including both CDOM absorption coefficient and spectral slope in a multiple regression accounted for both composition and concentration, significantly improving the regression r(2). By using both CDOM absorption coefficient and spectral slope, we identify a framework for a potential solution to overcome the influence of dissolved organic matter source and transformation history on the CDOM-DOC relationship. We conclude that local variability, seasonality and optical complexity should be considered in remote sensing based approaches for global freshwater DOC estimation.

AB The accuracy of snow depth retrieval by remote sensing depends heavily on the characteristics of the snow, and both passive microwave and visible/infrared sensors can contribute to the acquisition of this information. A method integrating these two remotely sensed data sets is presented in this study. Snow depth retrieval is performed using microwave brightness temperature at 19 and 37 GHz from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Image/Sounder (SSMI/S), and visible/infrared surface reflectance from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroadiometer (MODIS) products. Microwave brightness temperature provides information about the volume of snow pack, and visible/infrared surface reflectance can indicate snow presence and surface grain size. With these two remote sensing data sets, snow depth is retrieved by a nonlinear data mining technique, the modified sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm for support vector machine (SVM) regression. The proposed method is tested by using 16,329 records of dry snow measured at 54 meteorological stations in Xinjiang, China over an area of 1.6 million km(2) from 2000 to 2009. The root mean square error (RMSE), relative RMSE and the correlation coefficient of our method are 621 cm, 0.64 and 0.87, respectively. These results are better than those obtained using only brightness temperature data (8.80 cm, 0.90 and 0.73), the traditional spectral polarization difference (SPD) algorithm (15.07 cm, 1.54 and 0.58), a modified Chang algorithm in WESTDC (9.80 cm, 1.00 and 0.62), or the multilayer perceptron classifier of artificial neural networks (ANN) (9.23 cm, 0.94 and 0.72). The daily snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieved by this method has an RMSE of 8.05 mm and a correlation of 0.84, which are better than those of NASA NSIDC (32.87 mm and 0.47) or Globsnow (19.07 mm and 0.59). This study demonstrates that the combination of visible/infrared surface reflectance and microwave brightness temperature via an SVM regression can provide a more accurate retrieval of snow depth.

TI New processing approaches on the retrieval of water levels in Envisat
   and SARAL radar altimetry over rivers: A case study of the <i>Sao

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID SATELLITE ALTIMETRY
AB Radar-based satellite altimetry is well recognized for oceanographic applications. For continental hydrology, its use is complicated by a number of environmental factors such as river width and shape, land cover type in the vicinity of the river banks, and the topography of the relief. These factors make precision vary significantly. Locations where the satellites cross the river can be used as "virtual gauging stations" that can complement the existing network of in situ stations. This article describes processing techniques that take some of these environmental factors (river shape and width) into account to improve the precision of altimetry measurements of the water level. These techniques are based on some a priori information about the river banks and on modeling a phenomenon called "off-nadir hooking". This approach is tested on the Sao Francisco River in Brazil, which for most of its path is considered narrow for satellite altimetry applied to hydrology. Data from Envisat cover the period 2002-2010 while the recently launched SARAL satellite provided data for 2013. The results show that the accuracy varies significantly depending on a number of environmental factors some of which are discussed in depth. In about one-half of the 16 satellite water gauging stations, the RMS errors are lower than 60 cm and in some cases better than 30 cm. These variations could not be directly related to the river width, but appear to be mostly related to the land cover and to the processing chain that often extracts altimetry points from an off-nadir location. All processing is fully described and the results are presented for both the Envisat/RA-2 and SARAL/Altika altimeters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is a plant development indicator that as an input parameter strongly influences several relevant hydrological processes represented in Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Transfer (SVAT) models. Generally, temporal measurement or monitoring of LAI is challenging or even impossible in remote areas. High-temporal resolution remote sensing imaging can be used to estimate LAI from vegetation indices calculated from band ratios. This paper shows the sensitivity of LAI estimation from satellite imaging to atmospheric correction (with ATCOR) and evaluates the effects of LAI uncertainty on water balance modelling. LAI as a SVAT model input parameter was estimated based on the empirical relationship between field measurements, and the vegetation indices NDVI (Normalized-Difference Vegetation Index), SAVI (Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) and SARVI (Soil-Atmosphere Resistant Vegetation Index) for six RapidEye images obtained between 2011 and 2012. In summary, we found that the ATCOR parameter 'visibility' has the strongest influence on LAI estimation. Likewise, atmospherically corrected successive images gathered from around the same time period had low LAI differences (mean absolute difference of 0.09 +/- 0.08) on overlapping image areas. This uncertainty is negligible in SVAT modelling in most cases, thereby allowing mosaicked successive atmospherically corrected images to be used. We showed that LAI uncertainties arising from atmospheric correction (ATCOR 3) can translate into small (LAI +/- 0.1 approximate to evapotranspiration +/- 0.9%, interception +/- 2.5%, evaporation +/- 33%, transpiration +/- 0.7%) to moderate (LAI +/- 0.3 approximate to evapotranspiration +/- 4.1%, interception +/- 7.5%, evaporation +/- 9.9%, transpiration +/- 2.4%) SVAT model uncertainty.

AB Detailed knowledge of forest cover dynamics is crucial for many applications from resource management to ecosystem service assessments. Landsat data provides the necessary spatial, temporal and spectral detail to map and analyze forest cover and forest change processes. With the opening of the Landsat archive, new opportunities arise to monitor forest dynamics on regional to continental scales. In this study we analyzed changes in forest types, forest disturbances, and forest recovery for the Carpathian ecoregion in Eastern Europe. We generated a series of image composites at five year intervals between 1985 and 2010 and utilized a hybrid analysis strategy consisting of radiometric change classification, post-classification comparison and continuous index- and segment-based post-disturbance recovery assessment. For validation of the disturbance map we used a point-based accuracy assessment, and assessed the accuracy of our forest type maps using forest inventory data and statistically sampled ground truth data for 2010. Our Carpathian-wide disturbance map achieved an overall accuracy of 86% and the forest type maps up to 73% accuracy. While our results suggested a small net forest increase in the Carpathians, almost 20% of the forests experienced stand-replacing disturbances over the past 25 years. Forest recovery seemed to only partly counterbalance the widespread natural disturbances and clear-cutting activities. Disturbances were most widespread during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but some areas also exhibited extensive forest disturbances after 2000, especially in the Polish, Czech and Romanian Carpathians. Considerable shifts in forest composition occurred in the Carpathians, with disturbances increasingly affecting coniferous forests, and a relative decrease in coniferous and mixed forests. Both aspects are likely connected to an increased vulnerability of spruce plantations to pests and pathogens in the Carpathians. Overall, our results exemplify the highly dynamic nature of forest cover during times of socio-economic and institutional change, and highlight the value of the Landsat archive for monitoring these dynamics.

AB Himalayan glacier tongues are commonly debris covered and they are an important source of melt water. However, they remain relatively unstudied because of the inaccessibility of the terrain and the difficulties in field work caused by the thick debris mantles. Observations of debris-covered glaciers are therefore scarce and airborne remote sensing may bridge the gap between scarce field observations and coarse resolution space-borne remote sensing. In this study we deploy an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) before and after the melt and monsoon season (May and October 2013) over the debris-covered tongue of the Lirung Glacier in Nepal. Based on stereo-imaging and the structure for motion algorithm we derive highly detailed ortho-mosaics and digital elevation models (DEMs), which we geometrically correct using differential GPS observations collected in the field. Based on DEM differencing and manual feature tracking we derive the mass loss and the surface velocity of the glacier at a high spatial accuracy. On average, mass loss is limited and the surface velocity is very small. However, the spatial variability of melt rates is very high, and' ice cliffs and supra-glacial ponds show mass losses that can be an order of magnitude higher than the average. We suggest that future research should focus on the interaction between supra-glacial ponds, ice cliffs and englacial hydrology to further understand the dynamics of debris-covered glaciers. Finally, we conclude that UAV deployment has large potential in glaciology and it may revolutionize methods currently applied in studying glacier surface features.

AB Emerging near-surface remote sensing techniques have advanced our ability to monitor forest canopy phenology. Thus far, however, little effort has been made to monitor the phenologies of the various canopies of multilayer forests separately, despite their importance in regulating forest biogeochemical cycles. Here we report phenological changes in multi-layer canopies of deciduous broadleaf and evergreen needleleaf forests in the Republic of Korea during the spring of 2013. We installed light-emitting diode (LED) sensors at four different canopy heights at two sites to measure the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using red and near-infrared (NIR) spectral reflectance and to estimate leaf area index (LAI) using the blue band gap fraction. LED-sensors identified leaf-out dates of over- and understory canopies at both sites; leaves unfolded 8-11 days earlier in the understory canopy than the overstory canopy. At the deciduous forest site, LED-NDVI failed to capture the leaf-out date in the overstory canopy, because all four LED-sensors started to see green-up from the understory canopy while the overstory canopy was leafless. LED-LAI identified different leaf-out dates for the over- and understory canopy, because the gap fraction was measured explicitly for each canopy layer. In the evergreen forest site, LED-NDVI signals between the top of the tower and beneath the overstory canopy were decoupled because of the dense evergreen overstory canopy. Both LED-NDVI and LED-LAI identified new needle expansion in the overstory canopy and understory canopy development. MODIS NDVI agreed well with LED-NDVI data (R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 0.04) at the deciduous forest site, and we discovered that understory canopy development determined the onset of greenness based on MODIS NDVI data. LED-LAI data agreed well with independent estimates from the other instruments, indicating that LED-sensors could be used to monitor multi-layer canopy LAI. Continuous, in-situ observation of multi-layer canopy phenology will aid in the interpretation of satellite remote sensing phenology products and improve land surface models that adopt a multi-layer canopy model.

AB The Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) aboard the International Space Station has offered for the first time a dedicated space-borne hyperspectral sensor specifically designed for remote sensing of the coastal environment. However, several processing steps are required to convert calibrated top-of-atmosphere radiances to the desired geophysical parameter(s). These steps add various amounts of uncertainty that can cumulatively render the geophysical parameter imprecise and potentially unusable if the objective is to analyze trends and/or seasonal variability. This research presented here has focused on: (1) atmospheric correction of HICO imagery; (2) retrieval of bathymetry using an improved implementation of a shallow water inversion algorithm; (3) propagation of uncertainty due to environmental noise through the bathymetry retrieval process; (4) issues relating to consistent geo-location of HICO imagery necessary for time series analysis, and; (5) tide height corrections of the retrieved bathymetric dataset The underlying question of whether a temporal change in depth is detectable above uncertainty is also addressed. To this end, nine HICO images spanning November 2011 to August 2012, over the Shark Bay World Heritage Area, Western Australia, were examined. The results presented indicate that precision of the bathymetric retrievals is dependent on the shallow water inversion algorithm used. Within this study, an average of 70% of pixels for the entire HICO-derived bathymetry dataset achieved a relative uncertainty of less than +/- 20%. A per-pixel t-test analysis between derived bathymetry images at successive timestamps revealed observable changes in depth to as low as 0.4 m. However, the present geolocation accuracy of HICO is relatively poor and needs further improvements before extensive time series analysis can be performed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Hot surfaces associated with volcanoes, wild fires and geothermal areas are often thermally heterogeneous with respect to the spatial resolution of satellite sensors. A single pixel temperature derived from a satellite image can therefore represent a continuum of surface temperatures that may vary by hundreds of degrees Celsius. For thermally mixed pixels it is therefore more meaningful to estimate radiant flux [Watts] and/or radiant exitance [Watts per metre squared]. Here we introduce a new method for calculating radiant flux from thermally heterogeneous surfaces with temperatures in the 100 to 1100 degrees C range. It involves modelling radiance spectra using a spectral library. Two spectral libraries were created to represent two different sensor configurations i) a VNIR-SWIR imaging spectrometer and ii) a two channel SWIR imager, both characterized by a 30 m spatial resolution. We compare our approach against that of the "dual-band method". The spectral library approach was able to calculate radiant flux to within 30% of the actual value for targets radiating at or above 0.7 MW (i.e. when using an imaging spectrometer) or 7.1 MW (i.e. when using just two SWIR wavebands). The dual-band approach, on the other hand, required targets to be radiating at least 12 MW before a 30% accuracy level could be obtained. All of the approaches could accurately fit the spectral radiance values that they modelled. However, they could not reliably determine subpixel temperature distributions. This indicates that it might never be possible to retrieve subpixel temperature distributions reliably using short-wave infrared spectra alone. This finding has significant implications for the remote sensing of hot targets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A glacier tongue, the terminus of a glacier projecting out from the coastline and floating over the ocean, experiences vertical deflection due to the fluctuation of ocean tide. Accurate analysis of the tidal deflection of a glacier tongue is necessary to understand the elastic properties and dynamics of glacial ice. We extracted the tidal deflection of Campbell Glacier Tongue (CGT), one of the fast-flowing glacier tongues in East Antarctica, by using 120 Double-Differential Interferometric SAR (DDInSAR) images from the 16 COSMO-SkyMed one-day tandem interferometric SAR image pairs obtained during 2010 and 2011.A map of tide deflection ratio (alpha-map), defined as the ratio of the tidal deflection over tide height, was generated by pixel-based linear regression between the DDInSAR-derived tidal deflection and the tidal variation predicted by various tide models such as TPXO7.1, FES2004, CATS2008a and Ross_Inv after the inverse barometer effect correction. We also generated the maps of R-2, root mean square error (RMSE), and intercept (beta) of the linear regression model. We confirmed that the horizontal flow of the Campbell Glacier is steady over the whole data acquisition period due to the fact that alpha values were close to zero over the grounded part of the glacier. Ross_Inv provided the most reliable alpha-map with the highest R-2 (0.97) and the smallest RMSE (03 cm) beyond the hinge zone than other tide models. The spatial variation of the tidal response of the whole CGT was clearly defined from the alpha-map. The grounding line retreated by 0.3-1.5 km in comparison with that in 1996 defined by Rignot et al., 2011a. The ice thickness of CGT was estimated to be 397 +/- 71 m from ICESat surface elevation data. The Young's modulus of CGT was found to be 0.5-1.3 GPa (0.8 GPa at an ice thickness of 397 m) by simulating the alpha in the hinge zone using a 2-dimensional finite element method.

AB Massive groundwater extraction is common throughout Mexico and is well known to result in land subsidence. However, most land subsidence surveys focus on one single city, mainly Mexico City, and thus fail to reveal the regional extent of the problem. Here we use 2007-2011 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series analysis of ALOS data to resolve land subsidence in the entire central Mexico region. We identify land subsidence in 21 areas, including 17 cities. Linear vertical rates over 30 cm/yr are observed in Mexico City, while in the other locations rates of 5-10 cm/yr are detected. We define 3 main categories of subsidence using the averaged velocity maps in conjunction with previously published structural, surface geology, and land use mapping: (1) rapid, large-scale subsidence, (2) rapid, local-scale subsidence, and (3) slow, patchy subsidence. The correlation between subsidence and land use confirms that groundwater extraction mainly for agricultural and urban activities is the main cause of land subsidence. We observe that the boundaries of the subsiding areas are typically characterized by high velocity gradients often coinciding with pre-existing faults, motion on these faults being driven by water extraction rather than by tectonic activity. Regional surveys of this type are necessary to understand the spatial and temporal evolution of land subsidence, to constrain the distribution and connectivity of water-bearing units, and ultimately to reach better hazard mitigation plans.

AB Standard ocean color data products from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) are compared with equivalent regional products in European seas exhibiting different bio-optical properties: the northern Adriatic Sea, the Baltic Sea and the Western Black Sea (ADRS, BLTS and BLKS, respectively). Investigated quantities are: 1) the algal-2 pigment index, alg2; 2) the composite-absorption coefficient of yellow substance and non-pigmented particles at 442 nm, a(dg); and 3) the concentration of the total suspended matter, TSM. Regional data products are created using ocean color inversion schemes based on MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) neural nets trained with field measurements from the Coastal Atmosphere and Sea Time Series (CoASTS) and Bio-Optical mapping of Marine Properties (BiOMaP) programs. MLP input is the remote sensing reflectance Res at MERIS center-wavelengths specifically selected for different water types in view of minimizing the perturbing effects of inaccurate atmospheric correction on the retrieval of regional data products. A new method is also proposed to define the applicability of regional MLPs to input Res. Results indicate that MERIS alg2 values tend to overestimate the equivalent quantity computed with MLP regional algorithms. The agreement between MERIS and regional TSM data products is significantly better than that reported for alg2 and ad, especially for BLKS. Findings highlight the relevance of using regional inversion schemes to evaluate standard products over extended oceanographic regions as a complement to the analysis of match-ups between marine products measured in situ and derived from space-born data.

TI High nonlinear urban ground motion in Manila (Philippines) from 1993 to

AB In coastal low-lying urban areas, vertical ground motions can significantly exacerbate the hazards related to sea-level rise. However, their spatial extent, their temporal evolution, and even sometimes their existence are often poorly known. This study aims to monitor variable urban ground motion (uplift and subsidence) from 1993 to 2010 in the metropolitan area of Manila, Philippines. Because high subsidence rates have been reported in this city in previous studies, conventional Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) was applied with an adapted stacking procedure to the archive of ERS and Envisat satellite images to produce surface deformation-velocity maps for different periods. The results showed that the city is locally affected by vertical ground motions on the order of 15 cm/yr. Moreover, the spatio-temporal evolution of the ground-motion phenomena is highly nonlinear. These results are in good agreement with previous studies focused on groundwater use in Manila and in the Marikina Fault Valley, suggesting a plausible interpretation of the processes causing surface motion. Incidentally, the ground motions are affecting the locations of several geodetic instruments, including a tide gauge with sea-level records starting in 1902, two permanent GPS (Global Positioning System) stations, and a DORIS (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite) station. A major implication of those large and locally variable ground motions is that they impede the use of the nearby GPS and DORIS data to correct the tide-gauge records and to derive robust sea-level trends associated with climate change.

AB Degradation of grassland has become a worldwide environmental concern. This study examined temporal and spatial patterns of grassland potential productivity dynamics between 2000 and 2010 within community pastures (CPs) in Saskatchewan Canada. Data used in the study included Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m time-series NDVI, accumulated precipitation (A-PPT) from September to August and annual stocking intensity (SI). We conducted Mann-Kendall analysis on grassland growing season NDVI (GS-NDVI), A-PPT and SI to demonstrate spatial variation in their temporal trends at local and regional scales. We developed both global Ordinary Linear Square (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models to analyze the impacts of climate variation and human activities such as grazing practice on potential pasture productivity from both temporal and spatial contexts. Results show that grasslands in most CPs had increasing trends in GS-NDVI for the time period, and no significantly decreasing trend was found over all CPs at the regional or ecoregional scales. A-PPT itself accounted for over 96% of inter-annual variation in grassland NDVI. At the regional level, the temporal trends in A-PPT and stocking intensity were more significant factors in accounting for spatial variation of NDVI than were A-PPT and SI per se. Results show that the past adopted grazing intensities did not significantly influence grassland potential productivity at either temporal or spatial scales in the study area.

AB Airborne multispectral remote sensing devices have been used in automatic identification of tree species, and the spatial and spectral properties of the sensors affect the remote sensing measurement results. Previous work based on a simulation model with ground-level measured reflectance data of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.), and birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh. and Betula pendula Roth) tree species and idealized Leica ADS80 sensitivities suggested that the addition of a fifth sensitivity band in the red edge wavelength region to the existing Leica ADS80 system significantly improves the classification performance. In this paper, we extend this analysis using a simulated model with accurate spectral sensitivity information and airborne AisaEAGLE II hyperspectral data for these three tree species. We simulated multispectral responses using spectral sensitivity characteristics of the Leica ADS40, the Vexcel UltraCam-D, the Intergraph-Z/I Digital mapping camera and the Leica ADS40 system with an added band in the 691-785 nm region. We evaluated the tree species classification performance of these simulated responses using Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The classification experiment result showed that the simulated responses of the 5-band multispectral system yielded the most robust classification performance with approximately 98% accuracy. This result was similar to the accuracy obtained with the hyperspectral data. Although differences were observed in the sensitivity functions of the 4-band systems, there were no large differences observed in the classification performances between them. With the simulated 5-band system, there was an increase of 5-13% points in classification accuracy when compared to the accuracies of the 4-band systems. The results obtained via proposed 5-band system support results from previous studies suggesting that there is a need for a sensitivity band in the red edge wavelength region for applications in tree species classification.

AB We analyze the surface emissivity and radar backscatter measured by the Aquarius L-band radiometer and scatterometer under rainy conditions. The residual signals due to rain are derived from measurements after accounting for roughness due to wind and flat surface emissivity. The wind roughness is accounted for by a geophysical model function (GMF) built using rain-free data. Using more than one year of Aquarius data collocated with SSMI/S, WindSAT rain rate and NCEP wind, our analysis reveals rain rate dependence in radar backscatter and surface emissivity, which become increasingly significant as the wind speed approaches zero and not significant above 15 m s(-1). The effect of rain on radar backscatter is dominated by raindrop splashing as indicated by the incidence angle dependence and polarization characteristics of the residuals. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ID CANOPY COVER; ILLUMINATION; POPULATION
AB Canopy cover and canopy closure are two closely related measures of vegetation structure. They are used for estimating understory light conditions and their influence on a broad range of biological components in forest ecosystems, from the demography and population dynamics of individual species to community structure. Angular canopy closure is more closely related to the direct and indirect light experienced by a plant or an animal than vertical canopy cover, but more challenging to estimate. We used airborne laser scanner (ALS) data to estimate canopy cover for 210 5-m radius vegetation plots in semi-open habitats and forests in protected nature areas in Denmark. The method was based on the area of Thiessen (Voronoi) polygons generated from the ALS points. We also estimated angular canopy closure by transforming ALS points from Cartesian to spherical coordinates, and calculating the percentage of azimuth and zenith angle intervals which contained points. We compared these estimates with field-based estimates using densiometer for 60 vegetation plots in forest. Finally, we compared ALS-based estimates of canopy cover and canopy closure to field-based estimates of understory light, based on the average Ellenberg indicator values for light for the plant species present in a given plot. The correlations of Ellenberg values with ALS-based canopy closure were higher (r(2): 0.47) than those with ALS-based canopy cover (r(2): 026) and densiometer readings (r(2): 0.41) for the forest sites. ALS-based canopy closure is thus a reasonable indicator of understory light availability and has the advantage over field-based methods that it can be rapidly estimated for extensive areas.

AB The aim of this study is to analyze the suitability of remotely-sensed aerosol retrievals to progress in the understanding of the influence of desert dust on health, and particularly on meningitis epidemics. In the Sahel, meningitis epidemics are a serious public health issue. Social factors are of prime importance in the dynamics of the epidemics, however climate and environmental factors are also suspected to play an important role.
   This study focuses on three Sahelian countries (Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger) which are among the most concerned in the "meningitis belt" and affected by strong dust events every year. It investigates the capability of the aerosol index (AI) derived from OMI (ozone monitoring instrument) to represent the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and the aerosol surface concentration (particulate matter <10 mu m; PM10) at different time-steps. The comparison of the OMI-AI with ground-based measurements of AOT shows a good agreement at a daily time-step (R approximate to 0.7). The correlation between OMI-AI and PM10 measurements is lower (R approximate to 03) but it increases at a weekly time-step (R approximate to 0.5). The difference in the level of correlation between the AOT and the PM10 is partly related to changes in the altitude of the dust layers, especially from April to June, the period of transition from the dry to the wet season. A temporal shift is observed in the occurrence of the maximum of PM10 concentration (March), of AOT (April) and of OMI-AI (June). Nevertheless, during the core of the dry season (January to March) when dust is transported at low altitude, the OMI-AI is able to correctly detect the dust events and to reproduce the dust variability at the regional scale.
   For dust impact studies on health, only the surface level is relevant. Thus, we conclude that the OMI-AI is suitable especially at a weekly time-step from January to March. In particular for meningitis impact studies, it appears as suitable from the onset to the maximum of the epidemics.

AB A crop yield estimation model using time-series MODIS WDRVI was developed. The main feature of the proposed model is the incorporation of crop phenology detection using MODIS data, called the "Shape-Model Fitting Method". MODIS WDRVI taken 7-10 days before the corn silking stage had strong linear correlation with corn final grain yield at both field and regional scales. The model revealed spatial patterns of corn final grain yield all over the U.S. from 2000 to 2011. State-level corn yield was estimated accurately with coefficient of variation below 10% especially for the 18 major corn producing states including Iowa, Illinois, Delaware, Minnesota, Ohio, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Nebraska, Kentucky, New York, South Dakota, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, New Jersey and Maryland. The results corresponded well with the spatial pattern of high-yield regions derived from the USDA/NASS data. However, the model tended to underestimate corn grain yield in three irrigated regions: the Midwestern region depending on the Ogallala Aquifer, the downstream basin of the Mississippi, and the southwestern region of Georgia. In contrast, it tended to overestimate corn grain yield around the outlying regions of the U.S. Corn Belt, specifically, the East Coast, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Missouri. The estimation accuracy of the proposed model differed depending on the region. However, the annual variation of state level corn grain yield could be detected with high accuracy, especially in the major corn producing states. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Optical data collected in coastal waters off South Florida and in the Caribbean Sea between January 2009 and December 2010 were used to evaluate products derived with three bio-optical inversion algorithms applied to MODIS/Aqua, MODIS/Terra, and SeaWiFS satellite observations. The products included the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d_490) and for the visible range (K-d_PAR), and euphotic depth (Z(eu), corresponding to 1% of the surface incident photosynthetically available radiation or PAR). Above-water hyperspectral reflectance data collected over optically shallow waters of the Florida Keys between June 1997 and August 2011 were used to help understand algorithm performance over optically shallow waters. The in situ data covered a variety of water types in South Florida and the Caribbean Sea, ranging from deep clear waters, turbid coastal waters, and optically shallow waters (K-d_490 range of similar to 0.03-1.29 m(-1)). An algorithm based on Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) showed the best performance (RMSD<13% and R-2 similar to 1.0 for MODIS/Aqua and SeaWiFS). Two algorithms based on empirical regressions performed well for offshore clear waters, but underestimated K-d_490 and K-d_PAR in coastal waters due to high turbidity or shallow bottom contamination. Similar results were obtained when only in situ data were used to evaluate algorithm performance. The excellent agreement between satellite-derived remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and in situ R-rs suggested that the different product uncertainties resulted primarily from algorithm inversion as opposed to atmospheric correction. A simple empirical model was developed to derive Z(eu), from K-d_490 for satellite measurements of nearshore waters. MODIS/Aqua gave the best results in general relative to in situ observations. Our findings lay the basis for synoptic time-series studies of water quality in coastal ecosystems, yet more work is required to minimize the bottom interference in the Florida Keys optically shallow waters.

AB MODIS 250-m NDVI and EVI datasets are now regularly used to classify regional-scale agricultural land-use practices in many different regions of the globe, especially in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, where rapid land-use change due to agricultural development has attracted considerable interest from researchers and policy makers. Variation exists in which MODIS datasets are used, how they are processed for analysis, and what ground reference data are used. Moreover, various land-use/land-cover classes are ultimately resolved, and as yet, crop-specific classifications (e.g. soy-corn vs. soy-cotton double crop) have not been reported in the literature, favoring instead generalized classes such as single vs. double crop. The objective of this study is to present a rigorous multiyear evaluation of the applicability of time-series MODIS 250-m VI data for crop classification in Mato Grosso, Brazil. This study shows progress toward more refined crop-specific classification, but some grouping of crop classes remains necessary. It employs a farm field polygon-based ground reference dataset that is unprecedented in spatial and temporal coverage for the state, consisting of 2003 annual field site samples representing 415 unique field sites and five crop years (2005-2009). This allows for creation of a dataset containing "best-case" or "pure" pixels, which we used to test class separability in a multiyear cross validation framework applied to boosted decision tree classifiers trained on MODIS data subjected to different pre-processing treatments. Reflecting the agricultural landscape of Mato Grosso as a whole, cropping practices represented in the ground reference dataset largely involved soybeans, and soy-based classes (primarily double crop 'soy-commercial' and single crop 'soy-cover') dominated the analysis along with cotton and pasture. With respect to the MODIS data treatments, the best results were obtained using date-of-acquisition interpolation of the 16-day composite VI time series and outlier point screening, for which five-year out-of-sample accuracies were consistently near or above 80% and Kappa values were above 0.60. It is evident that while much additional research is required to fully and reliably differentiate more specific crop classes, particular groupings of cropping strategies are separable and useful for a number of applications, including studies of agricultural intensification and extensification in this region of the world.

AB Significant advances have been made in ocean color remote sensing of turbidity and water clarity for estuarine waters, yet accurate estimations of chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chla in mg m(-3)) has been problematic, posing a challenge to the research community and an obstacle to managers for long-term water quality assessment. Here, a novel empirical Chla algorithm based on a Red-Green-Chorophyll-Index (RGCI) was developed and validated for MODIS and SeaWiFS observations between 1998 and 2011. The algorithm showed robust performance with two independent datasets, with relative mean uncertainties of similar to 30% and similar to 50% and RMS uncertainties of similar to 40% and similar to 65%, respectively, for Chla ranging between 1.0 and >30.0 mg m(-3). These uncertainties are comparable or even lower than those reported for the global open oceans when traditional blue-green band ratio algorithms are used.
   A long-term Chla time series generated from SeaWiFS and MODIS observations showed excellent agreement between sensors and with in situ measurements. Substantial variability in both space and time was observed in the four bay segments, with higher Chla in the upper bay segments and lower Chla in the lower bay segments, and higher Chla in the wet season and lower Chla in the dry season. On average, river discharge could explain similar to 60% of the seasonal changes and similar to 90% of the inter-annual changes, with the latter mainly driven by climate variability (e.g. El Nino and La Nina years) and anomaly events (e.g. tropical cyclones). Significant positive correlation was found between monthly mean Chla anomalies and monthly Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI) (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.43, p<0.01, N = 147), with high Chla associated with El Nino and lower Chla associated with La Nina. Further, a Water Quality Decision Matrix (WQDM) was established from satellite observations, providing complementary and more reliable information to the existing WQDM based on less synoptic and less frequent field measurements. The satellite-derived WQDM and long-term time-series data support the decision making efforts of the management agencies that regulate nutrient discharge to the bay. Similar approaches may be established for other estuaries where field data are much more limited than for Tampa Bay. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Maintaining the ecological diversity and hydrologic connectivity of freshwater delta systems depends on regular recharge of floodplains with river water, which can be difficult to observe on the ground. Rivers that form deltas often carry large amounts of suspended sediment, but floodplain lakes and wetlands usually have little sediment in suspension. Remote observation of high sediment water in lakes and wetlands therefore often indicates connectivity with the river network. In this study, we use daily 250-m MODIS imagery in band 1 (620-670 nm) and band 2 (841-876 nm) to monitor suspended sediment transport and, by proxy, hydrologic recharge in the Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada. To identify an appropriate suspended sediment concentration (SSC)-reflectance model, we compare 31 published empirical equations using a field dataset containing 147 observations of SSC and in situ spectral reflectance. Results suggest potential for spatial transferability of such models, but success is contingent on the equation meeting certain criteria: 1) use of a near infrared band in combination with at least one visible band, 2) development based on SSCs similar to those in the observed region, and 3) a nonlinear form. Using a highly predictive SSC-reflectance model (Spearman's rho = 0.95), we develop a twelve-year time series of SSC in the westernmost end of Lake Athabasca, observe the timing and sources of major sediment flux events, and identify a threshold river discharge of similar to 1700 m(3)/s above which SSC in Lake Athabasca is clearly associated with flow in the Athabasca River. We also track the influx of Athabasca River water to floodplain lakes, and in three of the lakes identify distinct discharge thresholds (1040 m(3)/s, 1150 m(3)/s, and 1850 m(3)/s) which result in lake recharge. For each of these lakes, we find a statistically significant decline in the threshold exceedence frequency since 1970, suggesting less frequent recharge during the summer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
