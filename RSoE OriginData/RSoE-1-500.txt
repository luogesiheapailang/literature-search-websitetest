AB Drought events have a major impact on vegetation structure and function. Recently, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been widely used to understand the photosynthesis rates of vegetation under drought stress conditions. However, it is still unclear whether the reduction in SIF shown under drought stress conditions is regulated by physiological or structural factors. To understand the underlying reduction mechanism of SIF under drought stress, we conducted an experiment under a drought condition using one-year-old Prunus yedoensis seedlings. We compared the experiment trees with control trees that were not exposed to drought stress. We collected spectral and gas exchange data to monitor physiological changes and scanned the trees with a terrestrial laser scanner to monitor the structural changes. The discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) and Fluspect models were used to simulate canopy-level SIF. We found that drought stress caused leaf-level steadystate fluorescence yield to increase, while maximum photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and the quantum yield of Photosystem II decreased significantly. Regarding the canopy structural changes, the leaf inclination angle distribution of the experiment trees gradually turned toward erectophile over time (55.2 & PLUSMN; 9.3 degrees to 74.7 & PLUSMN; 6.0 degrees; mean & PLUSMN; standard deviation), whereas that of the control trees remained relatively constant (52.9 & PLUSMN; 8.8 degrees). Furthermore, reduction of crown cover of the experiment trees was 3-fold (77.4 & PLUSMN; 9.8%) compared with the control trees (26.0 & PLUSMN; 16.2%). The simulated nadir-view canopy-level SIF of the experiment trees was reduced 2.8-fold compared to the control trees. These findings, obtained specifically from Prunus yedoensis seedlings, indicate that canopy-level SIF reduced due to the canopy structural changes, although leaf-level fluorescence yield increased. Therefore, canopy structural changes should be considered when attempting to understand SIF reduction in drought conditions.

AB The twin Sentinel-3 satellites have multi-band radiometers which observe in methane-sensitive shortwave infrared bands with daily global coverage and 500 m ground pixel resolution. We investigate the methane observation capability of Sentinel-3 and how its coverage-resolution combination fits between Sentinel-5p and Sentinel-2 within a tiered observation approach for methane leak monitoring. Sentinel-5p measures methane with high precision and daily global coverage, allowing worldwide leak detection but with a coarse spatial resolution of 7 km x 5.5 km. The Sentinel-2 twin satellites have multi-band instruments that can identify source locations of major leaks (> 1 t/h) with their methane observations of 20 m resolution under favorable observational conditions, but these satellites lack daily global coverage.We show that methane enhancements can be retrieved from the shortwave infrared band measurements of Sentinel-3. We report the lowest emission detections by Sentinel-3 in the 8-20 t/h range, depending on location and wind conditions. We demonstrate Sentinel-3's capability of identification and monitoring of methane leaks using two case studies. Near Moscow, Sentinel-3 shows that two major short-term leaks, separated by 30 km, occurred simultaneously at a gas pipeline and appear as a single methane plume in Sentinel-5p data. For another Sentinel-5p leak detection near the Hassi Messaoud oil/gas field in Algeria, Sentinel-3 identifies the leaking facility emitting continuously for 6 days, and Sentinel-2 pinpoints the source of the leak at an oil/gas well. Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 also show the 6-day leak was followed by a four-month period of burning of the leaking gas, suggesting a gas well blowout to be the cause of the leak. We find similar source rate quantifications from plume detections by Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 for these leaks, demonstrating Sentinel-3's utility for emission quantification. We show that zooming in with Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-2 in synergy allows precise identification, quantification, and monitoring of the sources corresponding to methane plumes observed in Sentinel-5p's global scans.

ID WATER-LEVEL; TIBETAN PLATEAU; ICE; CRYOSAT-2; EVOLUTION; SURFACE
AB Satellite altimetry is currently one of the most widely used techniques for monitoring lake water levels. Raw altimetry measurements are generally delivered in an ellipsoid height system, while lake heights are finally required in a local level height system to ensure the lake surface being strictly flat under the physical constraints of both gravity and non-gravity factors. Therefore, there is always a need for height system transformation of altimetry data. Many of the previous studies have used orthometric heights in an approximate manner in the altimetric data processing. The geoid errors, together with other error sources, can introduce significant biases into water level estimations. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal regression method to calculate orthometric height to level height (O2L) differences, which can be used to yield accurate lake levels from satellite altimetry data. In the experiments conducted in this study, we chose ICESat-2 data to train the O2L bias correction model, and evaluated the algorithm performance on two large lakes in central Asian (Issyk-Kul and Baikal lakes) and one lake in North America (Lake Michigan). The experimental results indicate that the spatiotemporal modeling method performs better than the traditional spatial modeling method in terms of regression accuracy, and the water levels derived from the new method are much closer to in-situ gauging measurements. Influenced by O2L bias, there is often a jitter phenomenon in the time series of lake levels, and the results of different satellites are, accordingly, not mutually consistent. A visual analysis reveals that the spatio-temporal modeling method can greatly reduce the high-frequency bias.

AB Over large areas, land cover classification has conventionally been undertaken using satellite time series. Typically temporal metric percentiles derived from single pixel location time series have been used to take advantage of spectral differences among land cover classes over time and to minimize the impact of missing observations. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated potential for land cover classification of single date images. However, over large areas and using time series their application is complicated because they are sensitive to missing observations and they may misclassify small and spatially fragmented surface features due to their spatial patch-based implementation. This study demonstrates, for the first time, a one-dimensional (1D) CNN single pixel time series land classification approach that uses temporal percentile metrics and that does not have these issues. This is demonstrated for all the Conterminous United States (CONUS) considering two different 1D CNN structures with 5 and 8 layers, respectively. CONUS 30 m land cover classifications were derived using all the available Landsat-5 and -7 imagery over a seven-month growing season in 2011 with 3.3 million 30 m land cover class labelled samples extracted from the contemporaneous CONUS National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 16 class land cover product. The 1D CNNs and, a conventional random forest model, were trained using 10%, 50% and 90% samples, and the classification accuracies were evaluated with an independent 10% proportion. Temporal metrics were classified using 5, 7 and 9 percentiles for each of five Landsat reflective wavelength bands and their eight band ratios. The CONUS and detailed 150 x 150 km classification results demonstrate that the approach is effective at scale and locally. The 1D CNN classification land cover class boundaries were preserved for small axis dimension features, such as roads and rivers, with no stripes or anomalous spatial patterns. The 8-layer 1D CNN provided the highest overall classification accuracies and both the 5-layer and 8-layer 1D CNN architectures provided higher accuracies than the random forest by 1.9% - 2.8% which as all the accuracies were > 83% is a meaningful increase. The CONUS overall classification accuracies increased marginally with the number of percentiles (86.21%, 86.40%, and 86.43% for 5, 7 and 9 percentiles, respectively) using the 8-layer 1D-CNN. Class specific producer and user accuracies were quantified, with lower accuracies for the developed land, crop and pasture/hay classes, but no systematic pattern among classes with respect to the number of temporal percentiles used. Application of the trained model to a different year of CONUS Landsat ARD showed moderately decreased accuracy (80.79% for 7 percentiles) that we illustrate is likely due to different intra-annual surface variations between years. These encouraging results are discussed with recommended research for deep learning using temporal metric percentiles.

AB Despite the myriad of remote sensing techniques currently used to map surface water, a gap remains in our ability to rapidly map inundation from flooding at the required temporal resolution to understand how floods evolve. However, the recent launch of constellations of Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSSR) satellites can provide data at a more frequent temporal repeat than a single satellite. These L-band instruments could provide moderate spatial resolution inundation maps at a better temporal resolution than other satellite radars. This paper describes a retrieval algorithm for flood inundation mapping using GNSS-R data from the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) constellation. The algorithm employs a simple dielectric model to retrieve fractional inundation from an observation of reflectivity, requiring parameterizations of soil surface and water roughness as well as ancillary soil moisture data. Here, we give a brief overview of the model, describe our parameterization scheme, and present inundation maps using CYGNSS data. We describe four case studies (from the Amazon, Mozambique, Mali, and Australia) and compare the CYGNSS inundation maps to other surface water data (SWAMPS, PALSAR-2, Dartmouth Flood Observatory, MODIS, and the Global Surface Water Explorer). We identify sources of uncertainty in the CYGNSS inundation maps and discuss possible reasons for discrepancies between the inundation retrievals. We introduce the data portal, which houses the CYGNSS inundation maps, for use by the science community.

AB Spatially explicit information on crop distribution is essential for market information, food security, and agri-cultural sustainability. However, high-resolution crop maps are unavailable for most countries of the world. In this study, we developed an operational workflow and produced the first openly-available 10-m resolution maize and soybean map over China. We also derived area estimates for maize and soybean extent for 2019 using a stratified, two-stage, cluster sampling design and ground data collected for the entire country. We developed a multi-scale, multi-temporal procedure for mapping, in which field data were used as training to map maize and soybean over the first-stage sample of 10 km x 10 km equal-area blocks with PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 data. Then, the classified blocks were used as training to map maize and soybean for the country with wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 data using a random forests approach. We used all available Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data ac-quired between April and October 2019, applied quality assurance, including cloud and shadow masking, and created monthly image composites as inputs for the random forests analysis. We derived maize and soybean area estimates using the field sample data and a regression estimator. Utilizing the probability output layer of the random forests models, we found and applied empirical probability thresholds that matched map-based crop area estimates with sample-based area estimates. Maize area in China in 2019 was estimated to be 330,609 +/- 34,109 km2 (+/- value is the standard error), and soybean area was estimated to be 78,107 +/- 12,969 km2. Validated using the field sample data as reference, our crop map had an overall accuracy of 91.8 +/- 1.2%. The user's and pro-ducer's accuracies for the maize class were 93.9 +/- 2.5% and 79.2 +/- 3.6%, and for the soybean class were 63.6 +/- 12.1% and 61.9 +/- 11.8%. Our map-based maize and soybean area estimates had close agreement with gov-ernment reports at the provincial and prefectural levels, with r2 of 0.90 and 0.92 for maize, and 0.93 and 0.94 for soybean, respectively. Our workflow can generate internally consistent results for crop area estimation and crop mapping simultaneously. As Sentinel-2 data are being acquired consistently and very-high-resolution commercial satellite data are increasingly available, our established workflow may be applied in an operational setting for annual crop mapping in China and other countries.

AB The Lancang-Mekong River (LMR) is an important transboundary river in Southeast Asia shared by China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam from upstream to downstream. Construction and operation of dams in the LMR basin has profoundly affected its natural streamflow regime. It is therefore important to monitor changes in reservoir water storage and to quantify the impact of reservoir operation on the redistribution of surface water resources over this basin. Given the difficulty in obtaining in-situ measurements of reservoirs on the LMR, we integrated multisource remote sensing, including satellite altimetry and optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, to generate weekly water levels and water storages of nine largest reservoirs on the main stem of the LMR from 2017 to 2021. Specifically, partial surface water extent (SWE) of reservoirs was extracted from Sentinel-1 SAR images and digital elevation models (DEMs), using Random Forest algorithms trained by partial SWE derived from Sentinel-2 optical images, showing an overall accuracy higher than 95%. Based on the partial SWE and water level estimates from ICESat-2 and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI, International Space Station-based) data, the relationships between water levels and partial SWE were derived to convert partial SWE into water level time series. Furthermore, water storage time series of the nine reservoirs were obtained from water level time series and hypsometric functions derived from SRTM DEMs that were corrected by ICESat-2 data to remove systematic errors. For the Xiaowan Reservoir on the Lancang River, there is close agreement between remote sensing-derived water levels and in-situ water levels in terms of a normalized RMSE lower than 5%. Results indicate that multisource remote sensing has large potential for high-temporal-resolution monitoring of reservoir water levels and water storage. This could more precisely evaluate impacts of cascade reservoirs on the streamflow of the LMR and facilitate drought and flood mitigation for riverine countries.

AB More accurate and process-based satellite evapotranspiration (ET) estimation for the Tibetan Plateau (TP)-the Third Pole of the world-have long been of major interest in hydrometeorology. Combining recent advances in satellite-based ET mechanistic algorithms and data-oriented methods allows ET hybrid modeling by coupling physical constraints with machine learning (ML). Specifically, we developed two hybrid models, a surface conductance-based ML model (ML-Gs) and a soil evaporation-based ML model (ML-Es), to estimate regional ET on the TP. These hybrid models have biophysical framework, under which one of the parameters or components is modeled using ML. Hybrid models make ML complementary to the process-based ET framework, which to find an optimal junction between well physical mechanism and high model performance. The daily ET estimates were evaluated at 28 eddy covariance flux tower sites, as well as by comparison with two process-based ET algorithms (a Penman-Monteith-based ET-PM algorithm and a Priestley-Taylor-based ET-PT algorithm) and a data-oriented pure ML method. The hybrid models decreased the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of two physical algorithms (1.11 mm/day for ET-PM, 1.09 mm/day for ET-PT) to 0.50 mm/day, and increased the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) (0.35 for ET-PM, 0.36 for ET-PT) to 0.92. Our hybrid models also showed improved performance (KGE of 0.65) than pure ML (KGE of 0.62) at data-sparse regions as well as for the responses to extreme weather events. It indicates that our approach does not only boost the ET simulation accuracy, but also improve the physical un-derstanding of ML-based ET estimation. More importantly, ML-Es focuses on the ET components on the TP and is more well-defined than ML-Gs. An innovation of our approach is that for data-sparse regions and extreme cases, the more robust physical mechanism was coupled, the better generalization performance of hybrid model could achieve. The spatiotemporal ET patterns based on our hybrid models were consistent with the variations in local climatic regions and could provide critical information on the understanding of hydrological processes under the global and regional climate changes.

AB Current aerosol remote sensing without using multi-view satellite sensors still fail to retrieve its components directly, such as black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) simultaneously due to the limitations on available observations. In this study, A new general carbonaceous aerosol retrieval strategy for geostationary single-view satellite observations is implemented based on a method of critical reflectance, to retrieve the parameters of BC and extra OC concentration from measured radiance without prior quantification of Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT). The method is based on measuring the change in upward reflectance between clear and hazy days over a varying surface reflectance, with the aim of finding a balance between brightening due to scattering and darkening due to absorption. Since aerosols in the proposed algorithm are considered as a mixture of BC, OC and clustered shell aerosols, this balance can be used to retrieve concentration parameters of these components via radiative transfer models. Sensitivity tests indicate that different scenarios of BC and OC volume fractions can introduce certain sensitivity pattern on critical reflectance. The retrieval is achieved by minimizing the differ-ences between measured critical reflectance and a set of look-up tables (LUTs). Random sampling consensus (RANSAC) is also used in the strategy to reduce the influence of clouds and anomalous pixels on the retrievals. Since critical reflectance should be calculated by comparing geometrically consistent clear and hazy images, the algorithm is more suitable for geostationary satellites with constant viewing geometries. An initial validation and application applied to Himawari images over the North China Plain (NCP) shows that the carbonaceous aerosol retrievals are highly consistent with the expectations in terms of spatial and temporal patterns. The retrievals of BC and OC concentration follow the daily fluctuations of the Aethalometers observations and feature small differences in mean values throughout the month. Additionally, the AOTs at 0.55 mu m can be also satisfactorily reproduced based on the carbonaceous aerosol retrievals, resulting in a mean absolute error of 0.089 and a correlation coefficient of 0.870. The main errors in the method arise from shell model assumptions, RANSAC fitting bias, inconsistent clear reference AOT in LUT, and geometric inconsistency between the clear reference and hazy images. This work indicates that the BC and OC concentration in high resolution can be acquired through the geostationary single-view remote sensing for the further air quality and climate studies.

AB Excellent progress has been made in characterizing and understanding ice loss in Greenland, but most existing studies used a constant model to describe the long-term trend, preventing a detailed and rigorous understanding of change in the trend. Moreover, the impacts of atmospheric forcing on the trend of ice mass change are not clear. To address these limitations, we propose a piecewise trajectory model to detect the breaking points in the trend of ice mass change and estimate the optimal segmented trends. A breaking point located around 2012.6 was detected in the CW, SW, NE, SE, and the whole Greenland based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Exper-iment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-on (FO) data and the mass budget method (MBM). Piecewise trend estimates from both methods suggest that the ice loss decelerated dramatically in east Greenland in 2012.6-2021 compared to 2002-2012.6. The GRACE results indicate that the mass loss rate decelerated by 70% (22.1 +/- 0.8 to 6.6 +/- 1.0 Gt/yr) in the NE and 38% (89.0 +/- 1.5 to 55.4 +/- 0.7 Gt/yr) in the SE. Though the rates slightly increased in some regions, the Greenland ice loss rate overall decreased from 269.9 +/- 1.8 Gt/yr to 217.0 +/- 3.3 Gt/yr. Mass budget analysis suggests that this deceleration was mainly caused by increased precipitation in east Greenland, which was associated with persistent positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase in 2013-2021. During this positive NAO period, the enhanced westerlies and low-pressure anomaly off southeast Greenland advected more wet warm air to east Greenland and thus caused more precipitation. As the NAO exhibited a strong positive trend in this century, if it persists into the future, precipitation will have a high chance to increase in east Greenland, benefitting Greenland retaining ice.

AB Optical remote sensing permits modeling of variables related to forest biomass, which is a critical determinant of carbon (C) stocks and fluxes. Plant functional characteristics can be captured by (hyper)spectral data, but it remains unclear whether the links between spectral information and C content are driven largely by tree composition, tree diversity, or by forest attributes not commonly measured in field inventories (e.g., physical canopy structure). Here, we examine the relationship between hyperspectral reflectance and aboveground C content in forests, testing the relative importance of tree composition and diversity in mediating this relationship. We use hyperspectral imaging data from an airborne survey with precisely geo-located field data on canopy trees in two forests in southern Que ' bec, Canada. Spectral data covering visible (VIS), near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths were extracted for 2626 tree crowns within 64 field plots distributed along an elevational gradient. We applied a continuum removal to the spectra and subsequently performed a principal component analysis to reduce the spectral dimensionality. From the spectral principal components, for each plot we quantified (i) spectral composition (based on average reflectance per plot), and (ii) spectral diversity using the convex hull volume. From field data, we calculated variables characterizing the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic composition and diversity of canopy trees. Carbon content was calculated using allometric equa-tions based on tree size. We applied a structural equation model based on partial-least squares to test both in-direct effects of spectral composition and diversity on C storage of trees (via on-the-ground tree composition or diversity), and also direct effects (reflecting forest characteristics unmeasured in field surveys). We found that spectral composition, particularly from the VIS, is related to C content largely indirectly, via changes in tree composition along the elevational gradient (a transition from deciduous to coniferous species with increasing elevation). Though spectral diversity was significantly related to tree species diversity, no direct or indirect effects on C content were detected. Overall, our findings support (i) the importance of tree composition (but not diversity) in mediating the link between hyperspectral data and forest C content, and (ii) the use of hyperspectral remote sensing as an effective surrogate of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic composition of tree com-munities with strong links to C storage.

AB The fusion of spatiotemporal data provides the possibility to improve both the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing data. Nevertheless, the performance of current spatiotemporal data fusion methods is affected by several aspects, e.g., (1) retrieval of abrupt land cover changes, (2) recovery of detailed spatial information, and (3) the need to reduce side effects related to the performance differences between sensors. Concerning the above aspects, this study proposes the use of a Variation-based Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (VSDF) method. In VSDF, an abundant variation classification (AVC) is used to identify explicitly the land cover changes for spectral unmixing. In addition, feature-level fusion is introduced to strengthen the spatial structures, i.e., the edges and texture. Furthermore, a relative reliability index (RRI) is proposed to guide the prediction process to lower the uncertainty of the input datasets. With reference to the all-round performance assessment (APA) metrics, the performance of VSDF was compared with five popular methods, i.e., Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), FSDAF 2.0, Reliable and Adaptive Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (RASDF), and Fit-FC (regression model Fitting, spatial Filtering and residual Compensation). The experimental results demonstrated that VSDF can realize a more accurate prediction of temporal land cover changes with better spatial detail than the benchmark methods. Consequently, VSDF has the potential to generate accurate high-spatiotemporal-resolution simulations for global remote sensing studies.

AB High-quality and long-term surface soil moisture (SSM) and root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) data are critical for agricultural water management of Jiangsu province, which is a major agricultural province in China. However, few studies assessed the accuracy of SSM and RZSM datasets in croplands of Jiangsu province. The study addressed this gap by firstly using observations from ninety-one sites to assess thirteen satellite and model-based SSM products (Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) Combined/Passive/Active, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity in version IC (SMOS-IC), Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)-Multi-Temporal Dual-channel Algorithm (MTDCA)/Level 3 (L3)/Level 4 (L4)/SMAP-INRAE-BORDEAUX (IB)/ Multi-channel Collaborative Algorithm (MCCA), the fifth generation of the land component of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5-Land), and the Noah land surface model driven by Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS-Noah)), and four RZSM products (ERA5-Land, GLDAS-Noah, SMAP-L4 and ESA CCI (retrieved using ESA CCI Combined SSM coupled with an exponential filter)). We also inter-compared time-invariant and time-variant Triple Collocation Analysis (TCA)-based R with in situ-based R calculated using SSM anomalies. Various evaluation strategies were compared using different groups of available sites and temporal samplings. Our results showed that the model-based and combined SSM products (i.e., ERA5-Land, SMAP-L4, ESA CCI Combined/Passive/Active, GLDAS-Noah, ASCAT) performed better than the other SSM products and ERA5-Land, SMAP-L4 and ESA CCI RZSM generally performed better than the GLDAS-Noah RZSM product with higher R. Similar performance rankings were observed among time-invariant and time-variant TCA-R and in situ-based R, in which the TCA-R values for all SSM datasets were higher than the in situ-based R as the representativeness errors of the in situ measurements may bias in situ-based R. The accuracy of the ESA CCI, GLDAS-Noah and ERA5-Land SSM products was expected to be enhanced by considering the water effect and high uncertainties were observed for MTDCA and SMAP-MCCA SSM over dense vegetation periods and regions. Also, it is important to select appropriate evaluation strategies to conduct the SSM and RZSM evaluations according to the situation as the available sites and temporal samplings may bias the evalu-ation results.

AB Soils are under threat globally, with declining soil productivity and soil health in many places. As a key indicator of soil functioning, soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial for ensuring food, soil, water and energy security, together with biodiversity protection. While there is a global effort to map SOC stock and status, SOC is a dynamic soil property and can change rapidly as a function of land management and land use. Here, we introduce a semi-mechanistic model to monitor SOC stocks at a global scale, underpinned by one of the largest worldwide soil database to date. Our model generates a SOC stock baseline for the year 2001, which is then propagated through time by keeping track of annual landcover changes obtained from remote sensing products with loss and gain dynamics dependent on temperature and precipitation, which finally define the magnitude, rate and direction of the SOC changes. We estimated a global SOC stock in the top 30 cm of around 793 Pg with annual losses due to landcover change of 1.9 Pg SOC yr-1 from 2001 to 2020, 20% larger than the annual production-based emissions of the United States in 2018. The biggest losses were found in the tropic and sub-tropical regions, accounting for almost 50% of the total global loss. This is a considerable contribution to greenhouse gas emissions but it also has a direct impact on agricultural production with more than 16 million hectares yr-1 falling below critical SOC limits. The proposed modelling framework is flexible, allowing it to be updated as more remote sensing and soil data becomes available, offering a first-of-its-kind global spatio-temporal SOC stock assessment and monitoring system.

AB Multispectral remote sensing of hydrothermal alteration in volcanogenic massive sulfide (VMS) ore systems in mafic crust is relatively uncommon, in part due to the short-wave infrared spectral similarity of several key alteration minerals: epidote, chlorite, actinolite, and serpentine. In this study, we developed regional mosaic generation and classification workflows for Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) imagery to discriminate these minerals over the entire crust of the Semail ophiolite (Oman-UAE). Spectral discrimination was achieved through adaptation of the ASTER (pre-)processing workflow to the specific mapping targets, available datasets, and location of this study. Necessary steps included the pre-selection of ASTER scenes without residual atmospheric water features, mosaic normalization based solely on overlapping target outcrops, correcting cross-mosaic ramp errors, and alteration map classification based on image-derived reference data. The resulting alteration map, validated through comparison with field mapping and sampling, is the most areally extensive continuous survey of hydrothermal alteration yet presented for oceanic crust, providing a renewed framework for research and mineral exploration of Earth's largest ophiolite. Our map confirms that the vast majority of the upper oceanic crust is regionally altered to a spilite type secondary mineral assemblage. Localized areas of epidosite alteration, marking focused hydrothermal flow paths, are confined to the upper oceanic crust, whereas areas of previously unrecognized but intense actinolite alteration are common in both the lower and upper oceanic crust. Our methodological developments expand the standard considerations necessary for regional geological mapping using infrared image mosaics. They further demonstrate the under -appreciated capability of multispectral data for mapping spectrally similar rock types. Although the specifics of the method are necessarily optimized for the Oman-UAE ophiolite, re-optimization based on local reference data should allow similar results to be achieved in other well-exposed mafic-hosted VMS districts.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a primary process for water and heat transfer between the land and atmosphere. The spatial contextual information-based surface temperature versus vegetation index triangle (temperature-based triangle) is one of the most famous and widely applied methods for regional ET estimation from remotely sensed data. However, the determination of temporally variable satellite scene-specific dry and wet edges in this traditional triangle is often largely biased due to the limited range of variability of surface soil moisture avail-ability and fractional vegetation cover (or the nonexistence of end-member pixels), or must rely on the auxiliary ground-based measurements, leading to a large uncertainty or difficulty in regional evaporative fraction esti-mation. This short communication presents a practically operational moisture-based triangle to address the deficiency of the temperature-based triangle, where temporally universal dry and wet edges in this new triangle are determined by making use of the time-series slope of remotely sensed surface temperature versus vegetation index negative relationship over a small window centering the target pixel. Our validation results show that this new triangle outperformed the temperature-based triangle, reducing the root mean square error from 0.19 to 0.16 and increasing the coefficient of determination from 0.44 to 0.53, when the model-estimated evaporative fractions were validated against ground-based eddy covariance measurements at 34 sites across the globe.

TI Towards a global seasonal and permanent reference water product from

AB Satellite-based flood mapping has become an important part of disaster response. In order to accurately distinguish flood inundation from normally present conditions, up-to-date, high-resolution information on the seasonal water cover is crucial. This information is usually neglected in disaster management, which may result in a non-reliable representation of the flood extent, mainly in regions with highly dynamic hydrological conditions. In this study, we present a fully automated method to generate a global reference water product specifically designed for the use in global flood mapping applications based on high resolution Earth Observation data. The proposed methodology combines existing processing pipelines for flood detection based on Sentinel-1/ 2 data and aggregates permanent as well as seasonal water masks over an adjustable reference time period. The water masks are primarily based on the analysis of Sentinel-2 data and are complemented by Sentinel-1-based information in optical data scarce regions. First results are demonstrated in five selected study areas (Australia, Germany, India, Mozambique, and Sudan), distributed across different climate zones and are systematically compared with external products. Further, the proposed product is exemplary applied to three real flood events in order to evaluate the impact of the used reference water mask on the derived flood extent. Results show, that it is possible to generate a consistent reference water product at 10-20 m spatial resolution, that is more suitable for the use in rapid disaster response than previous masks. The proposed multi-sensor approach is capable of producing reasonable results, even if only few or no information from optical data is available. Further it becomes clear, that the consideration of seasonality of water bodies, especially in regions with highly dynamic hydrological and climatic conditions, reduces potential over-estimation of the inundation extent and gives a more reliable picture on flood affected areas.

TI Detecting crop phenology from vegetation index time-series data by
   improved shape model fitting in each phenological stage

AB Crop phenology provides important information for crop growth management and yield estimations. The popular shape model fitting (SMF) method detects crop phenology from vegetation index (VI) time-series data, but it has two limitations. First, SMF assumes the same "relative position" of phenological stages for the pixels of the same crop type. This assumption is valid only if all target pixels, relative to the shape model, display a synchronized increase (or decrease) in length between any two phenological stages, which is uncommon in practice. Second, the variance in the resulting phenology estimates for a particular phenological stage is related to the stage itself; this makes it challenging to simulate spatial and temporal variations in crop phenology using SMF. Here, we address both limitations by developing the shape model fitting by the Separate phenological stage method ("SMF-S"). SMF-S uses a modified fitting function and an iterative procedure to match the shape model with the VI time series for each phenological stage in an adaptive local window. Comparisons between SMF-S and SMF in simulation experiments show the superior performance of SMF-S in different scenarios, regardless of noise. Comparisons involving winter wheat field observations from the North China Plain showed that the RMSE values averaged over nine phenological stages were smaller for SMF-S (RMSE = 9.5 d) than for SMF (RMSE = 13.4 d) and one variant of SMF (the shape model with accumulated growing degree days (SM-AGDD); RMSE=33.6 d). Moreover, SMF-S better described the spatial variations (i.e., variance) in the results and captured the temporal shifts in multiple phenological stages. In the derived regional phenology maps of winter wheat on the North China Plain, SMF-S generated more reasonable spatial patterns, whereas SMF underestimated (overestimated) the variance in the early (late) phenological stages. We expect that the improved crop phenology estimates obtained with SMF-S could benefit various agricultural activities.

AB Multi-angle surface reflectance data from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) were used to map aboveground biomass density (AGB, Mg ha(-1)) in the forests of the southwestern United States inter-annually from 2000 to 2015. The approach uses a multi-angle index that has a loge relationship with AGB estimates in the National Biomass and Carbon Dataset 2000 (NBCD 2000). MISR Level 1B2 Terrain radiance data from May 15-June 15 of each year were converted to mapped surface bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) and leveraged to adjust the kernel weights of the RossThin-LiSparse-Reciprocal Bidi-rectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model. The kernel weights with the lowest model-fitting RMSE were selected as the least likely to be cloud-contaminated and were used to generate synthetic MISR datasets. An optimal index calculated using BRFs modeled in the solar principal plane was found with respect to NBCD 2000 estimates for 19 sites near Mt. Lindsey, Colorado. These relationships were found in areas with AGB ranging from 20 to 190 Mg ha(-1), with the model yielding R-2 = 0.91 (RMSE: 15.4 Mg ha(-1)). With spectral-nadir metrics, the R-2 values obtained were 0.07, 0.32, and 0.37 for NIR band BRFs, NDVI, and red band BRFs, respectively. For regional application, a simplified single coefficient model was fitted to the NBCD 2000 data, to account for variations in forest type, soils, and topography. The resulting AGB maps were consistent with esti-mates from up-scaled 2005 ICESat GLAS data and 2013 NASA Carbon Monitoring System airborne lidar-derived estimates for the Rim Fire area in California; and with the 2005 GLAS-based map across the southwestern United States. Trajectories were stable through time and losses from fire and beetle disturbance matched historical data in published sources. MISR estimates were found to reliably capture ABG compared to radar-and lidar-derived estimates across the southwestern United States (N = 11,019,944), with an RMSE of 37.0 Mg ha(-1) and R-2 = 0.9 vs GLAS estimates.

AB Efficient, socially acceptable and rapid methods of exploration are required to discover new deposits and enable the green energy transition. Sustainable exploration requires a combination of innovative thinking and new technologies. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a rapidly developing technology and allows for fast and systematic mineral mapping, facilitating exploration of the Earth's surface at various scales on a variety of platforms. Newly available sensors allow data capture over a wide spectral range, and provide information about the abundance and spatial location of ore and pathfinder minerals in drill-core, hand samples and outcrops with mm to cm precision. Conversely, the complex geometries of the imaged surfaces affect the spectral quality and signal-tonoise ratio (SnR) of HSI data at these very narrow spatial samplings. Additionally, the complex mineral assemblages found in hydrothermally altered ore deposits can make interpretation of spectral results a challenge. In this contribution, we propose an innovative approach that integrates multiple sensors and scales of data acquisition to help disentangle complex mineralogy associated with lithium and tin mineralisation in the Uis pegmatite complex, Namibia. We train this method using hand samples and finally produce a three-dimensional (3D) point cloud for mapping lithium mineralisation in the open pit. We were able to identify and map lithium bearing cookeite and montebrasite at outcrop scale. The accuracy of the approach was validated by drill-core data, XRD analysis and LIBS measurements. This approach facilitates efficient mapping of complex terrains, as well as important monitoring and optimisation of ore extraction. Our method can easily be adapted to other minerals relevant to the mining industry.

AB We quantify and characterize methane emissions from a natural gas well blowout in Louisiana, USA in 2019 using TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) methane observations and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) gas flare detections. We use TROPOMI data in a Bayesian inversion to optimize daily methane emissions while VIIRS-based radiant heat data are used to estimate the amount of gas flared. This hybrid approach allows for the characterization of methane emissions during both the flaring and venting phases of the blowout, where more than half of the blowout duration was associated with flaring. We estimate overall emissions of this 38-day event at 49 (21-63) Gg, which is lower than reported by the gas company but exceeds all known US point sources emitting at the time in terms of emission rate. We estimate that over 80% of total emissions come from the venting phase, leaving the flaring phase responsible for only a small fraction of total emissions. We show that routine satellite operations from global-scale observing instruments such as TROPOMI and VIIRS when combined can provide a detailed assessment of quantitative greenhouse gas emissions from large point sources including stochastic events and thus these data could be used for regulatory enforcement.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is listed as an essential climate variable (ECV) and supports quantitative estimates of the energy budget while serving as a proxy for measuring the effects of climate change and extreme events. Forested areas are considered a major land unit impacted by temperature rise; therefore, thorough monitoring is mandatory. An accuracy assessment of the LST of forests must consider their directional anisotropy (DA). This latter can be well depicted by thermal infrared (TIR) radiative transfer models, but the problem is complex for forests because many of the shaded areas generate multiscale gradients of temperature. In this paper, we adapted a mature and widely used visible and near-infrared (VNIR) radiative transfer model called forest reflectance and transmittance (FRT) to enhance the characterization of the DA of forest temperature. In the FRT model, the vertical heterogeneity of the forest is quantified by using the discrete elements of multilayer scene components (i.e., the tree crown, trunk, understory vegetation, and soil), thus inferring vertical thermal gradients. The Planck function and spectral-invariant theory are considered to assess the thermal emissions of the scene components and their multiple scattering processes. The FRT model is validated using directional forest brightness temperatures (BT) measured from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and simulated by using the three-dimensional ray-tracing LESS (large-scale remote sensing data and image simulation framework over heterogeneous 3D scenes) model. The results show that FRT behaves reliably since the root mean square error (RMSE) is lower than 1.0 degrees C for UAV measurements obtained at 09:20 and 13:10 and with coefficients of determination (R2) larger than 0.74 and 0.56, respectively; these results are better than the simulated results by existing models. Moreover, the comparison with ray-tracing simulations was also deemed satisfactory. According to the analysis, large variations in BT DAs may appear for different forests and seasonal changes staged by structural and thermal stratification, thus indicating the necessity of using the FRT model for complex and dynamic forest canopies.

AB The multi-channel satellite passive-microwave record of Earth's sea ice coverage, extending back to the late 1970s, has long revealed declining sea ice coverage in the Arctic but through 2015 revealed an overall increase rather than decrease in Antarctic sea ice coverage. Following major decreases in Antarctic sea ice since 2015, the 42-year 1979-2020 satellite dataset now shows recent losses in sea ice coverage in both hemispheres, and this is convincingly demonstrated by the enumeration of monthly and yearly record high and record low sea ice extents experienced over the course of the 42 years. In fact, one of the most convincing statistics on the declining Arctic sea ice cover is the fact that since 1986 the Arctic has not experienced a single monthly record high sea ice extent in any month but has experienced 93 monthly record lows. In contrast, all 12 calendar months have their 42-year Antarctic monthly record high sea ice extents in the period 2007-2015, while 8 of the 12 calendar months have had Antarctic record lows since 2015. Globally, every calendar month has registered a new monthly record low within the past 5 years. These results are complemented (and somewhat tempered) by quantification of the range of monthly and yearly sea ice extent values over the 42 years. For instance, although the Arctic's lowest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 2012) is 53% lower than its highest September monthly average sea ice extent (in 1980), the other months have far smaller percent differences between their lowest and highest Arctic values. For yearly average sea ice extents, the Arctic's lowest value (in 2020) is 18% lower than its highest value (in 1982), the Antarctic's lowest value (in 2017) is 16% lower than its highest value (in 2014), and the global lowest value (in 2019) is only 12% lower than its highest value (in 1982).

AB The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) is unique in its ability to perform profiling measurements of aerosol and cloud layers globally. Detecting the layer boundaries of aerosols and clouds is a crucial step in CALIPSO data retrieval. The CALIPSO team uses the selective iterated boundary location (SIBYL) algorithm based on threshold arrays to find aerosol and cloud layers at different horizontal resolutions. However, threshold arrays could obstruct the detection of optically tenuous layers at a high resolution and may cause overestimation when averaging signals of layer and clear air at a low resolution. Here, a multiscale algorithm using a series of sliding window sizes without threshold setting is proposed based on a pre-defined probability. The results over land and marine areas show that the multiscale algorithm detected 37.41% and 16.36% more layer area than the SIBYL at 1-80 km resolutions at daytime and 1-5 km resolutions at night time, respectively. This indicates that the multiscale algorithm does not need a threshold array, allowing more tenuous layers to be detected, especially at low signal to noise ratios (SNRs). In contrast, the SIBYL detects 4.40% more layer area than the multiscale algorithm at 1-80 km resolutions at nighttime, mainly caused by the large proportion of layer area detected by SIBYL at 20 and 80 km resolutions. This implies possible noteworthy overestimation by the SIBYL at low resolutions. Additionally, the evaluation using the depolarization ratio of ice clouds shows that the extra detected layers by the multiscale algorithm are reliable. Besides, simulation tests show that the multiscale and SIBYL algorithms achieve a 100% true detection rate when SNR is approximately 2 and 4, respectively. The new multiscale algorithm could upgrade the resolution and accuracy of the layer detection of space lidars and reduce the underestimation of layer optical depth due to missing layers.

TI Building damage assessment for rapid disaster response with a deep

AB Sudden-onset natural and man-made disasters represent a threat to the safety of human life and property. Rapid and accurate building damage assessment using bitemporal high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images can quickly and safely provide us with spatial distribution information and statistics of the damage degree to assist with humanitarian assistance and disaster response. For building damage assessment, strong feature representation and semantic consistency are the keys to obtaining a high accuracy. However, the conventional object-based image analysis (OBIA) framework using a patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) can guarantee semantic consistency, but with weak feature representation, while the Siamese fully convolutional network approach has strong feature representation capabilities but is semantically inconsistent. In this paper, we propose a deep object-based semantic change detection framework, called ChangeOS, for building damage assessment. To seamlessly integrate OBIA and deep learning, we adopt a deep object localization network to generate accurate building objects, in place of the superpixel segmentation commonly used in the conventional OBIA framework. Furthermore, the deep object localization network and deep damage classification network are integrated into a unified semantic change detection network for end-to-end building damage assessment. This also provides deep object features that can supply an object prior to the deep damage classification network for more consistent semantic feature representation. Object-based post-processing is adopted to further guarantee the semantic consistency of each object. The experimental results obtained on a global scale dataset including 19 natural disaster events and two local scale datasets including the Beirut port explosion event and the Bata military barracks explosion event show that ChangeOS is superior to the currently published methods in speed and accuracy, and has a superior generalization ability for man-made disasters.

AB In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning method widely applied in remote sensing-based studies in recent years, for burned area (BA) mapping combining radar and optical datasets acquired by Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 on-board sensors, respectively. Combining active and passive datasets into a seamless wall-to-wall cloud cover independent mapping algorithm significantly improves existing methods based on either sensor type. Five areas were used to determine the optimum model settings and sensors integration, whereas five additional ones were utilised to validate the results. The optimum CNN dimension and data normalisation were conditioned by the observed land cover class and data type (i.e., optical or radar). Increasing network complexity (i.e., number of hidden layers) only resulted in rising computing time without any accuracy enhancement when mapping BA. The use of an optimally defined CNN within a joint active/passive data combination allowed for (i) BA mapping with similar or slightly higher accuracy to those achieved in previous approaches based on Sentinel-1 (Dice coefficient, DC of 0.57) or Sentinel-2 (DC 0.7) only and (ii) wall-to-wall mapping by eliminating information gaps due to cloud cover, typically observed for opticalbased algorithms.

AB Thematic maps are often derived from remotely sensed imagery via a supervised image classification analysis. The training and testing stages of a supervised image classification may proceed ignorant of the presence of some classes in the region to be mapped. This violates the assumption of an exhaustively defined set of classes that is often made in classification analyses. In such circumstances, the overall accuracy of a thematic map produced by the application of a trained classifier will be less than the accuracy of the classification of the test set by the same classifier. This situation arises because the cases of an untrained class can normally only be commissioned into the set of trained classes. Simple mathematical relationships between classification and map accuracy are shown for assessments of overall, user?s and producer?s accuracy. For example, it is shown that in a simple scenario the accuracy of a thematic map is less than that of a classification, scaling as a function of the abundance of the untrained class(es). Impacts on other estimates made from thematic maps, such as class areal extent, are also briefly discussed. When using a thematic map, care is needed in interpreting and using classification accuracy assessments as sometimes they may not reflect properties of the map well.

AB Despite an ever-increasing number of spaceborne, airborne, and ground-based data acquisition platforms, remote sensing data are still often spatially incomplete or temporally irregular. While deterministic interpolation techniques are often used, they tend to create unrealistic spatial patterns and generally do not provide uncertainty quantification. Geostatistical simulation models are effective in generating an ensemble of realistic and equally probable realizations of an unmeasured phenomenon, allowing data uncertainty to be propagated. These models are commonly used in several fields of earth science, and in recent years, they have been applied widely to remotely sensed data. This study provides the first review of the applications of geostatistical simulation to remote sensing data. We review recent geostatistical simulation models relevant to satellite remote sensing data and discuss the characteristics and advantages of each approach. Finally, the applications of each geostatistical simulation model are categorized in different domains of natural sciences, including soil, vegetation, topography, and atmospheric science.

Timely information regarding extent, timing and magnitude of forest disturbance events is crucial for effective disturbance management strategies. Yet, we still lack accurate, near-real-time and high-performance remote sensing tools for monitoring abrupt and subtle forest disturbances. This study presents a new approach called 'Stochastic Continuous Change Detection (S-CCD)' using a dense Landsat data time series. S-CCD improves upon the 'COntinuous monitoring of Land Disturbance (COLD)' approach by incorporating a mathematical tool called the 'state space model', which treats trends and seasonality as stochastic processes, allowing for modeling temporal dynamics of satellite observations in a recursive way. The quantitative accuracy assessment is evaluated based on 3782 Landsat-based disturbance reference plots (30 m) from a probability sampling distributed throughout the Conterminous United States. Validation results show that the overall accuracy (best F1 score) of S-CCD is 0.793 with 20% omission error and 21% commission error, slightly higher than that of COLD (0.789). Two disturbance sites respectively associated with wildfire and insect disturbances are used for qualitative map-based analysis. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that S-CCD achieves fewer omission errors than COLD for detecting those disturbances with subtle/gradual spectral change. In addition, S-CCD facilitates a better real-time monitoring, benefited by its complete recursive manner and a shorter lag for confirming disturbance than COLD (126 days vs. 166 days for alerting 50% disturbance events), and reached up to similar to 4.4 times speedup for computation. This research addresses the need for near-real-time monitoring and large-scale mapping of forest health and offers a new approach for operationally performing change detection tasks from dense Landsat-based time series.

AB Plant functional diversity, defined as the range of plant chemical, physiological and structural properties within plants, is a key component of biodiversity which controls the ecosystem functioning and stability. Monitoring its variations across space and over time is critical in ecological studies. So far, several reflectance-based metrics have been tested to achieve this objective, yielding different degrees of success. Our work aimed at exploring the potential of a novel metric based on far-red sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F-760) to map the functional diversity of terrestrial ecosystems. This was achieved exploiting high-resolution images collected over a mixed forest ecosystem with the HyPlant sensor, deployed as an airborne demonstrator of the forthcoming ESA-FLEX satellite. A reference functional diversity map was obtained applying the Rao's Q entropy metric on principal components calculated on key plant functional trait maps retrieved from the hyperspectral reflectance cube. Based on the spectral variation hypothesis, which states that the biodiversity signal is encoded in the spectral heterogeneity, two moving window-based approaches were tested to estimate the functional diversity from continuous spectral data: i) the Rao's Q entropy metric calculated on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ii) the coefficient of variation (CV) calculated on hyperspectral reflectance. Finally, a third moving window approach was used to estimate the functional diversity based on F-760 heterogeneity quantified through the calculation of the Rao's Q entropy metric.
   Results showed a strong underestimation of the functional diversity using the Rao's Q index based on NDVI and the CV of reflectance. In both cases, a weak correlation was found against the reference functional diversity map (r(2) = 0.05, p < .001 and r(2) = 0.04, p < .001, respectively). Conversely, the Rao's Q index calculated on F-760 revealed similar patterns as the ones observed in the reference map and a better correlation (r(2) = 0.5, p < .001). This corroborates the potential of far-red F for assessing the functional diversity of terrestrial ecosystems, opening unprecedented perspectives for biodiversity monitoring across different spatial and temporal scales.

AB Climate change is a threat to many high-latitude regions. Changing patterns in precipitation intensity and increasing glacial ablation during spring and summer have major influence on river dynamics and the risk of widespread flooding. To monitor these rapid events, more frequent discharge observations are necessary. Having access to near-daily satellite based discharge observations is therefore highly beneficial. In this context, the recently launched Sentinel-1 and 2 satellites promise unprecedented potential, due to their capacity to obtain radar and optical data at high spatial (10 m) and high temporal (1-3 days) resolutions. Here, we use both missions to provide a novel approach to estimate the discharge of the Pjorsa (Thjorsa) river, Iceland, on a near-daily basis. Iceland, and many other high-latitude regions, are affected by frequent cloud-cover, limiting the availability of cloud-free optical Sentinel-2 data. We trained a Random Forest supervised machine learning classifier with a set of Sentinel-1 backscatter metrics to classify water in the individual Sentinel-1 images. A Sentinel-2 based classification mask was created to improve the classification results. Second, we derived the river surface area and converted it to the effective width, which we used to estimate the discharge using an at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) rating curve. We trained the rating curve for a six-month training period using in situ discharge observations and assessed the effect of training area selection. We used the trained rating curve to estimate discharge for a one-year monitoring period between 2017/10 and 2018/10. Results showed a Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) of 0.831, indicating the usefulness of dense Sentinel-1 and 2 observations for accurate discharge estimations of a medium-sized (200 m width) high-latitude river on a near-daily basis (1.56 days on average). We demonstrated that satellite based discharge products can be a valuable addition to in situ discharge observations, also during ice-jam events.

AB The lack of aerosol information over the cryosphere introduces large uncertainties to our understanding of phenomenon, known as the Arctic Amplification (AA) and its feedback mechanisms. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) describes the optical characteristics of aerosol loading. This paper describes a novel algorithm, which retrieves AOD above snow-covered regions from the measurements of the up-welling radiation at the top of atmosphere, observed by the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instruments. The algorithm optimizes the generic eXtensible Bremen Aerosol/cloud and surfacE parameters Retrieval (XBAER) approach for longer wavelengths over the cryosphere. The algorithm utilizes the characteristics of solar bidirectional distribution properties of snow and aerosol at wavelength 3.7 mu m to derive above-snow-AOD. Since the impact of fine-mode aerosol on 3.7 mu m is ignorable, the retrieved AOD in this manuscript represents mainly coarse-mode dominated part. A novel method to extract the solar reflection part at 3.7 mu m is presented and used in the surface parameterization. Two aerosol types (sea salt-dominated and dust-dominated) are used and the best-fit type is derived by an iterative procedure, using a LookUp-Table (LUT) approach. Sensitivity studies of the impact on the retrieved AOD using XBAER algorithm, which investigate the impacts of aerosol type, snow surface emissivity and potential cloud contamination under typical AATSR observation conditions, are presented. The sensitivity studies show that the surface parametrization and aerosol typing are suitable for the retrieval of above-snow-AOD over the Arctic snow-covered region. AOD observations retrieved in this study from AATSR (2002-2012) observation collocated with those from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites over Greenland show good agreement. 72.1% of the match-ups fall into the expected error envelope of (+/- 0.15AOD +/- 0.025). The AATSR derived above-snow-AOD at 0.55 mu m research product has also been compared with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) aerosol product, the Mineral Aerosols Profiling from Infrared Radiances (MAPIR) derived Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) AOD research product, and the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) AOD simulations over Greenland on April 2011. The comparison reveals that all datasets show similar patterns for the AOD above Greenland. The AOD is smaller in central Greenland and larger over the coastline regions. The XBAER derived above-snow-AOD has improved coverage, as compared to that of the existing AATSR aerosol product. The transition between above-snow-AOD and AOD derived over surrounding ocean surfaces does not indicate any systematic errors. Two aerosol transport events have been well-captured by the XBAER derived above-snow-AOD research product. The new algorithm is also applied to the SLSTR onboard Sentinel-3 demonstrating new SLSTR above-snow-AOD data products, and its value for research in the changing AOD during the period of Arctic Amplification.

AB The U.S. Geological Survey Land Change Monitoring, Assessment and Projection (USGS LCMAP) initiative is working toward a comprehensive capability to characterize land cover and land cover change using dense Landsat time series data. A suite of products including annual land cover maps and annual land cover change maps will be produced using the Landsat 4-8 data record. LCMAP products will initially be created for the conterminous United States (CONUS) and then extended to include Alaska and Hawaii. A critical component of LCMAP is the collection of reference data using the TimeSync tool, a web-based interface for manually interpreting and recording land cover from Landsat data supplemented with fine resolution imagery and other ancillary data. These reference data will be used for area estimation and validation of the LCMAP annual land cover products. Nearly 12,000 LCMAP reference sample pixels have been interpreted and a simple random subsample of these pixels has been interpreted independently by a second analyst (hereafter referred to as "duplicate interpretations"). The annual land cover reference class labels for the 1984-2016 monitoring period obtained from these duplicate interpretations are used to address the following questions: 1) How consistent are the reference class labels among interpreters overall and per class? 2) Does consistency vary by geographic region? 3) Does consistency vary as interpreters gain experience over time? 4) Does interpreter consistency change with improving availability and quality of imagery from 1984 to 2016? Overall agreement between interpreters was 88%. Class-specific agreement ranged from 46% for Disturbed to 94% for Water, with more prevalent classes (Tree Cover, Grass/Shrub and Cropland) generally having greater agreement than rare classes (Developed, Barren and Wetland). Agreement between interpreters remained approximately the same over the 12-month period during which these interpretations were completed. Increasing availability of Landsat and Google Earth fine resolution data over the 1984 to 2016 monitoring period coincided with increased interpreter consistency for the post-2000 data record. The reference data interpretation and quality assurance protocols implemented for LCMAP demonstrate the technical and practical feasibility of using the Landsat archive and intensive human interpretation to produce national, annual reference land cover data over a 30-year period. Protocols to estimate and enhance interpreter consistency are critical elements to document and ensure the quality of these reference data.

AB For retrospective land cover change analysis extending back in time earlier than approximately the year 2000, multispectral remote sensing data such as the Landsat archive are often the only available and systematically archived data source. However, the spatial resolution of such observations often impedes the change analysis of geographic phenomena that may occur at sub-pixel level, such as changes in built-up land. In such cases, the integration of these data products with increasingly available contemporary high resolution settlement data employed as spatial constraints can potentially mitigate this drawback. Little research has been done regarding the quantitative potential of such integrative approaches, often due to the lack of multi-temporal reference data about changes in built-up area at sufficient spatio-temporal granularity and extent. In this contribution, we present and evaluate a time-series based approach for built-up area change analysis using Landsat time series data, spatially constrained by contemporary building footprint data. We evaluate the potential of our approach using a highly accurate multi-temporal reference database of built-up areas created through integrating publicly available building footprint and cadastral data in selected regions of the United States of America.

AB Sea Surface Temperature (SST) is an essential variable for understanding key physical and biological processes. Blended and interpolated L4 SST products offer major advantages over alternative SST data sources due to their spatial and temporal completeness, yet their ability to discriminate upwelling-induced steep temperature transitions in coastal waters remains largely unassessed. Here we analysed the performance of eleven L4 GHRSST-compliant products in estimating in situ water temperatures recorded by a large network of shallow subtidal and intertidal temperature loggers deployed in shores covering regimes with a wide range of upwelling intensities. Results indicate that while most products perform satisfactorily for most of the year, performance is severely affected during the upwelling season in locations with strong upwelling. We show that upwelling negatively impacts all four metrics used to assess dataset performance (average bias, correlation, centred root-mean-square error and normalized standard deviation), leading to a considerable overestimation of coastal water temperatures (with average bias exceeding 2 degrees C in some cases). We also show that while the use of L3 data (i. e., prior to blending and interpolation) leads to an increase in performance compared to L4 GHRSST-compliant products, the gain is probably not substantial enough to offset issues related with their spatial and temporal inconsistency along coastlines. Our results suggest that the use of L4 GHRSST-compliant products can lead to a misrepresentation of the thermal fingerprint of upwelling, and thus should be limited (or even avoided) in locations dominated by its effects. Conversely, the use of L4 GHRSST-compliant products on locations with little to no upwelling appears to be warranted. The mismatch between in situ and remotely-sensed sea water temperatures here reported also highlights the need for implementation of long-term monitoring networks of in situ temperature loggers.

AB Remote sensing of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) provides great potential for estimating gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems. A strong relationship between SIF and GPP has been observed at the seasonal scale from both ground-based and satellite observations. However, variations of SIF due to changes in plant growth stages appear to influence the SIF-GPP relationship. It remains unclear how this relationship is affected by plant growth-related changes, especially for C4 plants such as maize. In this study, continuous in situ measurements for canopy far-red SIF retrieval and GPP calculation were made in maize during the growing season of 2017. Diurnal and seasonal variations of canopy SIF and its yield (SIFyield) were analyzed over different growth stages of maize to understand how they affect the relationship with GPP. The results show that the relationship between SIP and GPP varies with the growth stages of maize during the growing season, indicating that canopy structure has a strong impact on the seasonal variations of canopy SIF and its relation to GPP. Furthermore, we found that SIFyield is significantly correlated with canopy photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) at the canopy level throughout the season. However, it is almost uncorrelated with LUE after adjusting for the effects of canopy structure with the structural vegetation index MTVI2. This finding highlights the importance of canopy structure in the relationship between SIFyield and LUE, complicating the use of canopy SIF for tracking vegetation physiological activity. Overall, our observation-based findings show that canopy structure affects the SIF-GPP relationship, strengthening our understanding of the mechanistic link between SIF and photosynthesis.

AB Increasing evidence suggests that ecosystem functions are strongly linked to morphological plant traits, like specific leaf area (SLA) and its variability, which serve as a proxy of functional diversity (FD). Functional diversity is rarely studied at regional scales, and its scale dependence is poorly understood. Capturing trait variations at distinct spatial scales and in differently managed grasslands remains challenging, mainly because a limited number of trait measurements are available and field campaigns are time-consuming. Here, we derived alpha- and beta-FD indices based on SLA measured in the field and estimated from optical satellite data by using molecular absorption profiles of leaves in canopies. We inverted the 1-D columnar radiative transfer model PROSAIL using Sentinel-2 reflectance data at canopy level. From the inversion we were able to distinguish different alpine management types based on retrieved SLA. Model uncertainties were mainly related to the different local plant communities, here represented by functional diversity indices and community-weighted means of traits. Thus, successful PROSAIL application was affected by management type. Management categories displaying lower alpha-FD, like mowed and fertilized, delivered the most reliable results. Further, we compared FD (i.e., richness, evenness, divergence) from local to regional scales. Locally, management determines the magnitude of FD, whereas on a regional scale, parcel size and the uniformity of agricultural practices control trait diversity. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying beta-FD from space as it delivers additional information on the impact of management types, differing from locally measured alpha-FD values.

AB Most large temperate lakes experience overturning every spring and fall as surface water moves past 4 degrees C, the temperature of maximum density for freshwater. These semiannual, lake-wide overturning events play an important role regulating the thermal structure, deep-water ventilation, nutrient supply, water circulation, and nearshore water quality of the lakes. The general pattern of overturning has long been known from field observations and models, but its timing, duration, detailed spatio-temporal progression and seasonal and inter-annual variability remain largely undocumented, particularly in the context of recent climate-driven changes in lake thermal dynamics. Here, we used a reconstructed record of daily and spatially-explicit lake surface water temperatures (LSWT) to analyze the migration of the 4 degrees C thermal front as it progressed from the shorelines to the deep parts of the Laurentian Great Lakes during every overturning event between June 1995 to April 2012. The analysis revealed a strong asymmetry in the timing and duration of overturning between spring and fall, and no relationship with the lake-averaged LSWT or its rate of change. Key differences in the average spatio-temporal progression of overturning were also observed between spring and fall, with the spring progression being largely driven by latitude and water depth and the fall progression being less predictable and influenced by other factors such as wind. Narrow regions of very slow overturning progression were also identified, revealing areas of the lakes where persistent 4 degrees C thermal bars are likely to re-occur every year. The timing and duration of these seasonal overturning events varied between years by as much as one and two months, respectively, with a direct impact on the duration of lake-wide stratification. In 2012, Lakes Michigan and Ontario experienced an incomplete fall overturning, leading only to a partial winter stratification. Lakes Michigan and Ontario were more susceptible to experience an incomplete overturning than the other Laurentian Great Lakes, seemingly due to a combination of comparatively milder winter air temperatures and lower lake dynamic ratio (steepness of bottom slope). Overall, the duration of lake-wide winter stratification was found to be strongly correlated with mean winter air temperatures, and a simple trend analysis suggested that rising temperatures could lead to more frequent incomplete fall overturnings and partial winter stratifications in Lakes Michigan and Ontario over the next few decades. This study demonstrated that remote sensing provides an unparalleled tool for assessing the long-term variability in the overturning behavior of large lakes in the context of climate change.

AB The radiative transfer scheme implemented for the retrieval of soil moisture from passive microwaves is a function of scattering, polarization mixing and attenuation effects of soil and vegetation. Theses factors are usually represented by Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD), vegetation scattering albedo, and surface roughness parameter, along with soil moisture. The VOD is the degree to which vegetation attenuates the microwave radiation. It has generally the dominant effect from vegetation, whereas scattering is negligible and close to zero. The surface roughness (which varies in space but not much in time) is until recently, often assumed to be a global constant. In this work, we attempted to simultaneously retrieve the VOD, the surface roughness parameter, and the soil moisture at the global scale using the Level 3 daily 0.25 degrees X-band brightness temperatures of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor. The methodology, coined as the Simultaneous Parameter Retrieval Algorithm (SPRA), is based on the premise that the vegetation dynamics undergo slower temporal changes than the soil moisture-an assumption, which is successfully used in the past for microwave radiometric retrievals at lower frequencies. Results indicate that the SPRA produces the VOD retrievals with reduced high-frequency noise when compared to the baseline Land Parameter Retrieval Algorithm (LPRM) retrievals. This effect assisted in identifying the influence of precipitation and cropping patterns on the temporal dynamics of the VOD. Good agreement is observed between the mean SPRA VOD and canopy height data (global correlation = 0.75). The spatial patterns of surface roughness parameter agree well with the roughness product (HR map) developed using Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) sensor based data (global correlation = 0.57). Validation of SPRA and LPRM soil moisture products with in-situ observations over the Contiguous United States (CONUS) indicated an improvement in mean ubRMSE with SPRA product (SPRA-0.11 m(3)/m(3) and LPRM-0.18 m(3)/m(3)) and comparable mean Pearson correlations between the two products (SPRA-0.36 and LPRM-0.38). Further, a precipitation based consistency evaluation of SPRA and LPRM soil moisture retrievals indicated better skill of the SPRA product over India.

AB Land conversion and fragmentation threaten the resilience and biodiversity of wetland ecosystems which makes the future of their services to humans uncertain. Remote sensing can provide frequent and consistent data to facilitate wetland monitoring from regional to national scales and support their conservation and adaptive management. However, unique characteristics of wetlands, particularly land cover heterogeneity and background reflectance from soil, water and dead biomass, limit the efficacy of remote-sensing based metrics developed for terrestrial ecosystems. To identify the factors impacting satellite-based measurements of wetland greenness, we tested how six spectral vegetation indices responded to the land surface characteristics and regional climatic and edaphic context of 1,138 wetlands sites surveyed by the U.S EPA's National Wetland Condition Assessment. Spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) were estimated using all cloud-free surface reflectance data captured in 2011 by Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM +. We tested two annually aggregated metrics maximum and median greenness- for each SVI to facilitate the analysis of such a large dataset of satellite images. Using univariate and multivariate ordinary least square regression, we assessed how the annual maximum and median of each SVI responded to indicators of vegetation structure and composition, presence of dead biomass, open water, bare soil, and climatic/edaphic variables. Results show that, in the full national-scale dataset, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) were most responsive to field-based metrics of vegetation structure and composition. However, the responses of SVIs differed significantly among wetland types, suggesting that their use should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the monitored wetlands. Annually aggregated metrics showed different sensitivity in multivariate models, with median greenness being more sensitive to structure and composition, but also to confounding site variables including litter, open water, and bare soil. This study represents a first-time effort to study relationships between the on-site properties of wetlands and their spectral characteristics at a national scale.

AB Digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) has demonstrated utility across a range of forest environments as an alternative data source to airborne laser scanning (ALS) for estimating forest inventory attributes in an area-based approach. In this context, metrics are typically derived from the DAP point cloud in a manner analogous to that of ALS data. However, image matching algorithms also allow for spectral information from the image data to be transferred to the point cloud. Herein, we quantify the contribution of this spectral information to the area-based prediction of five forest inventory attributes: Lorey's mean height, quadratic mean diameter, basal area, gross volume per ha, and stems per ha in a highly productive coastal temperate rainforest on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Using ground plots and ALS-derived area-based estimates as reference, we compare plot-level predictions generated using (i) DAP point cloud metrics, (ii) DAP spectral metrics, and (iii) combinations of DAP point cloud and spectral metrics. In addition to prediction accuracy, we assessed variable importance to identify those metrics that were most informative for the developed models. Our results indicated that for models generated using DAP data, prediction accuracy was greatest when the point cloud-based metrics were incorporated. Models that incorporated both point cloud and spectral information were only slightly more accurate than models based on point cloud metrics only. We found that the improvement in accuracy was not observed for all stand attributes. The highest increase in accuracy for models combining point cloud and spectral metrics was observed for quadratic mean diameter, basal area per hectare, and stem volume per hectare, with change in relative root mean square error of -1.3%, -1.75%, and -0.23%, respectively. Models derived with spectral metrics only had the lowest accuracy with R-2 values never exceeding 0.25. Analysis of the variable importance indicated that point cloud metrics are markedly more important than spectral metrics. We conclude that the benefit of the additional spectral information in this forest environment is negligible, and the effort to derive the spectral information cannot be justified for operational applications. Our results confirm those of other studies in other environments that have likewise found minimal benefit to the incorporation of DAP spectral information in area-based estimation.

AB The highly intermittent and sparse nature of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) river observations in both space and time poses a major challenge to users for most applications. While interpolation/assimilation efforts exist to assemble discrete SWOT river observations into a spatially complete and temporally continuous record, the efficacy of such efforts is severely compromised by large observation gaps. In this study, we introduced spatiotemporal error correlations in runoff fields into the Inverse Streamflow Routing (ISR) model to improve the gap-filling capability for creating continuous daily discharge. This enhanced ISR model was first investigated in the Ohio River basin, which showed very significant improvements with better reproduced spatial and temporal dynamics of the runoff fields and the discharge time series. Results using 25 validation gauges showed a more concentrated Kling-Gupta Efficiency distribution, where the median was improved from 0.494 to 0.750. The enhanced ISR model was further tested over 16 representative global river basins to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The best fitted e-fold correlation length and time leading to the greatest improvements varied largely among the 16 basins. While all basins benefitted from the spatiotemporal correlations in the SWOT gap-filling, basins suffering from poorer initial guess and fewer SWOT observations, such as the Dnieper, Kolyma and Murray basins, showed larger performance gains than others. Although the experiments were idealized and did not reflect all potential errors that may be present in a real-world application, we demonstrate that the utility of SWOT river products and their value in hydrologic sciences may be boosted by expanding a local/intermittent observation platform into a far-reaching source of hydrologic information through both river hydrodynamics in channel networks and spatiotemporal coherence of runoff errors.

AB Understanding how irrigated areas change over time is vital to effectively manage limited agricultural water resources, but long-term, high-resolution, and spatially explicit datasets are rare. The High Plains Aquifer (HPA) in the central United States is one of the largest and most stressed aquifer systems in the world. It supports a $20 billion economy, but groundwater use is unsustainable over much of the aquifer. Emerging cloud computing tools like Google Earth Engine (GEE) make it possible to use the full Landsat record to monitor regional systems like the HPA with high spatial and temporal resolution over multiple decades. However, challenges remain to develop irrigation classification methods that are robust to a wide range of climate conditions and crop types, evolving management, and missing data. Here, we addressed these challenges to produce an annual, moderately high resolution (30 m) irrigation map time series from 1984 to 2017 over the aquifer. Leveraging GEE's extensive data catalog, we combined Landsat imagery, environmental covariables, and a large heterogeneous ground truth dataset to create a single random forest classifier applied annually to the entire region. Following classification, we applied the Bayesian Updating of Land-Cover (BULC) algorithm to fill imagery gaps and reduce commission errors in the provisional irrigation time series. Novel neighborhood greenness indices contributed to an overall 91.4% map accuracy across years; county statistics (r(2) = 0.86) were similarly well-matched. Trend analysis of irrigated area through time identified regions of stable, expanding, and declining irrigated area. Given declining aquifer storage, we estimate that up to 24% of currently irrigated area may be lost this century. To date, the map dataset is the longest, highest resolution large-scale record of where and when irrigation occurs. It is freely available for stakeholders, managers, and researchers to inform policies and management decisions, as well as for use in hydrology, agronomy, and climate models.

AB Accurate high-resolution maps of maximum wetland inundation extents are valuable inventorial resources, but mapping such boundaries can be difficult, time consuming and involve a level of subjectivity from the surveyor. A novel, objective and efficient method is presented for delineating the maximum inundation extents of lowland intermittent riverine wetland depressions using a high resolution LiDAR-derived digital terrain model (DTM). The method was specifically developed for wetland depressions associated with the lower reaches of the Murrumbidgee River in the southern Murray Darling Basin, Australia, but is suitable for any similar intermittent wetland depressions where the natural inundation extent is otherwise unclear. The method is based on the premise that immediately after rising water reaches a threshold level, much larger volumes of water are required to inundate not just the discrete wetland depression but also its surrounding local area; that threshold level can be considered the wetland fill level. Using a series of water levels and a corresponding series of the volume between each water level and a DTM of a wetland area, the maximum rate of increasing acceleration in volume with respect to water level, i.e. the wetland fill level, can be identified. The fill levels of eight wetland areas, ranging in size from 44 to 384 ha, were produced by this method and subsequently used to map their maximum inundation extents. Corresponding maps of the inundation frequency gradient were independently determined from a time series of Landsat derived inundation maps. The level of separation in inundation frequency of map cells inside the maximum inundation extents compared to those outside, determined by the Kolmogorov Smirnov statistic, validated the technique, while identifying that a minimum level of variation in the elevation of the wetland area may be necessary for it to be successfully applied. The technique has potential to be applied more widely as an objective and relatively inexpensive procedure to identify the potential maximum inundation extent of intermittent floodplain wetlands when a good quality high resolution DTM, acquired during a dry phase, is available.

AB Given long time series of satellite imagery, multiple disturbances can be detected for a particular location at different points in time. We assessed multiple disturbances for the 650 Mha of Canada's forested ecosystems using annual change information derived from Landsat time series imagery (1985-2015). Changes were typed by agent (fire, harvest, and non-stand replacing). Spectral change rate and time between successive disturbances were used to characterize disturbance-type combination differences. Short-term spectral recovery following the last disturbance was compared to a reference sample of pixels disturbed only once. Results indicated that of the 97.6 Mha disturbed, 13.5 Mha have had two or more disturbances, with low magnitude non-stand replacing disturbances involved in the majority of occurrences (77.2%). The total area disturbed represents 18.27% of forest ecosystems, with 2.53% having multiple disturbances and 0.54% having multiple stand-replacing disturbances. Systematic time series-based investigation of multiple disturbance events and agents provides insights on forest disturbance dynamics and recovery processes.

AB Surface Solar Irradiance (SSI) is a key parameter dictating surface-atmosphere interactions, driving radiative, hydrological, and land surface processes, and can thus impinge greatly upon weather and climate. It is thereby a prerequisite of many studies and applications. Estimating SSI from satellites began in the 1960s, and is currently the principal way to map SSI spatiotemporal distributions from regional to global scales. Starting from an overview of historical studies carried out in the past several decades, this paper reviews the progresses made in methodology, validation, and products over these years. First, the requirements of SSI in various studies or applications are presented along with the theoretical background of SSI satellite estimation. Methods to estimate SSI from satellites are then summarized as well as their advantages and limitations. Validations of satellite-based SSI on two typical spatial scales are discussed followed by a brief description of existing products and their accuracies. Finally, the challenges faced by current SSI satellite estimation are analyzed, and possible improvements to implement in the future are suggested. This review not only updates the review paper by Pinker et al. (1995) on satellite methods to derive SSI but also offers a more comprehensive summary of the related studies and applications.

AB In this paper we explore the potential of repeat-pass interferometric SAR (InSAR) for land cover classification purposes. We introduce a novel approach for the generation of large-scale thematic maps, based on the use of multi-temporal data, acquired over short observation intervals (short-time-series). A larger interferometric coherence loss is expected with the increasing time difference between two interferometric acquisitions. This phenomenon is normally indicated as temporal decorrelation whose amount differs depending on the type of imaged target on ground. The basic idea is therefore to accurately model the evolution in time of the temporal decorrelation and use the estimated parameters, together with backscatter, as input features for the Random Forest machine learning classification algorithm. The work has been carried out on the case study of land cover mapping over central Europe, considering Sentinel-1 C-band interferometric stacks, acquired over a time span of about one month. Three different land cover classes have been considered: artificial surfaces as e.g. urban areas, forests, and non-forested areas as the ensemble of low vegetation, bare soil, and agricultural areas. The results show a level of agreement above 91%, when compared to the CORINE land cover map product of 2012, which has been used as external reference for both training and testing of the classification algorithm.

AB The Forel-Ule (FU) color comparator scale is the oldest set of optical water types (OWTs). This scale was originally developed for visual comparison and generated an immense amount of data, with hundreds of thousands of observations being gathered from the last 130 years. Since recently, the FU scale is also applicable to remote sensing data. This has been possible thanks to an optical characterization of the 21 FU colors in terms of the (x,y) CIE standards and new algorithms that convert remote-sensing reflectances (R-rs) from satellite-borne ocean color sensors to FU. R-rs-derived hue angle and FU have been recently applied with success in the assessment of color variability of lakes and specific shelf areas, but an evaluation over global oceanic waters is still missing. By clustering global climatological ESAOC-CCI v2.0 R-rs with the derived FU, we obtain a set of R-rs to be used as optical water types (OWTs). Diffuse attenuation coefficient, Secchi disk depth and chlorophyll concentration are also associated to the FU classes. The angular distances of a given R-rs to the two nearest FU classes are proposed as simple and robust membership indexes, adding up to one. We also evaluate the advantages and limitations of FU and the hue angle as monitoring tools over the full marine range, from the most oligotrophic areas to the turbid and productive coastal zones. The first 7 FU indexes cover 99% of global surface waters. Unlike the hue angle, that resolves all spatio-temporal color variations, the FU scale is coarse as a monitoring tool for oligotrophic waters as all the subtropical gyres saturate to FU = 1, while the color of other seas varies across 2, 3 or even 4 FU classes. We illustrate the introduction of a new "zero" FU class that increases monitoring resolution at the blue end of the color range. Finally, we show how optical diversity varies across the color range and compare several sets of OWTs from a color perspective. Overall, we provide a valuable and self-consistent dataset that enhances the usefulness of the FU scale by converting it to useful information for the oceanographic community. This OWT scheme keeps the advantages of other datasets, like being useful to study ocean color product quality and characterize the uncertainties, but also allows to continue to monitor long-term change in optical diversity over the global ocean color. Integration into the optical modules of ecosystem models can help verify past simulations that predate the satellite age, through comparisons with in-situ FU data collected at the time.

AB The free-availability of global coverage Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data provides the opportunity for systematic generation of medium spatial resolution land products. This paper presents a combined Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 burned area mapping algorithm. The data handling integrates recent research on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 preprocessing to generate registered, surface nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) sensor time series that are used as an input. The different sensor data are combined through a random forest change regression, trained with synthetic data built from laboratory and field spectra and using a spectral model of fire effects on reflectance. The random forest regression is applied independently at each gridded 30 m pixel location on a temporally rolling basis considering three months of sensor data to map the central month. Temporal consistency checks are used to reduce commission errors due to non-fire related spectral changes, and a region growing algorithm is used to reduce omission errors due to temporally sparse observations. In the resulting product, each 30 m pixel is labelled as burned, unburned or unmapped. At burned pixels the estimated day of burning, and a single value that provides an estimate of the product of the subpixel fraction burned (f) and the combustion completeness (cc), henceforth termed "f.cc", and an associated quality measure, are defined. The algorithm is demonstrated using six months of every available Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A acquisition over 10 degrees x 10 degrees of Southern Africa. Experiments comparing the mapped burned areas considering Sentinel-2A only and both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A data indicate a greater area burned and a smaller number of unmapped pixels when both sensors are used. The results are compared with contemporaneous NASA MODIS fire products to gain insights into their temporal and spatial reporting differences. Temporally, the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 30 m product reports the day of burning on average three days later than the MODIS 500 m burned area product, because of the lower revisit frequency of the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 observations. Spatially, the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 30 m product captures more detail than the MODIS 500 m burned area product, with systematically higher burned area estimates. Despite the areal differences, the spatial pattern of the two products is similar, as reflected by the correlation (r(2) similar to 0.7) and slope (> 0.8) of regressions of the proportions of area burned defined in coarse resolution cells between the two products, taking into account the 3 day temporal bias. A comparison with multi-date PLANET 3 m data, shows high visual agreement in the location and approximate day of burning and higher f.cc values in the interiors of distinct burns than at the edges, and lower values in areas containing mixes of burned and unburned 3 m pixels. The Landsat-8/Sentinel-2A burned area mapping results are validated by comparison with burned areas interpreted visually from two date Sentinel-2A data, over 30 km x 30 km boxes selected by systematic sampling. The results mapped less area burned than the interpreted maps, as reflected by a 0.24 omission error and a negative relative bias (0.19), with a small 0.06 commission error. Regression between the proportions of area burned defined in 1.5 km cells provide a high correlation (r(2) = 0.89) and slope close to unity (0.82) and indicate that the Landsat-8/Sentinel-2A results identified similar burned area spatial patterns as the interpreted maps.

   microwave radiometry using regularization

AB Soil and vegetation water content are closely coupled via complex physiological and ecohydrological processes. Joint passive microwave retrievals of soil moisture theta and vegetation optical depth tau potentially provide unparalleled insight into these couplings on a global scale. However, this requires careful data analyses. Using a novel coupling distortion metric R-s(2), we show that snapshot dual-polarization retrievals of tau and theta-widely used in vegetation studies - are spuriously correlated for SMAP L-band observations. Naive estimates of tau-theta coupling metrics are thus grossly distorted across a range of time scales. To mitigate the spurious correlations, we introduce a regularized retrieval algorithm. Our regularization algorithm exploits the assumed slowly changing nature of tau by penalizing rapid variations in the tau estimates. The degree of regularization r must balance a trade-off, as we find overregularization due to the oversmoothing of tau also distorts coupling estimates. When r is chosen to balance the trade-off according to R-s(2), the spurious correlations are found to essentially vanish. The estimates of tau-theta correlation change substantially compared to non-regularized retrievals. The changes are largest (similar to 0.5) over high-biomass at time scales of up to two weeks, but sizeable differences are also found on longer time scales. Our analyses show that estimating vegetation-soil moisture coupling metrics benefits from dedicated retrievals and data analysis approaches. Provided the uncertainties are carefully accounted for, satellite radiometry offers exciting opportunities to study ecohydrological interactions such as plant water uptake and hydraulics.

AB In this present study, an aerosol effective height (AEH) retrieval algorithm has been developed using the O-4 air mass factor (AMF) at 477 nm from the hyperspectral Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We investigated the magnitude of change in topographical and seasonal O-4 vertical column density (VCD) in Northeast Asia and evaluated its effect on AEH retrieval accuracy using our AEH retrieval algorithm. In addition, the effect of a temperature-dependent cross-section for O-4 (TDCS) on Look Up Table (LUT)-based AEH retrieval accuracy was quantified. A comparison between the retrieved AEH and those from the NIES lidar network for the period from January 2005 to June 2009, applying both the TDCS and the seasonal and topographical O-4 VCDs, resulted in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.44 km for both smoke and dust aerosols. However, when both a TDCS (an O-4 absorption cross-section at a single temperature of 293 K; SCS) and a single O-4 VCD value were applied to the LUT, the RMSE for both aerosol types was calculated to be 0.52 km (0.51 km), which implies that TDCS contributes most to AEH retrieval accuracy when accurate O-4 VCDs are applied to the LUT. For smoke aerosols only, both TDCS and multiple O-4 VCD (SCS and single O-4 VCD) applications had RMSE values of 0.46 km (0.66 km). The retrieved AEHs were additionally compared with satellite-based lidar measurements. We also investigated the effects of uncertainties in our algorithm input data (e.g., O-4 VCD, TDCS, AOD, and surface reflectance) on AEH retrieval error using synthetic radiances. Large errors can be caused by uncertainties in O-4 VCD and AOD. In particular (0.4 <= AOD < 1.0), O-4 VCD uncertainty led to AEH errors 0.96 km. However, the effect of uncertainty of TDCS on AEH retrieval is much smaller than that of O-4 VCD, which agrees with a small contribution of TDCS to an improvement of AEH retrieval accuracy found in the comparison between the lidar data and the retrieved AEH with the TDCS LUT.

AB The use of remote sensing observation to estimate subsurface oceanic variables, including subsurface temperature anomaly (STA), is essential for the study of ocean dynamics and climate change. Here we report a new method that combines a pre-clustering process and a neural network (NN) approach to determine the STA using ocean surface temperature, surface height, and surface wind observation data at the global scale. Gridded monthly Argo data were used in the training and validation procedures of the method. Results show that the pre-clustered NN method was better than the same method without clustering, while also outperforming a clustered linear regressor and the random forest method recently reported. The new method was tested over a wide range of time (all months from 2004 to 2010) and depth (down to 1900 m). Overall, our best estimation resulted in an overall root-mean-squared error of 0.41 degrees C and a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.91 at the 50 m level for all months. The R-2 decreased to 0.51 at 300 m but was still better than the calculation without pre-clustering. This method can be expanded to estimate other key oceanic variables and provide new insights in understanding the climate system.

AB Artificial nighttime lights (NTL) generated by human activities offer a unique opportunity to understand urban environments. Although previous studies have widely used NTL images to map urban extent at multiple scales, it remains a challenging task to address how NTL respond exactly to urbanization and thus to map urbanization from NTL. In this study, using monthly Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership/Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP/VIIRS) NTL images between 2013 and 2017, we developed a method to decompose time-series NTL signal into annual and seasonal components. Further, we proposed an NTL-based indicator for the detection of impervious surfaces change (ISC) by integrating annual increment and seasonal variation of NTL brightness. The indicator was then used to identify ISC by using a thresholding method. The application of the methodology in the conterminous United States (CONUS) revealed a more rapid urbanization in the southern CONUS than the northern states and a northeastern-southwestern gradient of NTL seasonality. It was also found that NTL of November and December provided the most accurate characterization of urban extent for most areas in the CONUS. The detection of ISC in four representative regions (i.e. Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, greater Washington D.C., Denver-Aurora, and Atlanta) resulted in a moderate to high accuracy with the overall accuracy of similar to 80% and the Kappa value ranging from 0.56 to 0.73. Despite of this, the results showed a low accuracy of NTL-derived changing year of ISC (Kappa: 0.28) because of the existence of temporal inconsistency between NTL increase and ISC. The proposed method has the potential to timely map urban expansion at large geographical scales (e.g., continental and global) in a cost-efficient manner.

AB In this study, we revised a two source energy balance model (G(c)-TSEB) that is based on canopy conductance and soil moisture in evapotranspiration (ET) estimation. We estimate soil evaporation (E) using the complementary concept and soil surface temperature, therefore, the revised G(c)-TSEB requires no soil moisture as input. We tested G(c)-TSEB at 10 flux sites under various land cover and climate conditions. The flux-calibrated G(c)-TSEB performed well in ET predictions, with determinant coefficients (R-2) larger than 0.9 at most of the sites. The modeled transpiration was highly correlated with the Gross Primary Production, indicating the usefulness of the model in ET partitioning. More importantly, G(c)-TSEB can be calibrated against the land surface temperature (LST), which is operationally available using remote sensing technique. Overall, daily ET that was predicted by the LST-calibrated G(c)-TSEB generally matched the trends of the ET measurements at most of the sites, and R-2 range from 0.63 to 0.93, with a median of 0.80, at all sites. Transpiration estimation was highly consistent with the simulations from the flux-calibrated model. Moreover, in vegetated surfaces, soil evaporation was estimated reasonably well using the LST-calibrated G(c)-TSEB. However, positive biases are prevalent when vegetated fraction is smaller than 0.2, especially in cold regions because of the dramatic differences in evaporation process between summer and winter. To improve model performances, calibrating G(c)-TSEB model in separated periods and using prior knowledge as constraints proved to be useful.

AB Vegetation plays an important role in the climate system. The extent to which vegetation impacts climate through its structure and function varies across space and time, and it is also affected by land cover changes. In areas with both multiple growing periods and significant land cover changes, such as the Horn of Africa, identifying vegetation influence on land surface temperature (LST) through radiative changes needs further investigation. In this study, we used a 13-year time series (2001 - 2013) of remotely sensed environmental data to estimate the contribution of radiative mechanism to LST change due to growing season albedo dynamics and land cover conversion. Our results revealed that in taller woody vegetation (forest and savanna), albedo increases during the growing period by up to 0.04 compared with the non-growing period, while it decreases in shorter vegetation (grassland and shrubland) by up to 0.03. The warming impact due to a decrease in albedo during the growing period in shorter vegetation is counteracted by a considerable increase in evapotranspiration, leading to net cooling. Analysis of land cover change impact on albedo showed a regional annual average instantaneous surface radiative forcing of -0.03 +/- 0.02 W m(-2). The land cover transitions from forest to cropland, and savanna to grassland, displayed the largest mean albedo increase across all seasons, causing an average instantaneous surface radiative forcing of -2.6 W m(-2) and -1.5 W m(-2) and a decrease in mean LST of 0.12 K and 0.09 K, all in dry period (December, January, February), respectively. Despite the albedo cooling effect in these conversions, an average net warming of 1.3 K and 0.23 K was observed under the dominant influence of non-radiative mechanisms. These results show that the impact of radiative mechanism was small, highlighting the importance of non-radiative processes in understanding the climatic impacts of land cover changes, as well as in delineating effective mitigation strategies.

AB Coastal altimetry products are available and are being extensively validated. Their accuracy has been assessed in many coastal zones around the world and they are ready for exploitation near the shore. This opens a variety of applications of the sea level data obtained from the specific reprocessing of radar altimeter signals in the coastal strip. In this work, we retracked altimeter waveforms of the European Space Agency satellites: ERS-2 RA and Envisat RA-2 from descending track (#0360) over the eastern side of the Strait of Gibraltar using the Adaptive Leading Edge Sub-waveform (ALES) retracker. We estimated along-track Sea Level Anomaly (AT_SLA) profiles (RA-2) at high posting rate (18 Hz) using improved range and geophysical corrections. Tides were removed with a global model (DTU10) that displays a good performance in the study area: the mean root square sum (RSS) of the main constituents obtained with DTU10 and 11 tide gauge stations was 4.3 cm in agreement with the RSS using a high-resolution local hydrodynamic model (UCA2.5D) (4.2 cm). We also estimated a local mean sea surface by reprocessing ERS-2/Envisat waveforms (track #0360) with ALES. The use of this local model gave more realistic AT_SLA than the values obtained with the global model DTU15MSS. Finally, the along-track Absolute Dynamic Topography (AT_ADT) was estimated using a local Mean Dynamic Topography obtained with the local hydrodynamic model UCA2.5D. We analysed the cross-strait variability of the sea level difference between the African/Spanish coasts along the selected track segment. This was compared to the sea level cross-strait difference from the records of two tide gauges located in the African (Ceuta) and Spanish (Tarifa) coasts. The sea level differences from altimetry and tide gauges were linked to the zonal component of the wind. We found a positive and significant ( > 95% c.l.) correlation between easterlies/westerlies and positive/negative cross-strait sea level differences between the southern and northern coasts of the Strait in both datasets (altimetry: r = 0.54 and in-situ: r = 0.82).

AB River discharge is an important variable in the water cycle that is related to water supply, irrigation, and flood forecasting. However, gauging stations are extremely limited across most high-mountain regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the Asia's water towers. Remote sensing, in combination with partial in situ discharge measurements, bridges the gap in monitoring river discharge over ungauged and poorly gauged basins. Of great importance for the successful retrieval of river discharge using remote sensing are river width (water surface area) and water level (water surface elevation), but it is challenging to retrieve accurate discharge values for high-mountain regions because of narrow river channels, complex terrain, and limited observations from a single satellite platform. Here, we used 1237 high-spatial-resolution images (Landsat series and Sentinel 1/2) to derive water surface areas with the Google Earth Engine (GEE), and satellite altimetry (Jason-2/3 and Satellite with Argos and AltiKa (SARAL/Altika)) to derive water levels for the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR, the Yarlung Zangbo River in China) in the TP where the river width is typically less than 400 m. Using three power function equations, discharge was estimated for cross-sections around the four gauging stations in the UBR with triangular cross-sections outperforming their trapezoidal counterparts. It was also found that the equation combining both river width and water level produced the best discharge estimates whereas the other two equations (requiring either river width or water level as the input data) were complementary and could be used to extend the time series of discharge estimates. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient values for the discharge estimates range from 0.68 to 0.98 during the study period 2000-2017. The proposed method is feasible to estimate discharge in the UBR and potentially other high-mountain rivers globally.

AB The sea state bias (SSB) is a large source of uncertainty in the estimation of sea level from satellite altimetry. It is still unclear to what extent it depends on errors in parameter estimations (numerical source) or to the wave physics (physical source).
   By improving the application of this correction we compute 20-Hz sea level anomalies that are about 30% more precise (i.e. less noisy) than the current standards. The improvement is two-fold: first we prove that the SSB correction should be applied directly to the 20-Hz data (12 to 19% noise decrease); secondly, we show that by recomputing a regional SSB model (based on the 20-Hz estimations) even a simple parametric relation is sufficient to further improve the correction (further 15 to 19% noise decrease).
   We test our methodology using range, wave height and wind speed estimated with two retrackers applied to Jason-1 waveform data: the MLE4 retracked-data available in the Sensor Geophysical Data Records of the mission and the ALES retracked-data available in the OpenADB repository (https://openadb.dgfi.tum.de/). The regional SSB models are computed parametrically by means of a crossover analysis in the Mediterranean Sea and North Sea.
   Correcting the high-rate data for the SSB reduces the correlation between retracked parameters. Regional variations in the proposed models might be due to differences in wave climate and remaining sea-state dependent residual errors. The variations in the empirical model with respect to the retracker used recall the need for a specific SSB correction for any retracker.
   This study, while providing a significantly more precise solution to exploit high-rate sea level data, calls for a re-thinking of the SSB correction in both its physical and numerical component, gives robustness to previous theories and provides an immediate improvement for the application of satellite altimetry in the regions of study.

AB A large proportion of the global land surface is covered by pasture. The advent of the Sentinel satellites program provides free datasets with good spatiotemporal resolution that can be a valuable source of information for monitoring pasture resources. We combined optical remote sensing data (proximal hyperspectral and Sentinel 2A) with a radiative transfer model (PROSAIL) to estimate leaf Area Index (LAI), and biomass, in a dairy farming context. Three sites in Southern England were used: two pasture farms that differed in pasture type and management, and a set of small agronomy trial plots with different mixtures of grasses, legumes and herbs, as well as pure perennial ryegrass. The proximal and satellite spectral data were used to retrieve LAI via PROSAIL model inversion, which were compared against field observations of LAI. The potential of bands of Sentinel 2A that corresponded with a 10 m resolution was studied by convolving narrow spectral bands (from a handheld hyperspectral sensor) into Sentinel 2A bands (10 m). Retrieved LAI, using these spectrally resampled S2A data, compared well with measured LAI, for all sites, even for those with mixed species cover (although retrieved LAI was somewhat overestimated for pasture mixtures with high LAI). This proved the suitability of 10 m Sentinel 2A spectral bands for capturing LAI dynamics for different types of pastures. We also found that inclusion of 20 m bands in the inversion scheme did not lead to any further improvement in retrieved LAI. Sentinel 2A image based retrieval yielded good agreement with LAI measurements obtained for a typical perennial ryegrass based pasture farm. LAI retrieved in this way was used to create biomass maps (that correspond to indirect biomass measurements by Rising Plate Meter (RPM)), for mixed-species paddocks for a farm for which limited field data were available. These maps compared moderately well with farmer-collected RPM measurements for this farm. We propose that estimates of paddock-averaged and within-paddock variability of biomass are more reliably obtained from a combined Sentinel 2A-PROSAIL approach, rather than by manual RPM measurements. The physically based radiative transfer model inversion approach outperformed the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index based retrieval method, and does not require site specific calibrations of the inversion scheme.

AB Widespread increases in the productivity of tundra ecosystems and static trends or even declines in boreal ecosystems have been detected since the early 1980s using coarse-scale remote sensing. However, intermediate scale Landsat studies have shown that these changes are heterogeneous and may be related to landscape and regional variability in climate, land cover, topography and moisture availability. In this study, a Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series (1984-2016) was examined for an area spanning the transition from sub-Arctic boreal forest to Low Arctic tundra in central Canada. This was supplemented by analyses of relationships with a suite of environmental variables and in situ measurements of bulk vegetation volume. Results show that NDVI trends were generally positive (i.e. increasing) across the study area but were smallest in the forest zone and largest in the northern tundra zone. More than one-quarter (27%) of un-masked pixels exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) trend and virtually all (99.3%) of those pixels exhibited an increasing, or "greening", trend. Greening pixels were most common in the northern tundra zone and the southern ecotone zone. Random Forest modeling of the relationship between NDVI and environmental variables indicated that the magnitude and direction of trends varied across the forest to tundra transition. Areas that experienced larger increases in NDVI include: (i) areas where summer temperatures increased; (ii) areas exhibiting predominantly shrub and forest cover; and (iii) locations closer to major drainage systems, further from major lakes, and at lower elevations. Ground validation in the central portion of the study area reveals a strong relationship (R-2 = 0.79) between vegetation volume and NDVI for non-tree functional groups and that alder (Alnus crispa) shrublands and open spruce (Picea mariana and P. glauca) woodland with shrubby understories were most likely to exhibit greening. These findings indicate that the largest positive and more significant NDVI trends were associated with increased productivity in shrub-dominated environments, especially at, and north of the treeline in localities with favorable growing conditions. Smaller and less significant NDVI trends in boreal forest environments south of the treeline were likely associated with long-term successional change following disturbance rather than the variables analyzed here.

AB High spatiotemporal resolution air temperature (Ta) datasets are increasingly needed for assessing the impact of temperature change on people, ecosystems, and energy system, especially in the urban domains. However, such datasets are not widely available because of the large spatiotemporal heterogeneity of Ta caused by complex biophysical and socioeconomic factors such as built infrastructure and human activities. In this study, we developed a 1 km gridded dataset of daily minimum Ta (Tmin) and maximum Ta (Tmax), and the associated uncertainties, in urban and surrounding areas in the conterminous U.S. for the 2003-2016 period. Daily geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were developed and used to interpolate Ta using 1 km daily land surface temperature and elevation as explanatory variables. The leave-one-out cross-validation approach indicates that our method performs reasonably well, with root mean square errors of 2.1 degrees C and 1.9 degrees C, mean absolute errors of 1.5 degrees C and 1.3 degrees C, and R 2 of 0.95 and 0.97, for Tmin and Tmax, respectively. The resulting dataset captures reasonably the spatial heterogeneity of Ta in the urban areas, and also captures effectively the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon that Ta rises with the increase of urban development (i.e., impervious surface area). The new dataset is valuable for studying environmental impacts of urbanization such as UHI and other related effects (e.g., on building energy consumption and human health). The proposed methodology also shows a potential to build a long-term record of Ta worldwide, to fill the data gap that currently exists for studies of urban systems.

AB In this study, the segmented particle swarm optimization (SPSO) algorithm and the concepts of the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm (GBDT) were combined to propose the SPSO adaptive neural network (SANN) method. The purpose of this method is to address the inadequacies of the traditional basis function (BP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks when solving problems that involve local optima and overfitting. Experimental results indicated that, overall, the SANN method is accurate in remote-sensing estimations of aquatic vegetation biomass. However, accuracies of estimations were unsatisfactory for certain indicators and sessions when data was taken. The estimations were analyzed using three sets of indicators: (i) root mean square error, average relative error, and total relative error; (ii) correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination, and their scatter plots; and (iii) relative error values and their distributions. The results clearly showed that the SANN method was superior to the BP neural network as well as the stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (SR). However, when the relative errors in biomass estimations by the other two methods were low, the advantages of the SANN method were less pronounced. This was particularly true when the relative errors were < 30%, in which case SANN was only marginally better than the other two methods.

AB Monitoring of the southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) population via satellite imagery was first proposed in 1980. However, the imagery that was available at that time was inadequate for the task as it did not permit the direct observation and counting of warrens. Since then, advances in the availability and resolution of satellite imagery mean that it is now possible to map the entire distribution of southern hairy-nosed wombats and to estimate their population abundance using very high-resolution imagery (<= 1.0 m). However, other landscape features such as rabbit warrens can make the identification of wombat warrens problematic, and not all wombat warrens are visible, even in the best resolution imagery. By comparing data that we collected from field surveys conducted between May 2015 - May 2017 with satellite imagery we could identify that many wombat warrens have visible trails linking warrens with each other. Whilst this allowed us to differentiate between wombat and rabbit warrens in most circumstances, the lack of visible trails in some instances highlighted the need for ground truthing surveys to be conducted as part of any broad scale wombat population survey. Based on the difference between the number of warrens that we marked during our ground surveys with the number which were visible in the satellite imagery, we calculated a range of indices which can be used to correct future broad-scale population estimates based on satellite imagery, to account for warrens which may be obscured by vegetation and other confounding factors.

AB The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), launched in July 2014, is capable of measuring Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), a functional proxy for terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). Although its primary mission is to measure the column-averaged mixing ratio of CO2 (Xco(2)) to constrain global carbon source/sink distribution, one of the OCO-2 spectrometers allows for a robust SIF retrieval solely based on solar Fraunhofer lines. Here we present a technical overview of the OCO-2 SIF product, aiming to provide the scientific community guidance on best practices for data analysis, interpretation, and application. This overview consists of the retrieval algorithms, OCO-2 specific bias correction, retrieval uncertainty evaluation, cross-mission comparison with other existing SIF products, and a global-scale examination of the SIF-GPP relationship. With the initial three years of data (September 2014 onward), we compared OCO-2 SIF with retrievals from Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and examined its relationship with FLUXCOM and MODIS GPP datasets. Our results show that OCO-2 SIF, along with GOSAT products, closely resemble the mean spatial and temporal patterns of FLUXCOM GPP from regions to the globe. Compared with GOME-2, however, OCO-2 depicts a more realistic spatial contrast between the tropics and extra-tropics. The linear relationship between OCO-2 SIF and existing modeled GPP products diverges somewhat across biomes at the global scale, consistent with previous GOSAT or GOME-2 based findings when modeled GPP products were used, but in contrast to a consistent cross-biome SIF-GPP relationship obtained at flux tower sites with OCO-2 products. This contrast suggests a critical need to reconcile differences in diverse SIF and GPP products and the relationships among them. Overall, the OCO-2 SIF products are robust and valuable for monitoring the global terrestrial carbon cycle and for constraining the carbon source/sink strengths of the Earth system. Finally, insights are offered for future satellite missions optimized for SIF retrievals.

AB Natural disturbances significantly influence forest ecosystem services and biodiversity. Accurate delineation and early detection of areas affected by wind and insect outbreaks are crucial for guiding management decisions. To this end, past studies relied mostly on passive sensors (e.g., optical), and active sensors (i.e., radar) were rarely used. This study used L-band space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) within a change-detection framework to delineate forested areas affected by wind and insect disturbances. The results showed that changes in back scatter relate to damage caused by wind and insect outbreaks. Overall accuracies of 69-84% and 65-88% were obtained for delineation of areas affected by wind damage and insect outbreaks, respectively, depending on the acquisition date and environmental conditions. Areas susceptible to insect outbreaks or experiencing the initial outbreak phase (green) were detected with lower accuracies (64-74%). It is expected that L-band space-borne SAR data can be applied over larger areas and ecosystem types in the temperate and boreal regions to delineate and detect damaged areas.

AB Accurately characterizing spatiotemporal changes in surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) is a prerequisite for sustainable urban development. Although urban administrative boundaries have typically been used for SUHI modeling, they are inaccurate, because urban main built-up areas (UMBAs) are not well characterized. In this study, we developed an UMBA extraction method based on impervious surface distribution density (ISDD), to better differentiate suburban boundaries and ensure the integrity of land cover types. Additionally, we propose a new intensity classification method to analyze SUHI spatial distribution and variation. The UMBA was extracted using LANDSAT-8 data, and the temporal dynamics of SUHI intensity (i.e., daily, monthly, seasonal, and yearly changes) were extracted from MODIS data. A case study for Beijing showed that the mean daytime and nocturnal SUHI intensities vary at multiple time scales. In the daytime, SUHI intensities in Beijing UMBA were mainly level-2 and level-3, with central-south Beijing, a high incidence area, at level-3 in spring and summer. At night, with the rise of SUHI intensity levels, the frequency of SUHI intensity levels increased from the periphery to the center within the same season. ISDD had a marked influence on the frequency of SUHI intensity levels during the daytime, and the frequencies of level-1 to level-4 intensities increased with ISDD. This influence tended to weaken when ISDD exceeded 50%.

AB The spatial distribution and fractional cover of plant functional types (PFTs) is a key uncertainty in land surface models (LSMs) that is closely linked to uncertainties in global carbon, hydrology and energy budgets. Land cover is considered to be an Essential Climate Variable because changes in it can result in local, regional or global scale impacts on climate. In LSMs, land cover (LC) class maps are converted to PFT fractional maps using a cross walking (CW) table by prescribing the fraction of each PFT that occurs within each LC class. In this study we assess the largest plausible range of PFT uncertainty derived from remotely sensed LC maps produced under the European Space Agency Land Cover Climate Change Initiative on simulations of land surface fluxes using 3 leading LSMs. We evaluate the impact of uncertainty due to both LC classification algorithms, and CW procedure, on energy, moisture and carbon fluxes in LSMs. We investigate the maximum plausible range of uncertainty deriving from both LC and CW within the context of a potential biomass scale (bare ground-grass shrub-tree), representing a gradient from low to high biomass PFTs. More specifically, plausible alternative land cover maps and associated PFT fractional distributions were produced to prioritise low or high biomass vegetation in the LC classification (uncertainty in LC), and subsequently in the assignment of PFT fractions for each LC class (uncertainty in CW), relative to a reference PFT distribution.
   We examined the impact of PFT uncertainty on 3 key variables in the carbon, water and energy cycles (gross primary production (GPP), evapo-transpiration (ET), and albedo), for 3 LSMs (JSBACH, JULES and ORCHIDEE) at global scale. Results showed a greater uncertainty in PFT fraction due to CW as opposed to LC uncertainty, for all three variables. CW uncertainty in tree fraction was found to be particularly important in the northern boreal forests for simulated LSM albedo. Uncertainty in the balance between grass and bare soil fraction in arid parts of Africa, central Asia, and central Australia was also found to influence albedo and ET in all models. The spread due to PFT uncertainty for albedo was between 30 and 105% of inter-model uncertainty, for GPP between 20 and 90%, and for ET 0-30%. Each model had a different sensitivity to PFT uncertainty, for example, GPP in JSBACH was found to have a much higher sensitivity to PFT uncertainty in the tropics than JULES and ORCHIDEE, whereas the inverse was true for ET.
   These results show that inter-model uncertainty for key variables in LSMs can be reduced by more accurate representation of PFT distributions. Future efforts in land cover mapping should therefore be focused on reducing CW uncertainty through better understanding of the fractional cover of PFTs within a land cover class. Efforts to reduce LC uncertainty should particularly be focused on more accurate mapping of grass and bare soil fractions in arid areas. In the context of Land Surface Models, these results demonstrate that prescribed vegetation distribution in models is a key source of uncertainty that is comparable to the spread between models for key model state variables.

AB Very high resolution (VHR) satellite data is experiencing rapid annual growth, producing petabytes of remotely sensed data per year. The WorldView constellation, operated by DigitalGlobe, images over 1.2 billion km(2) annually at <2 m spatial resolution. Due to computation, data cost, and methodological concerns, VHR satellite data has mainly been used to produce needed geospatial information for site-specific phenomena. This project produced a VHR spatiotemporally explicit wall-to-wall cropland area map for the rainfed residential cropland mosaic of the Tigray Region, Ethiopia, which is comprised mostly of smallholder farms. Moderate resolution satellite data do not have adequate spatial resolution to capture the total area occupied by smallholder farms, i.e., farms with agricultural fields of <= 45 x 45 m in dimension. In order to accurately map smallholder cropped area over a large region, hundreds of VHR images spanning two or more years are needed. Sub-meter WorldView-1 and WorldView-2 segmentation results were combined with median phenology amplitude from Landsat 8 data to map cropped area. Over 2700 VHR WorldView-1, -2 data were obtained from the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) via the NextView license agreement and were processed from raw imagery to produce a smallholder crop map in similar to 1 week using a semi-automated method with the large computing capacity of the Advanced Data Analytics Platform. We estimated cropped area in Tigray to be 46% with a commission error of 5% +/- 10% and omission error of 15% +/- 12%. This methodology is extensible to other regions with similar vegetation texture and can easily be expanded to run on much larger regions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The European Space Agency's Sentinel-2A mission with the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard was launched in 2015, initiating a new era in high-to-moderate-resolution (i.e., 10 to 60 m) imaging of Earth's resources. This manuscript describes the implementations of MSI processing into the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) and provides qualitative and quantitative analyses of remote sensing reflectance products (Rrs), which are essential in the retrievals of near-surface concentrations of water constituents in aquatic systems. In situ validations and intercomparisons of MSI-derived 11 products with those derived from Landsat-8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) both indicated reasonable products in coastal/inland waters. Following vicarious calibrations using reference in situ water-leaving radiances, the overall absolute relative differences and the root mean squared differences (RMSD) found for the matchup analyses were, < 7% and < 0.0012 1/sr, respectively, for the blue and green bands. With preliminary indications of consistency with the OLI products and very good agreements with in situ data, a time-series plot of total suspended solids (TSS) product derived from both missions was produced and analyzed for an inland system. It is surmised that frequent moderate-to-high resolution R products from the combined Sentinel-2A (and 13) and Landsat-8 missions are now available to the science/user community for developing algorithms suited for coastal/inland waters. Nonetheless, further research needs to be dedicated to a) improving atmospheric corrections over bodies of waters rich in dissolved organic matter or suspended particles, b) mitigating the impact of haze-or sea surface-reflected solar radiations at low solar zenith angles, and c) minimizing image artifacts to maximize the use of multi-mission products.

AB To classify trees along a spectrum of isohydric to anisohydric behavior is a promising new framework for identifying tree species' sensitivities to drought stress, directly related to the vulnerability of carbon uptake of terrestrial ecosystems with increased hydroclimate variability. Trees with isohydric strategies regulate stomatal conductance to maintain stationary leaf water potential, while trees with anisohydric strategies allow leaf water potential to fall, which in the absence of significant hydraulic cavitation will facilitate greater rates of carbon uptake. Despite the recognition of the gas exchange consequences of isohydric and anisohydric strategies for individual tree species, there have been few studies regarding whether isohydric trees produces distinct spectral signatures under drought stress that can be remotely sensed. Here, we examined the capability of four vegetation indices (PRI, NDVI, NDVI705, and EVI) to capture the differences in spectral responses between isohydric and anisohydric trees within a deciduous forest in central Indiana, USA. Both leaf-level spectral measurements and canopy-scale satellite observations were used to compare peak growing-season spectral signatures between a drought and a non-drought year. At the leaf scale, two vegetation indices (NDVI and NDVI705) failed to capture the drought signal or the divergent isohydric/anisohydric behavior. EVI successfully captured the drought signal at both leaf and canopy scales, but failed to capture the divergent behavior between isohydric and anisohydric tree species during the drought. PRI captured both drought signals and divergent isohydric/anisohydric behavior at both leaf and canopy scales once normalized between sunlit (backward direction images) and shaded (forward direction images) portions of canopy, which indicates drought stress and subsequent photosynthetic down regulation are greater in the sunlit portion of canopy. This study presents a significant step forward in our ability to directly mapping emergent isohydricity at different scales based on divergent spectral signatures between sunlit and shaded canopies.

TI Hurricane Isaac storm surges off Florida observed by Jason-1 and Jason-2
   satellite altimeters
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID OCEAN RESPONSE; CURRENTS; EXAMPLE
AB Storm surges can cause damage to properties and loss of life in coastal communities. Thus it is important to enhance our capabilities of observing, understanding and forecasting storm surges for mitigating damage and loss. Previous studies have shown that cross-shelf altimetric sea surface height profiles can be used to determine storm surge features. In this study we combine satellite altimetry with tide-gauge data to study storm surge features off Florida in the Gulf of Mexico during Hurricane Isaac 2012. Satellite observations show a storm surge of about 0.8 m near Cedar Key and Apalachicola decreasing westward and southward in the early morning of August 28, 2012 (UTC), consistent with tide-gauge measurements. Our analysis of satellite data reveals that the storm surge propagates northward from Naples to Cedar Key with a phase speed of 14-16 m/s and a cross-shelf decay scale of 190-220 km, in approximate agreement with the estimates from tide-gauge data. In contrast, an analysis of tide-gauge data reveals that the storm surge propagates westward from Apalachicola to Pensacola with a phase speed of 6-7 m/s and a cross-shelf decay scale of about 85 km. It is further shown that the post-storm sea level variations at these stations are associated with first-mode continental shelf waves. The present study shows that along-shelf altimetric sea surface height profiles can be useful to observe and understand storm surge features as cross-shelf ones demonstrated previously, of importance to improvement of storm surge forecasting. It suggests that a constellation of altimeter missions especially with wide-swath altimetry could be suited to monitor storm surges. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV), developed by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), capitalizes on the long temporal availability of Landsat imagery to identify burned areas across the conterminous United States (CONUS) (1984-2015). Adequate validation of such products is critical for their proper usage and interpretation. Validation of coarse-resolution products often relies on independent data derived from moderate resolution sensors (e.g., Landsat). Validation of Landsat products, in turn, is challenging because there is no corresponding source of high-resolution, multispectral imagery that has been systematically collected in space and time over the entire temporal extent of the Landsat archive. Because of this, comparison between high-resolution images and Landsat science products can help increase user's confidence in the Landsat science products, but may not, alone, be adequate. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to systematically validate the Landsat-derived BAECV product. Burned area extent was mapped for Landsat image pairs using a manually trained semi-automated algorithm that was manually edited across 28 path/rows and five different years (1988,1993, 1998, 2003, 2008). Three datasets were independently developed by three analysts and the datasets were integrated on a pixel by pixel basis in which at least one to all three analysts were required to agree a pixel was burned. We found that errors within our Landsat reference dataset could be minimized by using the rendition of the dataset in which pixels were mapped as burned if at least two of the three analysts agreed. BAECV errors of omission and commission for the detection of burned pixels averaged 42% and 33%, respectively for CONUS across all five validation years. Errors of omission and commission were lowest across the western CONUS, for example in the shrub and scrublands of the Arid West (31% and 24%, respectively), and highest in the grasslands and agricultural lands of the Great Plains in central CONUS (62% and 57%, respectively). The BAECV product detected most (>65%) fire events >10 ha across the western CONUS (Arid and Mountain West ecoregions). Our approach and results demonstrate that a thorough validation of Landsat science products can be completed with independent Landsat-derived reference data, but could be strengthened by the use of complementary sources of high-resolution data.

AB Melting snow provides an essential source of water in many regions of the world and can also contribute to devastating, wide-scale flooding. Global datasets of recorded passive microwave emissions provide non-destructive, daily information on snow processes including the presence of liquid water in the snow, which can be an indicator of snowmelt The objective of this research is to test the sensitivity of the emission signal as it relates to the spatial distribution of liquid water content in the snowpack. This signal response was evaluated over an area approximately the size of a microwave pixel to assess whether a relationship exists between the aerial extent of wet snow and the magnitude of the T-B response. A sensitivity analysis was performed using a high-resolution, physically based snow-emission model to simulate microwave emissions. The signal response to wet snow was evaluated given a range of spatially distributed snowpack conditions. Daily snow states were simulated for a 9-year period using a high-resolution (50 m) energy balance snow model over a 34 x 34 km domain. These data were fed into a microwave emission model to simulate brightness temperatures. A near-linear relationship was found between the T-B signal response over a spatially heterogeneous snowpack and the percent area with liquid water content (LWC) present. The results were confirmed by evaluating actual wet snow events over a 9-year period. The model output was also compared to AMSR-E passive microwave satellite data and discharge data at a basin outlet within the study area. The results are used to help understand the impact of spatially distributed snowmelt as detected by passive microwave data. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Dryland degradation is an issue of international significance as dryland regions play a substantial role in global food production. Remotely sensed data provide the only long term, large scale record of changes within dryland ecosystems. The Residual Trend, or RESTREND, method is applied to satellite observations to detect dryland degradation. Whilst effective inmost cases, it has been shown that the RESTREND method can fail to identify degraded pixels if the relationship between vegetation and precipitation has broken-down as a result of severe or rapid degradation. This paper presents an extended version of the RESTREND methodology that incorporates the Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend method to identify step changes in the time series that are related to significant structural changes in the ecosystem, e.g. land use changes. When applied to Australia, this new methodology, termed Time Series Segmentation and Residual Trend analysis (TSS-RESTREND), was able to detect degradation in 5.25% of pixels compared to only 2.0% for RESTREND alone. This modified methodology was then assessed in two regions with known histories of degradation where it was found to accurately capture both the timing and directionality of ecosystem change.

AB With over two decades of historical observations, DMSP/OLS nighttime lights (NTL) are an invaluable asset for monitoring, characterizing, and understanding human activity. Due to the lack of on-board calibration, there are systematic biases in NTL data. Consequently, a key deterrent to the use of the entire NTL archive is the difficulty in generating a consistent NTL time series. Currently, there are a number of methods to calibrate Nu. data in order to generate a consistent time series. However, there is no systematic evaluation of the performances of these calibration efforts. The purpose of this paper is to compare and evaluate existing calibration methods and to provide guidance to NTL end users on their relative strengths and weaknesses. We apply two widely adopted criteria to assess the performance of the methods: a) systematic bias minimization, and b) relation with ancillary socio-economic data on economic activity and electricity consumption. Our results show that global-scale calibration methods outperform regionally-based calibration methods. Furthermore, inconsistencies, in the form of differences in pixel values from two satellites of the same region and year, continue to exist in NTL data even after the calibration methods are applied, both across regions and across scales. We find that dimly lit regions are more difficult to calibrate compared to brightly lit regions and that inconsistencies persist in higher northern and lower southern latitudes. We conclude that significant improvements in calibration results will require a shift either towards absolute correction methods using in-situ data or relative calibration methods using NTL from VIIRS.

AB This paper evaluates the performance of different soil moisture products from AMSR2 and SMOS against the most representative stations within the Yanco study area in the Murrumbidgee catchment, in southeast Australia. AMSR2 Level 3 (L3) soil moisture products retrieved from two versions of brightness temperatures using the Japanese Aerospace eXploration Agency (JAXA) and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm were included. For the LPRM algorithm, two different parameterization methods were applied. Furthermore, two versions of SMOS L3 soil moisture product were assessed. The results are contrasted against the use of "random" stations. Accounting for all versions, frequencies and overpasses, the latest versions of the JAXA UX2) and LPRM (LP3) products were found to surpass the earlier versions (JX1, LP1 and LP2). Soil moisture retrieval based on the latter version of brightness temperature and parameterization scheme improved when C-band observations were used but not X-band. However, X-band retrievals (r: 0.71, MAE: 0.07, RMSD: 0.08 m3/m3) were found to perform better than C-band (r: 0.68-0.70, MAE: 0.070.09 m(3)/m(3), RMSD: 0.09-0.10 m(3)/m(3)). Moreover, an intercomparison between different acquisition times (morning and evening) of AMSR2 X-band products found a better performance from evening overpasses (1:30 pm; r: 0.69-0.77) as opposed to morning overpasses (1:30 am; r: 0.47-0.66). In the case of SMOS, morning (6:00 am; r: 0.77) retrievals were found to be superior over evening (6:00 pm; r: 0.69) retrievals. Overall, both versions of JAXA products, the second and third versions of LPRM X-band products, and two versions of SMOS products were found to meet the mean average error (MAE) goal accuracy of the AMSR2 mission (MAE < 0.08 m(3)/m(3)) but none of the products achieved the SMOS goal of RMSD < 0.04 m(3)/m(3). Furthermore, performance of the products differed depending on the statistic used to evaluate them. Consequently, considering the results in this study, JX2 products are recommended if both absolute and temporal accuracy of the soil moisture product is of importance, whereas LP3(x) products from evening observations and SMOS version 3.00 (SMOS2) products from morning overpasses are recommended if temporal accuracy is of greater importance.

AB Recent applications of passive microwave remote sensing techniques to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) increasingly rely on the comprehension of microwave emission theories, instead of traditional empirical fitting approaches. In this study, an advanced SWE retrieval algorithm based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method was developed. This method samples the posterior multiple-layer snow properties according to the likelihood of the brightness temperature (TB) simulation with the actual TB observations. The Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks with improved Born approximation (MEMLS-IBA) was used as the observation model. Using a globally applicable method to produce prior estimates of snow properties, the retrieval approach is called the Bayesian Algorithm for SWE Estimation with Passive Microwave measurements (BASE-PM), and was applied on 48 snowpits at Sodanlcyla, Finland; Churchill, Canada and Colorado, US. The result shows that the root mean squared (RMS) error of the retrieved SWE is 42.7 mm excluding two outliers, and is 30.8 mm if the outliers as well as six deep snowpits from Colorado are excluded. This accuracy approximately meets the 30-mm requirement of Integrated Global Observing Strategy for shallow snow. The poor performance for the outlier and deep snowpits is explained. Additional experiments using more accurate priors show that SWE retrieval accuracy can be improved with local snowcover knowledge, e.g. if historical snowpit measurements or snow process model simulations are available.

AB This study assesses two approaches to combine observations from active and passive satellite microwave instruments in a soil moisture data assimilation system. In the first approach, labeled 'joint retrieval assimilation', a single soil moisture product is simultaneously retrieved from active and passive microwave observations, and then assimilated into the NASA Catchment land surface model. In the second approach, labeled 'separate retrieval assimilation', separate soil moisture products are retrieved from each of the active and passive microwave observations, before being simultaneously assimilated into the model. In both approaches, a Neural Network (NN) is used to retrieve soil moisture from passive microwave AMSR-E brightness temperatures and/or active microwave ASCAT backscatter observations. A spatially distributed (3D) ensemble Kalman filter is used for the assimilation over the contiguous United States from August 2007 until September 2011. The analysis skill of both assimilation approaches is evaluated against in situ observations from 60 SCAN stations and compared to the model open loop (no assimilation) skill. When averaged across the 60 sites, the skill obtained from both assimilation experiments is very similar. For surface soil moisture, the average correlation and anomaly correlation are 0.69 and 0.58, respectively. These metrics are slightly better than those of the open loop, by 0.05 for the correlation and by 0.03 for the anomaly correlation. The root zone soil moisture estimates from the assimilation were also slightly improved compared to the open loop (by 0.03 for the average correlation and by 0.01 for the average anomaly correlation). Locally, there are differences between the skill values of the two assimilation experiments. These are related to differences in the skill of the assimilated retrieval products and how well these differences are captured by the observation errors specified in the data assimilation.

AB Numerous drought indices have been developed to monitor drought conditions. However, different drought indices have differing characteristics, and are suitable for specific environments. The aim of this study was to compare the occurrence of drought, as detected by remote sensing across the Continental United States (CONUS). We used drought events during 2011 and 2012 to compare various indices developed for the study of drought phenomena. Three in situ drought indices, the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), Z-index and standardized precipitation indices (SPI) with different time scales were used to evaluate drought conditions in different climate divisions. The drought indices compared in this study include the vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), the perpendicular drought index (PDI) and modified PDI (MPDI) derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, the precipitation condition index (PCI) derived from tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) data, and the soil moisture condition index (SMCI) derived from advanced microwave scanning radiometer - earth observing system (AMSR-E). Other synthesized drought indices, which combine indices such as VCI, TCI, SMCI and PCI, were also compared in this study. These included the vegetation health index (VHI), temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), scaled drought condition index (SDCI), the microwave integrated drought index (MIDI), the synthesized drought index (SDI), the optimized meteorological drought index (OMDI), and the optimized vegetation drought index (OVDI). The results include a wide variety of drought conditions based on different drought indices. Meteorological drought indices indicated that more regions were under severe drought than agricultural drought indices did. Drought indices appear to be more similar to standard drought indices than PDI, MPDI and TVDI. The results also indicate that different indices have strengths and weaknesses in different climates across CONUS. SMCI has a good correlation with short-term SPI, and the sensitivity of SMCI is strongly dependent on terrain, as it performs worse in regions with heavy tree cover than in regions with a low density of vegetation. TCI, VCI, PDI and MPDI are more similar to 3-month SPI data, but correlate weakly with station-based indices located in areas of high precipitation, higher soil permeability, large-scale agriculture and forests. PCI is more strongly correlated with short-term drought conditions in almost all climate divisions than other single indices. VCI would be more reliable if there were only red and NIR surface reflectance bands available, while VHI would be a better choice if only NDVI and LST data were available. Condition index-based drought indices (PCI, TCI, VCI, SMCI, VHI, SDCI, SDCI, MIDI, OVDI, OMDI) performed better than other categories of drought indices, and the use of time series analysis may be a contributing factor to this difference in performance.

AB Detection of slow or limited landslide movement within broad areas of forested terrain has long been problematic, particularly for the Cascade landslide complex (Washington) located along the Columbia River Gorge. Although parts of the landslide complex have been found reactivated in recent years, the timing and magnitude of motion have not been systematically monitored or interpreted. Here we apply novel time-series strategies to study the spatial distribution and temporal behavior of the landslide movement between 2007 and 2011 using InSAR images from two overlapping L-band ALOS PALSAR-1 satellite tracks. Our results show that the reactivated part has moved approximately 700 mm downslope during the 4-year observation period, while other parts of the landslide complex have generally remained stable. However, we also detect about 300 mm of seasonal downslope creep in a terrain block upslope of the Cascade landslide complex terrain previously thought to be stable. The temporal oscillation of the seasonal movement can be correlated with precipitation, implying that seasonal movement here is hydrology-driven. The seasonal movement also has a frequency similar to GPS-derived regional ground oscillations due to mass loading by stored rainfall and subsequent rebound but with much smaller magnitude, suggesting different hydrological loading effects. From the time-series amplitude information on terrain upslope of the headscarp, we also re-evaluate the incipient motion related to the 2008 Greenleaf Basin rock avalanche, not previously recognized by traditional SAR/InSAR methods. The approach used in this study can be used to identify active landslides in forested terrain, to track the seasonal movement of landslides, and to identify previously unknown landslide hazards.

AB Advances in phenotyping technology are critical to ensure the genetic improvement of crops meet future global demands for food and fuel. Field-based phenotyping platforms are being evaluated for their ability to deliver the necessary throughput for large scale experiments and to provide an accurate depiction of trait performance in real-world environments. We developed a dual-camera high throughput phenotyping (HTP) platform on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and collected time course multispectral images for large scale soybean [Glycine max (L) Merr.] breeding trials. We used a supervised machine learning model (Random Forest) to measure crop geometric features and obtained high correlations with final yield in breeding populations (r = 0.82). The traditional yield estimation model was significantly improved by incorporating plot row length as covariate (p < 0.01). We developed a binary prediction model from time-course multispectral HTP image data and achieved over 93% accuracy in classifying soybean maturity. This prediction model was validated in an independent breeding trial with a different plot type.

AB Capturing and quantifying the world in three dimensions (x,y,z) using light detection and ranging (lidar) technology drives fundamental advances in the Earth and Ecological Sciences (EES). However, additional lidar dimensions offer the possibility to transcend basic 3-D mapping capabilities, including i) the physical time (t) dimension from repeat lidar acquisition and ii) laser return intensity (LRIK) data dimension based on the brightness of single- or multi-wavelength (lambda) laser returns. The additional dimensions thus add to the x,y, and z dimensions to constitute the five dimensions of lidar (x.y,z, t, lambda n). This broader spectrum of lidar dimensionality has already revealed new insights across multiple EES topics, and will enable a wide range of new research and applications. Here, we review recent advances based on repeat lidar collections and analysis of LRI data to highlight novel applications of lidar remote sensing beyond 3-D. Our review outlines the potential and current challenges of time and LRI information from lidar sensors to expand the scope of research applications and insights across the full range of EES applications.

TI Landsat 8: The plans, the reality, and the legacy
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID INFRARED-SENSOR TIRS; RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN
AB Landsat 8, originally known as the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), is a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) partnership that continues the legacy of continuous moderate resolution observations started in 1972. The conception of LDCM to the reality of Landsat 8 followed an arduous path extending over nearly 13 years, but the successful launch on February 11, 2013 ensures the continuity of the unparalleled Landsat record. The USGS took over mission operations on May 30, 2013 and renamed LCDM to Landsat 8. Access to Landsat 8 data was opened to users worldwide. Three years following launch we evaluate the science and applications impact of Landsat 8. With a mission objective to enable the detection and characterization of global land changes at a scale where differentiation between natural and human-induced causes of change is possible, LDCM promised incremental technical improvements in capabilities needed for Landsat scientific and applications investigations. Results show that with Landsat 8, we are acquiring more data than ever before, the radiometric and geometric quality of data are generally technically superior to data acquired by past Landsat missions, and the new measurements, e.g., the coastal aerosol and cirrus bands, are opening new opportunities. Collectively, these improvements are sparking the growth of science and applications opportunities. Equally important, with Landsat 7 still operational, we have returned to global imaging on an 8-day cycle, a capability that ended when Landsat 5 ceased operational Earth imaging in November 2011. As a result, the Landsat program is on secure footings and planning is underway to extend the record for another 20 or more years. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The screening of sensitive spectral indictors is essential for quantitative diagnosis of ozone (O-3)-induced stress in plants. Four wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars with different degrees of O-3-tolerance were grown under an elevated O-3 concentration (E-O-3) in fully open-air field conditions for two consecutive growth seasons from 2012 to 2013. The aim was to find sensitive hyperspectral indictors for real-time detection of O-3 effects. The results showed that E-O-3 caused a significant decrease in leaf thickness and pigment concentrations, resulting in a change in leaf reflectance. The effects of E-O-3 on both physiological variables and reflectance characteristics were wheat cultivar-specific, with a greater and earlier O-3 effect found in the O-3-sensitive wheat cultivars than in the O-3-tolerant cultivars. Spectral indices that were previously developed to detect leaf biological variables were examined, and highly correlated relations were found between the chlorophyll content and the three spectral parameters ND705, mND(705) and R-550. with Pearson r values of 0.896, 0.892 and -0.872, respectively. When independently determined data from 2013 were used to test the derived equations, the coefficients (R-2) of correlation between the measured and estimated chlorophyll were 0.817 (ND705), 0.833 (mND(705)) and 0.776 (R-550): the root mean square errors (RMSE) were 0.227 (ND705), 0.228 (mND(705)) and 0.254 (R-550) (mg kg(-1)); and the mean relative errors (RE) were 8.7% (ND705), 8.1% (mND(705)) and 9.1% (R-550). Furthermore, O-3-induced changes in the three optical parameters were in accordance with the leaf chlorophyll responses in wheat. Our study suggested that the reflectance indices mND(705), ND705 and R-550, especially the former two spectral indices that contained information from several bands, could help to support the diagnosis and real-time monitoring of O-3 induced damage in wheat. To estimate the wheat yield accurately using the selected spectral indices, the filling stage was found to be the best time for measuring canopy reflectance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI Mitigation of systematic errors in SMOS sea surface salinity
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID VARIABILITY; TEMPERATURE; SATELLITE; PACIFIC; MAXIMUM
AB Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) acquired by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission are subject to systematic errors originating from various non-geophysical contaminations such as land contamination. These systematic errors reach more than 2 pss in some regions close to the land with very strong spatial gradients according to the coast orientation and the across-track position within the satellite swath.
   An empirical method to estimate and correct the time independent systematic errors from resampled quasi L2 SMOS SSS is presented. The method is based on self-consistency hypothesis of long term (July 2010-June 2014) variability of SMOS SSS among SMOS dwell-lines and orbit orientation (ascending and descending). The bias correction is performed by first adjusting SSS relative variations among dwell-lines and orbits orientation and then by determining a mean correction over four years. A reference time series of SSS and the associated relative systematic error for each dwell-line and orbit orientation is estimated using a least square approach. Then, the 4-year mean value of corrected SMOS SSS is adjusted relative to a 4-year mean in situ data climatology.
   Four years of salinity maps mitigated from systematic errors are presented. Independent validation using in situ thermosalinograph SSS from ships of opportunity is presented. The new SMOS bias corrected SSS over the global ocean shows an improvement of 32% of the RMSD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Differentiating between first-year ice (FYI) and multi-year ice (MYI) in C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery during spring-summer melt, when wet snow and melt ponds mask the underlying ice, is difficult. It has been suggested that the use of L-band SAR may alleviate this concern given increased penetration depths at longer wavelengths; however, this has not been thoroughly assessed. Here the separability of FYI and MYI is compared using horizontally polarized (HH) C-band (RADARSAT-2) and L-band (ALOS/PALSAR) ScanSAR images acquired over landfast sea ice in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the spring and summer of 2009. L-band provided enhanced contrast between FYI and MW during early melt onset and during the drainage phase of advanced melt, while C-band was found to provide enhanced contrast when the wet snowpack was transitioning from the pendular regime to the funicular regime. At the time of the pendular-funicular transition, the backscatter signatures of FYI and MYI reversed at both C- and L-band. This behavior is well established at C-band, but has not been reported previously at L-band. The L-band imagery also provided improved definition of floe boundaries and ridges throughout the melt season. Finally, the L-band data had reduced speckle (equivalent number of looks similar to 12), relative to the C-band data (-9 equivalent looks). These results indicate that L-band SAR data acquired during the melt season could be used to enhance operational and scientific sea ice information products that have traditionally been derived from single-frequency C-band SAR data.

AB Knowledge of stormwater river plume dynamics is important for the management of lake water quality because river discharge associated with rainstorms can be a major source of pollutants for lake waters. Total suspended matter (TSM) derived from the discharge of sediment-laden rivers is highly variable over a wide range of time and space scales. In the present study, the first use of remote sensing to monitor the river TSM plume was conducted to investigate the effects of heavy rainfall events on Lake Taihu by the largest inflowing river (Tiaoxi River) based on a calibrated and validated model using daily 250 m MODIS imagery in band 1 (620-670 nm). From 2004 to 2013, 48 MODIS images of 20 heavy rainfall events were obtained, showing that the area of the TSM plume significantly increased in the waters adjacent to the inflowing river, reflecting runoff input. The TSM concentration of the river plume after heavy rainfall was significantly higher than that before rainfall (ANOVA, p < 0.001). A significantly positive correlation between the TSM plume area and the rainfall amount in heavy rainfall events (p < 0.01) was also observed. The heaviest rainfall event, in October 2013, caused a river plume with an area of 302.8 km(2), which lasted for more than 10 days. The significant increase in the frequency and rainfall amount of rainstorms and large rain in the past 50 years (1965-2014) in Lake Taihu under global warming indicated an important role of remote sensing in monitoring the river plume resulting from heavy precipitation. The present study demonstrates that remote sensing tools can be valuable instruments in the detection and tracking of the effect of heavy rainfall events on the distribution and diffusion of the TSM concentration in the lake. The results obtained from the present study are valuable for further hydrological research on the Tiaoxi River, particularly for the immediate assessment of flood impacts on soil erosion of the catchment.

AB An optical class-based approach was adapted and applied to satellite imagery of aquatic color radiometry over Lake Superior. Lake Superior exhibits an optically complex environment whose physical and biogeochemical variability is unknown for much of the year. We characterized optical classes or optical water types (OWTs) from remotely sensed data and determined the temporal and spatial distribution of the OWTs. OWT distributions were interpreted through their inherent optical properties (IOPs) and physical drivers. Five identified OWTs based on spectrally normalized remote sensing reflectance imagery from the MODIS-Aqua mission revealed a gradient between class-specific IOPs for colored dissolved organic matter absorption (a(CDOM)) and particulate backscattering (b(bp)). The clearest OWT displayed widespread prominence over the lake and within and across years, indicating strongly stable physical dynamics including stratification and permanent circulation patterns. The most optically complex OWT (highest a(CDOM) and b(bp)) followed more stochastic dynamics coinciding with localized runoff and mixing events. OWTs with intermediate optical complexity delineated river outflow plumes, upwelling, and annual lake wide turnover events while revealing annual and biannual harmonic patterns. OWTs verified both previously observed and unobserved dynamics in Lake Superior, demonstrating a valuable utility to characterize spatio-temporal, optical, and biogeochemical variability.

AB The capability of L-band radiometry to monitor surface soil moisture (SM) at global scale has been analyzed in numerous studies, mostly in the framework of the ESA SMOS and NASA SMAP missions. To retrieve SM from L-band radiometric observations, two significant effects have to be accounted for, namely soil roughness and vegetation optical depth. In this study, soil roughness effects on retrieved SM values were evaluated using brightness temperatures acquired by the L-band ELBARA-II radiometer, over a vineyard field at the Valencia Anchor Station (VAS) site during the year 2013. Different combinations of the values of the model parameters used to account for soil roughness effects (H-R, Q(R), N-RH and N-RV) in the L-MEB model were evaluated. The L-MEB model (L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere) is the forward radiative transfer model used in the SMOS soil moisture retrieval algorithm. In this model, HR parameterizes the intensity of roughness effects, Q(R) accounts for polarization effects, and N-RH and N-RV parameterize the variations of the soil reflectivity as a function of the observation angle, theta, respectively for both H (Horizontal) and V (Vertical) polarizations. These evaluations were made by comparing in-situ measurements of SM (used here as a reference) against SM retrievals derived from tower-based ELBARA-II brightness temperatures mentioned above. The general retrieval approach consists of the inversion of L-MEB. Two specific configurations were tested: the classical 2-Parameter (2-P) retrieval configuration where SM and T-NAD (vegetation optical depth at nadir) are retrieved, and a 3-Parameter (3-P) configuration, accounting for the additional effects of the vineyard vegetation structure.
   Using the 2-P configuration, it was found that setting N-Rp (p = H or V) equals to 1 provided the best SM estimations in terms of correlation and unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE). The assumption N-RV = N-RH = -1 simplifies the L-MEB retrieval, since the two parameters Two and H-R can then be grouped and retrieved as a single parameter (method here defined as the Simplified Retrieval Method (SRP)). The main advantage of the SRP method is that it is not necessary to calibrate H-R before performing the SM retrievals. Using the 3-P configuration, the results improved, with respect to SM retrievals, in terms of correlation and ubRMSE, as the structural characteristics of the vineyards were better accounted for. However, this method still requires the calibration of H-R, a disadvantage for operational applications. Finally, it was found that the use of in-situ roughness measurements to calibrate the roughness model parameters did not provide significant improvements in the SM retrievals as compared to the SRP method.

AB Houston-Galveston (HG) region in Texas has been subsiding due to the combined effects of groundwater withdrawal, hydrocarbon extraction, salt dome movement, and faulting. This human- and partially nature-induced ground deformation has gradually threatened the stability of urban infrastructure and caused the loss of wetland habitat along the Gulf of Mexico. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques can measure ground motions in high spatial resolution over large coverage. The purpose of this study is to map the spatial and temporal variations in surface deformation around the HG region using a Multi-Temporal InSAR (MTI) technique and to assess the role of fluid withdrawal (groundwater withdrawal and hydrocarbon extraction), salt tectonics, and fault activity in land surface deformation. MTI-derived land surface deformation measurements are then compared to GPS and extensometer observations, geologic and hydrologic data, and information about hydrocarbon extraction to address the causes of the observed deformation. The MTI measurements based on ERS-1/2 datasets have mapped regional subsidence up to 53 mm/yr in the northwestern HG as well as a slight uplift at 20 mm/yr in the southeastern HG from 1993 to 2000. InSAR measurements obtained from Envisat and ALOS data reveal subsidence rate of up to 30 mm/yr over the northwestern HG between 2004 and 2011. Our results indicate that the pattern of ground deformation was nearly concentric around locations of intense groundwater withdrawal and the spatial extent of the subsiding area has been shrinking and migrating toward the northeast after 2000. We have resolved localized ground subsidence cones over hydrocarbon exploration fields, which were likely caused by reservoir compaction. We have differentiated ground surface deformation over salt domes, which was due to ongoing differential movement of individual salt spines. We have identified 5-40 mm/yr differential subsidence across a number of faults in the region. These faults functioned as water barriers disrupting the integrity of ground water flow and aggravating localized surface displacements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB To date, the utility of ecosystem and Earth system models (EESMs) has been limited by poor spatial and temporal representation of critical input parameters. For example, EESMs often rely on leaf-scale or literature-derived estimates for a key determinant of canopy photosynthesis, the maximum velocity of RuBP carboxylation (V-cmax, mu mol m(-2) s(-1)). Our recent work (Ainsworth et al., 2014; Serbin et al., 2012) showed that reflectance spectroscopy could be used to estimate V-cmax at the leaf level. Here, we present evidence that imaging spectroscopy data can be used to simultaneously predict V-cmax and its sensitivity to temperature (E-V) at the canopy scale. In 2013 and 2014, high-altitude Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroscopy (AVIRIS) imagery and contemporaneous ground-based assessments of canopy structure and leaf photosynthesis were acquired across an array of monospecific agroecosystems in central and southern California, USA. A partial least-squares regression (PLSR) modeling approach was employed to characterize the pixel-level variation in canopy V-cmax (at a standardized canopy temperature of 30 degrees C) and E-V, based on visible and shortwave infrared AVIRIS spectra (414-2447 nm). Our approach yielded parsimonious models with strong predictive capability for V-cmax (at 30 degrees C) and E-V (R-2 of withheld data = 0.94 and 0.92, respectively), both of which varied substantially in the field (>= 1.7 fold) across the sampled crop types. The models were applied to additional AVIRIS imagery to generate maps of V-cmax and E-V, as well as their uncertainties, for agricultural landscapes in California. The spatial patterns exhibited in the maps were consistent with our in-situ observations. These findings highlight the considerable promise of airborne and, by implication, space-borne imaging spectroscopy, such as the proposed HyspIRI mission, to map spatial and temporal variation in key drivers of photosynthetic metabolism in terrestrial vegetation.

AB We present a new binary (two-class) supervised non-parametric classification approach that is based on iterative partitioning of multidimensional feature space into variably-sized and nested hyper-cubes (partitions). The proposed method contains elements of active learning and includes classifier to analyst queries. The spectral transition zone between two thematic classes (i.e., where training labels of different classes overlap in feature space) is targeted through iterative training derivation. Three partition categories are defined: pure, indivisible and unlabeled. Pure partitions contain training labels from only one class, indivisible partitions contain training data from different classes, and unlabeled partitions do not contain training data. A minimum spectral tolerance threshold defines the smallest partition volume to avoid over-fitting. In this way the transition zones between class distributions are minimized, thereby maximizing both the spectral volume of pure partitions in the feature space and the number of pure pixels in the classified image. The classification results are displayed to show each classified pixel's partition category (pure, unlabeled and indivisible). Mapping pixels belonging to unlabeled partitions serves as a query from the classifier to the analyst, targeting spectral regions absent of training data. The classification process is repeated until significant improvement of the classification is no longer realized or when no classification errors and unlabeled pixels are left. Variably-sized partitions lead to intensive training data derivation in the spectral transition zones between the target classes. The methodology is demonstrated for surface water and permanent snow and ice classifications using 30 m conterminous United States Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) data time series from 2006 to 2010. The surface water result was compared with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) water body and National Land Cover Database (NLCD) open water classes with an overall agreement greater than 99% and Kappa coefficient greater than 0.9 in both of cases. In addition, the surface water result was compared with a classification generated using the same input data and a standard bagged Classification and Regression Tree (CART) classifier. The nested segmentation and CART-generated products had an overall agreement of 99.9 and Kappa coefficient of 0.99. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Incident solar radiation (R-s) over the Earth's surface is important for studying our climate and environment Global observation networks have been established, but many land surfaces are under-represented. Satellite remote sensing is the only way to estimate R-s at both global and regional scales. Many efforts have been made to evaluate the accuracy of current R-s products generated from satellite observations, but only a limited amount of ground measurements was generally used and the individual satellite products were used for analyzing R-s variability. In this study, four satellite estimates of R-s, including the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment - Surface Radiation Budget (GEWEX-SRB V3.0), the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project - Flux Data (ISCCP-FD), the University of Maryland (UMD)/Shortwave Radiation Budget (SRB) (UMD-SRB V3.33) product, and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) EBAF, were evaluated using comprehensive ground measurements at 1151 sites around the world from the Global Energy Balance Archive (GEBA) and the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). It was found that these satellite estimates of R-s agree better with surface measurements at monthly than at daily time scale and can capture the seasonal variation of R-s very well, but these satellite products overestimated R-s by approximately 10w m(-2). The mean bias and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the monthly mean estimates from these four data sets were 10.2 w m(-2) and 24.8 w m(-2) respectively. The global annual mean values of R-s were 186.7 w m(-2), 185.4 w m(-2), and 188.6 w m(-2) for CERES-EBAF, ISCCP-FD, and GEWEX-SRB V3.0 respectively. The averaged global annual mean R-s value from ground-measured-calibrated three satellite derived R-s products was 180.6 w m(-2), which is smaller than that estimated from individual satellite-derived products. The CERES-EBAF product shows the best accuracy among these four data sets, which indicates that including more accurate cloud information from active instruments can improve the accuracy of R-s. These satellite products show different temporal trends. Both GEWEX-SRB V3.0 and ISCCP-FD showed similar trends at the global scale but with different magnitudes. A significant dimming was found between 1984 and 1991, followed by brightening from 1992 to 2000, and then by a significant dimming over 2001-2007. The CERES-EBAF product showed a brightening trend, but not significantly since 2000. The variability from satellite estimates at pixel level was also analyzed. The results are comparable with previous studies based on observed R-s at the surface for specific regions, although some inconsistencies still exist and the magnitudes of the variations should be further quantified. We also found that clouds contribute more to the long-term variations of R-s derived from satellite observations than aerosols. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Arctic tundra ecosystems are responding to effects of climatic warming via shifts in vegetation composition and increased woody biomass. In this sensitive ecosystem, minor increases in woody plant biomass may induce significant changes in ecosystem structure and function. However, establishing methods for quantifying and potentially scaling woody plant biomass in low-stature biomes is challenging. In this study, we investigated the potential to use terrestrial laser scanning (US) to remotely estimate harvested biomass and leaf area of two dominant low-stature (<1.5 m tall) Arctic shrub species in 0.64 m(2) subplots established in northern Alaskan tundra. We explored two biomass estimation approaches (volumetric surface differencing and voxel counting) applied to point clouds obtained from close-range (2 m) and variable-range (<50 m) terrestrial laser scans. Relationships between harvested biomass and TB metrics were strong for all combinations of approaches, with voxel counting giving a marginally better result than surface differencing for close-range data (R-2 = 0.94 vs 0.92; RMSE = 102 g vs 117 g) and surface differencing proving stronger than voxel counting for variable-range data (R-2 = 0.91 vs 0.82; RMSE = 119 g vs 169 g). Strong relationships between total harvested biomass and total leaf dry mass (R-2 = 0.93; RMSE = 13.4 g), and between leaf dry mass and leaf wet area (R-2 = 0.99; RMSE = 9.01 cm(2)) justify estimation of shrub leaf area from TLS-derived shrub biomass. Our results show that rapidly acquired, repeatable terrestrial laser scans taken at multiple ranges can be processed using simple biomass estimation approaches to yield aboveground biomass and leaf area estimates for low-stature shrubs at fine spatial scales (sub-meter to similar to 50 meters) with the fidelity required to monitor small but ecologically meaningful changes in tundra structure. Further, these data may be employed as ground reference data for broader scale remote sensing data collection, such as airborne LiDAR scanning, that would enable shrub biomass and leaf-area estimates at fine spatial resolution over large spatial extents.

AB Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP) is critical for understanding ecosystem response to climate variability and change. Satellite-based diagnostic models, which use satellite images and/or climate data as input, are widely used to estimate GPP. Many models used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by vegetation canopy (FPAR(canopy)) and GPP. Recently, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) has been increasingly used to estimate the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll (FPAR(chl)) or green leaves (FPAR(green)) and to provide more accurate estimates of GPP in such models as the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), Temperature and Greenness (TG) model, Greenness and Radiation (GR) model, and Vegetation Index (VI) model. Although these EVI-based models perform well under non-drought conditions, their performances under severe droughts are unclear. In this study, we run the four EVI-based models at three AmeriFlux sites (rainfed soybean, irrigated maize, and grassland) during drought and non-drought years to examine their sensitivities to drought. As all the four models use EVI for FPAR estimate, our hypothesis is that their different sensitivities to drought are mainly attributed to the ways they handle light use efficiency CLUE), especially water stress. The predicted GPP from these four models had a good agreement with the GPP estimated from eddy flux tower in non-drought years with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) in the order of 2.17 (VPM), 2.47 (VI), 2.85 (GR) and 3.10 g C m(-2) day(-1) (TG). But their performances differed in drought years, the VPM model performed best, followed by the VI, GR and TG, with the RMSEs of 1.61, 232, 3.16 and 3.90 g C m(-2) day-1 respectively. TG and GR models overestimated seasonal sum of GPP by 20% to 61% in rainfed sites in drought years and also overestimated or underestimated GPP in the irrigated site. This difference in model performance under severe drought is attributed to the fact that the VPM uses satellite-based Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) to address the effect of water stress (deficit) on LUE and GPP, while the other three models do not have such a mechanism. This study suggests that it is essential for these models to consider the effect of water stress on GPP, in addition to using EVI to estimate FPAR, if these models are applied to estimate GPP under drought conditions.

AB Aquatic color radiometry remote sensing of coastal and inland water bodies is of great interest to a wide variety of research, management, and commercial entities as well as the general public. However, most current satellite radiometers were primarily designed for observing the global ocean and not necessarily for observing coastal and inland waters. Therefore, deriving coastal and inland aquatic applications from existing sensors is challenging. We describe the current and desired state of the science and highlight unresolved issues in four fundamental elements of aquatic satellite remote sensing namely, mission capability, in situ observations, algorithm development, and operational capacity. We discuss solutions, future plans, and recommendations that directly affect the science and societal impact of future missions with capability for observing coastal and inland aquatic systems.

AB Timing of plant life cycle events (phenology) and annual plant productivity represent key interactions between the climate system and the biosphere, with implications and feedbacks for climate and ecosystem functions. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system is a dominant source of interannual climate variability in the western United States, with important effects on temperature, precipitation, and drought. In this study, we examine the connection between ENSO and terrestrial vegetation dynamics using MOD17 annual net primary productivity (NPP) and land surface phenology derived from MODIS and AVHRR vegetation indices. Three phenology metrics-start of growing season (SOS), end of growing season (EOS), and length of growing season (LOS)-were estimated separately for El Nino and La Nina years by fitting difference logistic functions to split-sample time series of the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (for the period 2000-2011) and AVHRR-derived 3rd generation GIMMS NDVI (NDVI3g) for two temporal periods (2000-2011 and 1982-2011). El Nino events were associated with a significantly earlier SOS than La Nina events in most regions of the western U.S. ENSO-related differences in timing of the end of growing season were generally smaller and more heterogeneous. ENSO impacts on total length of the growing season tended to be spatially heterogeneous but mostly positive in El Nino years. Relative to La Nina events, El Nino events were generally associated with significantly higher NPP in each ecoregion (with mean differences ranging from 2 to 45 gC m(-2) year(-1)). The correlation between total annual production and the Southern Oscillation Index was highest in mid- to late-winter prior to the growing season, suggesting some predictive power in advance of the growing season. These results suggest that future intensification of the ENSO system could have serious consequences for terrestrial ecosystems in the western U.S., especially in regions where ENSO already has a strong impact on interannual climate variability and vegetation dynamics.

AB One of the central goals of using satellite ocean color remote sensing is to detect and identify different phytoplankton groups (size classes) and describe their variability continuously and synoptically for various applications including marine ecosystem dynamics, carbon and biogeochemical cycles, and related fields in oceanography. Taking the advantage of phytoplankton communities having distinct optical properties, this study presents a new model to explicitly detect and differentiate between three phytoplankton size-classes namely, picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton, and microphytoplankton, based on distinct differences in the optical signatures of these phytoplankton groups in a wide variety of coastal and oceanic waters. The model is based on the assumption that there is a significant relationship between chlorophyll-a concentration, and total as well as the size-fractioned absorption coefficients of phytoplankton. The new model is validated using three different in-situ datasets collected from a wide variety of locations in the global and regional oceans (including turbid coastal and eutrophic waters) and its results are further compared with those of the existing two- and three-component models. The new model performs better than other models in terms of yielding more accurate estimates of the total and size-dependent phytoplankton absorption coefficients across the entire visible wavelengths. Since satellite observation of 'ocean color' as detected by a remote sensor provides an estimate of the chlorophyll-a concentration, commonly used as an index of phytoplankton biomass, the new model is also applied to regional and global images of seasonal climatology over a decade of satellite ocean color observations provided by the MODIS-Aqua sensor. When applied to the MODIS-Aqua images of the Arabian Sea dominated by spatially intense algal blooms, the present model is generally excellent at predicting and describing the spatial distribution of these phytoplankton groups within cyclonic eddies and adjacent regions in the Arabian Sea. Conversely, size-fractioned phytoplankton absorption coefficients derived from global images of seasonal climatology are found to vary depending on the season and ocean basin. These global images imply that when phytoplankton abundance increases, larger size-classes are added incrementally to a background of smaller cells. Further examination of these data showed that picophytoplankton population is generally low, although dominating a major part of the surface ocean during summer and winter. Nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton populations are high in surface waters of the North and South Atlantic, North and South Pacific Oceans, Arabian Sea, and equatorial region, showing an increasing trend in summer and a decreasing trend in winter in each hemisphere. These results suggest that the new model is an important tool which will inspire further research to investigate different phytoplankton size classes and their variability on regional and global scales.

AB This study proposed modifying the conceptual approach that is commonly used to model development of stand attribute estimates using airborne LiDAR data. New models were developed using an area-based approach to predict wood volume, stem volume, aboveground biomass, and basal-area across a wide range of canopy structures, sites and LiDAR characteristics. This new modeling approach does not adopt standard approaches of stepwise regression using a series of height metrics derived from airborne LiDAR. Rather, it used four metrics describing complementary 3D structural aspects of the stand canopy. The first three metrics were related to mean canopy height, height heterogeneity, and horizontal canopy distribution. A fourth metric was calculated as the coefficient of variation of the leaf area density profile. This fourth metric provided information on understory vegetation. The models that were developed with the four structural metrics provided higher estimation accuracy on stand attributes than models using height metrics alone, while also avoiding data over-fitting. Overall, the models provided prediction error levels ranging from 12.4% to 24.2%, depending upon forest type and stand attribute. The more homogeneous coniferous stand provided the highest estimation accuracy. Estimation errors were significantly reduced in mixed forest when separate models were developed for individual stand types (coniferous, mixed and deciduous stands) instead of a general model for all stand types. Model robustness was also evaluated in leaf-off and leaf-on conditions where both conditions provided similar estimation errors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Better spatial information on the global distribution of croplands and pastures is urgently needed. Without reliable cropland-pasture separation it will be impossible to retrieve high-quality information on agricultural expansion or land use intensification, and on related ecosystem service provision. In this context, the savanna biome is critically important, but information on land use and land cover (LULC) is notoriously inaccurate in these areas. This is due to pronounced spatial-temporal dynamics of agricultural land use and spectral similarities between cropland, pasture, and natural savanna vegetation. In this study, we investigated the potential to reliably separate cropland, pasture, natural savanna vegetation, and other relevant land cover classes employing Landsat-derived spectral-temporal variability metrics for a savanna landscape in the Brazilian Cerrado. In order to better understand the surplus value and limitations of spectral-temporal variability metrics for classification purposes, we analyzed four datasets of different temporal depth, using 344 Landsat scenes across four footprints between 2009 and 2012. Our results showed a reliable separation between cropland, pasture, and natural savanna vegetation achieving an adjusted overall accuracy of 93%. A similar accuracy and spatial consistency of LULC classification could not be achieved based on spectral information alone, indicating the high additional value of temporal information for identifying LULC classes in the complex land use systems of savanna landscapes. There is great potential for transferring our approach to other savanna systems which still suffer from inaccurate LULC information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Emissivity and backscattering have different sensitivities to soil and vegetation parameters and provide complementary information on the observed scene. For this reason, the main objective of this study was to investigate the potential of the combined use of active and passive microwave signatures to improve the understanding of emission and scattering mechanisms over land. The discrete scattering model developed by the Tor Vergata University, driven by a single set of input parameters, was used to simulate both emission and backscattering. The model accuracy was assessed by comparing modelled emissivity, multiplied by the effective temperature, with C-band AQUA AMSR-E observations and modelled backscattering coefficient with Metop ASCAT observations. The investigation was carried out using datasets collected over the Maqu area, which is located in the north-eastern part of the Tibetan Plateau and is covered by homogeneous grassland with a thin litter layer. In situ soil moisture measurements and MODIS Terra/Aqua 8-days LAI products served as model inputs, whereas the most sensitive other parameters, such as surface roughness and litter and vegetation parameters, were calibrated to obtain the best match between modelled outputs and both ASCAT and AMSR-E 2009 observations. With the calibrated parameters, measured soil moisture and MODIS LAI as input, the model correctly simulated the temporal variations of ASCAT backscattering coefficient, with R-2 of 0.9 and rinse of 0.5 dB. The results obtained in the passive case strongly depended on the adopted effective temperature. The best thatch with satellite observations was found when the surface temperature was obtained from Ka-band AMSR-E data, leading to R-2 of 0.8 and rinse of 6K for H polarisation data and R-2 of 0.5 and rinse of 6K for v polarisation data.
   The validation carried out using the 2010 data, without any further refinement of the calibrated parameters, showed a slightly worse agreement between modelled and observed signatures.
   The results showed that the combined use of active and passive microwave signatures contributed to an unambiguous interpretation of emission and scattering processes over the study area, it allowed us to impose constraints to non-available inputs of the Tor Vergata model and it led to correct simulations of the satellite signatures. These findings are important to better understand the potential of the synergistic use of radiometer and radar data, like those to be provided by NASA's SMAP. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB A novel algorithm is developed and validated to estimate phycocyanin (PC) pigment concentrations of the most common cyanobaterium, Microcystis aeruginosa, in Taihu Lake (China's third largest freshwater lake) using data from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). First, a PC index (PCI) is defined as remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs, sr(-1)) at 620 nm normalized against a baseline formed linearly between Rrs(560) and Rrs(665). Because PC has a local absorption peak at similar to 620 nm, PCI is shown in both theory and model simulations to exhibit a monotonic functional relationship with PC concentration. Field measurements also support this hypothesis, from which an empirical algorithm is developed to estimate PC concentrations between similar to 1 and 300 mu g/L with unbiased RMS uncertainties of 58%. Radiative transfer simulations further show that such a field-based algorithm can be applied directly to MERIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (Rrc) after adjusting algorithm coefficients. Spectral analyses and image comparisons indicate that such an algorithm is nearly immune to perturbations from thick aerosols, thin clouds, significant sun glint, and extreme water turbidity. Mean usable data coverage increases from <1% to >50% when using Rrc as compared to Rrs processed using standard atmospheric correction algorithms in SeaDAS. The robust algorithm performance and significantly improved data coverage lead to the establishment of a long-term (2002-2012) time-series of PC concentrations in Taihu Lake, which show both seasonal and inter-annual changes. Test of the algorithm over other lakes, including Dianchi Lake (a typical plateau lake of China), suggests that the same band-subtraction approach might be applicable to other inland water bodies, although local bio-optical conditions due to different sediment and phytoplanlcton compositions need to be considered when applying such an empirical approach.

AB In this paper, we conduct multivariate analyses of similarity amongst lidar instruments and canopy models by exploiting the similarities of binned canopy height profiles to community datasets in that we treat profile bins as "species" to calculate distance matrices between sample units. Canopy profiles were derived from lidar data using the MacArthur-Horn transformation and from field data using a model we developed that uses two sets of allometric equations describing crown shape and tree height and a third from raw field data. We conducted a statistical comparison of seven asynchronous relative vegetation profiles (RVP) derived from different methodologies between the years of 2005 and 2012. We compared three airborne lidar datasets, three modeled profiles from field data, and one terrestrial lidar dataset using pairwise Mantel tests, multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) and a permutation-based comparison using a similarity index for within plot comparisons. We used the results of MRPP to determine possible drivers of poor agreement between instruments and models and found a moderate relationship between within-plot variability (observed delta) and estimated above ground biomass (r(2) = 0.273, p < 0.05), which we attribute to poor model performance on low density/low biomass plots. In addition, correlation analysis of height metrics derived from RVPs resulted in weak correlations at low height percentiles and strong correlations at higher percentiles. Overall, we identified general similarity between lidar profiles using MRPP (lidar only A = 0.202, p < 0.001), but poorer agreement between lidar and modeled profiles (all profiles A = 0.076, p < 0.001). We attribute some of these differences to selection of canopy profile models and to approaches used for accounting for canopy occlusion in lidar transformations. In addition, we discuss the possibility of using Mantel tests to estimate temporal scales of vertical structure change in La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Monitoring the mass of herbaceous vegetation during the dry season in semi-arid areas is important for a number of domains in ecology, agronomy, or economy and remote sensing offers relevant spatial coverage and frequency to that end. Existing remote sensing studies dedicated to dry herbaceous vegetation detection are mainly motivated by the assessment of soil tillage intensity and soil residue management, risk of soil erosion, and risk of wildfire linked to the mass of dead fuel. Few studies so far have dealt with monitoring of straw and litter degradation during the dry season over large areas while they are important fodder for livestock sustainability. MODIS band combinations (NBAR collection 5) were tested against a set of field measurements carried out over 20 rangeland sites from 2004 to 2011 in the Sahel. The best empirical linear models were obtained for indices using MODIS bands in the shortwave infrared domain (Band 6 centered at 1.6 mu m, Band 7 centered at 2.1 mu m), in particular with the Soil Tillage Index (STI). STI explained 66% of the variance of dry masses (Mass = 3158(STI - 1.05), r(2) = 0.66, RMSE = 280 kg DM/ha, n = 232) for dry and intermediate season data. A regression is also proposed for year-round data (Mass = 3371(STI - 1.06), r(2) = 0.67, RMSE = 352 kg DM/ha, n = 536). The strong inter-site and inter-annual variabilitieswere well captured and the decay rate was found consistent with grazing intensity and fire occurrence. The results imply that the STI can be applied to monitor the mass of dry tissues in the Sahel and potentially in many semi-arid areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID VALIDATION; FLUCTUATIONS
AB Lake levels are an indicator for the hydrological state of an area. Lake levels are directly and indirectly affected by meteorological variations and are both indicators for and caused by water management. Therefore, it is important to monitor the changes of water levels in lakes. As an alternative to water level gauges, satellite radar altimetry is an established method. The problem of radar altimetry so far is that it only gives reliable lake levels for relatively large lakes. The recent Cryosat mission passes many lakes in the so-called SARIn mode at improved along-track resolution. Still, the accuracy and robustness of standard level 2 is limited due to pollution of the waveform by surrounding land topography. We propose to actively extract the water surface component by a novel retracking method based on cross-correlation of observed level 1b waveforms with a generic simulated waveform. Different scatterers will result in different cross-correlation solutions, but, as the water level is contributing to each consecutive waveform, it can efficiently be extracted by a majority voting scheme. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed retracker, we compared the estimated lake levels with accurate Jason-2 estimates over Lake Nasser in Egypt. The proposed retracking algorithm performs better than the level 2 product, and has a RMS of differences with Jason-2 lake levels of 0.30 m. The remaining differences with Jason-2 data are correlated to the amount of topographic pollution, but also show some remaining surface slope artifact. By using the proposed method, one can optimally profit from Cryosat measurements for lake level measurements. Not only can we retrieve lake levels closer to the shore, but due to its dense ground track spacing (7-8 km at the Equator) it is possible to estimate lake levels over many more lakes than with other altimeters. Cryosat lake level estimates are therefore a promising extension of existing time series as measured by notably Envisat, Jason-1 & 2 and GFO. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB This study first investigates using AISA airborne hyperspectral imagery (2 m spatial resolution) to produce detailed lithologic maps in a subarctic region (Nunavik, Canada) where ultramafic rock units associated with Ni-Cu-(PGE) mineralization are exposed in the presence of lichen coatings. Twenty AISA flight-lines were radiometrically leveled and merged to form a 10 x 20 km mosaic, which then served to generate a simulated spaceborne EnMAP scene (30 m spatial resolution) using the End-to-End Simulation Tool to assess the sensors mapping capabilities. Spatial Spectral Endmember Extraction was used to derivespectral endmembers for the AISA and EnIVIAP data. Image endmembers were compared with spectral measurements of field samples to assess how well key rock types were represented. Results show that the AISA imagery provided a better representation of mafic and ultramafic rock types compared with the EnMAP simulation. Endmembers were then used to map the distribution of geological materials using Iterative Spectral Mixture Analysis. Results indicate the airborne data provided more detailed maps compared with EnMAP simulated data. However, EnMAP data could still discriminate and map broad scale lithological units, specifically mafic and ultramafic rocks. This study demonstrates the feasibility of EnMAP to provide large scale reconnaissance mapping capability of geologic materials over vast subarctic and arctic regions (potentially 30 x 5000 km of imagery per day) using expert knowledge combined with automated spectral analysis methods.

AB Mosaics of tree clumps and openings are characteristic of forests dominated by frequent low- and moderate-severity fires. When restoring these fire-suppressed forests, managers often try to reproduce these structures to increase ecosystem resilience. We examined unburned and burned forest structures for 1937 0.81 ha sample areas in Yosemite National Park, USA. We estimated severity for fires from 1984 to 2010 using the Landsat-derived Relativized differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) and measured openings and canopy clumps in five height strata using airborne LiDAR data. Because our study area lacked concurrent field data, we identified methods to allow structural analysis using LiDAR data alone. We found three spatial structures, canopy-gap, clump-open, and open, that differed in spatial arrangement and proportion of canopy and openings. As fire severity increased, the total area in canopy decreased while the number of clumps increased, creating a patchwork of openings and multistory tree clumps. The presence of openings >0.3 ha, an approximate minimum gap size needed to favor shade-intolerant pine regeneration, increased rapidly with loss of canopy area. The range and variation of structures for a given fire severity were specific to each forest type. Low- to moderate-severity fires best replicated the historic clump-opening patterns that were common in forests with frequent fire regimes. Our results suggest that managers consider the following goals for their forest restoration: 1) reduce total canopy cover by breaking up large contiguous areas into variable-sized tree clumps and scattered large individual trees; 2) create a range of opening sizes and shapes, including similar to 50% of the open area in gaps >0.3 ha; 3) create multistory clumps in addition to single story clumps; 4) retain historic densities of large trees; and 5) vary treatments to include canopy-gap, clump-open, and open mosaics across project areas to mimic the range of patterns found for each forest type in our study.

AB Accurate characterization of variability and trends in forest biomass at local to national scales is required for accounting of global carbon sources and sinks and monitoring their dynamics. Here we present a new remote sensing based approach for estimating live forest aboveground biomass (AGB) based on a simple parametric model that combines high-resolution estimates of leaf area index (LAI) from the Landsat Thematic Mapper sensor and canopy maximum height from the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) sensor onboard ICESat, the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite. We tested our approach with a preliminary uncertainty assessment over the forested areas of California spanning a broad range of climatic and land-use conditions and find our AGB estimates to be comparable to estimates of AGB from inventory records and other available satellite-estimated AGB maps at aggregated scales. Our study offers a high-resolution approach to map forest aboveground biomass at regional-to-continental scales and assess sources of uncertainties in the estimates.

AB Vegetation carbon uptake and respiration constitute the largest carbon cycle of the planet with an annual turnover in the order of 120 GT. Currently, neither ecosystem carbon uptake (through photosynthesis) nor ecosystem carbon release (through respiration) can be measured directly during the daytime. Instead, flux-tower measurements rely on nighttime respiration based on the assumption of zero carbon uptake which are then projected to daytime using an exponential relationship to soil temperature at shallow soil depth. As an alternative to this approach, R could possibly also be determined from combining daytime eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem production (NEP) and spectral observations of gross primary production (GPP). In previous work, we have shown that multi-angular observations can be used to determine GPP from the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and spectrally obtained observations of light-use efficiency (epsilon). The difference of NEP and GPP suggests that daytime respiration is greater and more dynamic than conventional estimates derived from nighttime flux values. Our findings also suggest that an accelerated ecosystem metabolism results in an exponential increase in respiration which eventually diminishes net ecosystem production. Respiration was also closely related to air and soil temperature. We conclude that tower-level spectral measurements provide considerable new insights into ecosystem fluxes as they allow independent yet complementary measurements of different aspects of the carbon and energy cycle.

AB A project to map national land use/cover in China was initialized in the latter half of the 1990s. A national land use/cover database of China (NLUD-C, hereafter) at 1:100000 scale that contains Chinese land use/cover data of five periods (1980s, 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2008) was developed during the project. To elucidate long-period sequence land use/cover data for land use/cover change driving factor analysis and ecological environment change research, this database was updated in 2010. Because the NLUD-C focuses more on the thematic and location precisions of land use/cover change dynamics, remote sensing images with approximately 30 m spatial resolution, visual interpretation, field survey and large amounts of auxiliary information were applied during the update process. The results reveal that the change of land use/cover is more complex with 35 change forms among the first-level types and 480 change forms among second-level types between 2008 and 2010. The amount of land use/cover change patches reaches 108,006, and the dynamic area is 40,083.68 km(2). In addition, the NLUD-C accuracy for the selected polygons is more than 96.67%, and the accuracy of the selected firstlevel types is more than 95.41%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB global oceanic and coastal waters, a multilayer back propagation neural network (MBPNN) is developed to retrieve the diffuse attenuation coefficient for the downwelling spectral irradiance at the wavelength 490 nm (K-d(490)). The applicability of Lee's quasi-analytical algorithm-based semi-analytical model, Wang's switching model, Chen's semi-analytical model, jamet's neural network model, and the MBPNN model is evaluated using the NASA bio-optical marine algorithm dataset (NOMAD) and the Eastern China Seas dataset. Based on the comparison of Kd(490) predicted by these five models, with field measurements taken in global oceanic and coastal waters, it is found that the MBPNN model provides a stronger performance than the Lee, Wang, Chen, and Jamet's models. The atmospheric effects on the MODIS data are eliminated using near-infrared band-based and shortwave infrared band-based combined models, and the K-d(490) is quantified from the MODIS data after atmospheric correction using the MBPNN model. The study results indicate that the MBPNN model produces similar to 28% uncertainty in estimating K-d(490) from the MODIS data. Finally, an exemplification of the applicability of the model to the coastal regions in the Eastern China Seas is carried out. Our results suggest that the K-d(490) shows a large variation in the Eastern China Seas, ranging from 0.02 to 4.0 m(-1), with an average value of -0.17 m(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB The fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the photosynthesizing tissue in a canopy (fAPAR) is a key variable in the assessment of vegetation productivity. It also plays tremendous role in accurate retrieval of light use efficiency, which is essential for assessing vegetation health status. The main goal of this work was to study in detail relationships of fAPAR absorbed by photosynthetically active vegetation (fAPAR(green)) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for two crops with contrasting leaf structures (C3 vs. C4) and canopy architectures, using close range (6 m above the canopy) radiometric data and daily MODIS data taken during eight growing seasons over three irrigated and rainfed maize and soybean sites. Our specific goal was to understand differences in fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationship when crop canopy was almost vertically homogeneous (with respect to leaf area and leaf chlorophyll content), as in vegetative stage, and vertically heterogeneous as in reproduction stage. Firstly, we established fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationships for NDVI, taken at close range, and assessed noise equivalent of fAPAR(green) estimation by NDVI, and then we established relationships for NDVI retrieved from daily MODIS 250 m data. Daily MODIS data illuminated fine details of this relationship and detected effects of canopy heterogeneity on fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationship. In vegetative stage, the fAPAR/NDVI relationships for contrasting in leaf structures and canopy architectures crops were almost linear allowing accurate estimation of fAPAR(green) as it is below 0.7. However, very different fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationships in reproductive stages for both crops were observed, showing that canopy architecture and leaf structure greatly affect the relationship as leaf chlorophyll content changes and vertical distribution of chlorophyll content and green LAI inside the canopy becomes heterogeneous. We have found fine details of the fAPAR(green)/NDVI relationships with two types of hysteresis that prevent the use of a single relationship for fAPAR(green) estimation by NDVI over the whole growing season and suggested mechanisms for each type of hysteresis that should be further studied using radiative transfer models.

AB Dynamic variations in coastal water turbidity are key to understanding the sedimentary processes on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula, which has vast tidal flats and a sedimentary environment affected by semi-diurnal tides. The aim of this study is to investigate temporal variations in total suspended matter (TSM) distribution along a coastal region using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), the world's first geostationary ocean color observation satellite. TSM concentrations and water-leaving reflectance measured on the coastal water surface in southern Gyeonggi Bay were used to develop an empirical TSM algorithm. TSM maps were generated from the GOCI images at hourly intervals to examine temporal variations in TSM concentrations. Validation of the maps (via comparisons with in situ measurements) showed that the empirical TSM algorithm had been effectively employed. A comparison with the MODIS-derived TSM concentration also supported the reliability of the maps. GOCI-derived TSM at 1-h intervals successfully represented hourly variations in TSM according to the tidal status. In conclusion, the temporal dynamics of sediment movement with the tidal cycle can be effectively estimated on the west coast of the Korean Peninsula using GOCI.

AB Landsat 8, a NASA and USGS collaboration, acquires global moderate-resolution measurements of the Earth's terrestrial and polar regions in the visible, near-infrared, short wave, and thermal infrared. Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40 year Landsat record and has enhanced capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived 'higher-lever Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies. The paper concludes with future prospects, emphasizing the opportunities for land imaging constellations by combining Landsat data with data collected from other international sensing systems, and consideration of successor Landsat mission requirements.

AB Over the last few decades, increasing rates of change in the structure and function of ecosystems have been brought about by human modification of land cover, of which a major component is vegetation. Metrics derived from linear regression models applied to high temporal resolution satellite data are commonly used to estimate rates of vegetation change. This approach implicitly assumes that vegetation changes gradually and linearly, which may not always be the case. In order to account for non-linear change in annual observations of vegetation from satellites, we test and apply a polynomial fitting-based scheme to annual GIMMS (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies)-NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) observations for North Africa (including the Sahel) for the period 1982-2006. The scheme divides vegetation change into cubic, quadratic, linear, and "concealed" trend behaviors, the latter indicating that while no net change in vegetation amount has occurred over the period, the curve exhibits at least one minimum or/and maximum indicating that the vegetation has undergone change during the elapsed time period. Our results show that just over half the study area (51.9%) exhibit trends that are statistically significant, with a dominance of positive linear trends (22.2%) that are distributed in an east-west band across the Sahel, thus confirming previous studies. Non-linear trends occur much less frequently and are more widely scattered. Nevertheless, they tend to duster within or on the outskirts of zones of linear trend, underscoring their importance for detecting anomalous change features. We also show that the ratio of linear vs. non-linear trends tends to be associated with different land cover types/land cover change estimates, many of which reflect biome-level controls on vegetation dynamics. However, more local drivers related to direct human impact, such as urbanization, cannot be ruled out. Our change detection approach retains the more complex signatures embedded in long-term time series by preserving details about change rates, therefore allowing for a more subtle interpretation of change trajectories on a case-by-case basis. The fitting method is entirely automated and does not require the judicious selection of thresholds. However, while polynomials can give a better fit, they like linear models are based on assumptions, and may sometimes lead to oversimplification or miss short-term variations. Our method can help to contribute more accurate information to one of the major goals of the burgeoning field of land change science, namely to observe and monitor land changes underway throughout the world.

AB Diffuse attenuation of solar light (K-d, m(-1)) determines the percentage of light penetrating the water column and available for benthic organisms. Therefore, K-d can be used as an index of water quality for coastal ecosystems that are dependent on photosynthesis, such as the coral reef environments of the Florida Reef Tract. Ultraviolet (UV) light reaching corals can lead to reductions in photosynthetic capacity as well as DNA damage. Unfortunately, field measurements of K-d(UV) lack sufficient spatial and temporal coverage to derive statistically meaningful patterns, and it has been notoriously difficult to derive K-d in optically shallow waters from remote sensing due to bottom contamination. Here we describe an approach to derive K-d(UV) in optically shallow waters of the Florida Keys using variations in the spectral shape of MODIS-derived surface reflectance. The approach used a principal component analysis and stepwise multiple regression to parsimoniously select modes of variance in MODIS-derived reflectance data that best explained variance in concurrent in situ K-d(UV) measurements. The resulting models for K-d(UV) retrievals in waters 1-30 m deep showed strong positive relationships between derived and measured parameters [e.g., for K-d(305) ranging from 0.28 to 3.27 m(-1); N = 29; R-2 = 0.94]. The predictive capabilities of these models were further tested, also showing acceptable performance [for K-d(305), R2 = 0.92; bias = -0.02 m(-1); URMS = 23%]. The same approach worked reasonably well in deriving the absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in UV wavelengths [a(g)(UV), m(-1)], as K-d(UV) is dominated by ag(UV). Application of the approach to MODIS data showed different spatial and temporal K-d(305) patterns than the K-d(488) patterns derived from a recently validated semi-analytical approach, suggesting that different mechanisms are controlling K-d in the UV and in the visible. Given the importance of water clarity and light availability to shallow-water flora and fauna, the new K-d(UV) and ag(UV) data products provide unprecedented information for assessing and monitoring of coral reef health, and could further assist ongoing regional protection efforts.

AB The Patagonian Ice Fields are known to have undergone rapid retreat of frontal positions and significant thinning of its glaciers over the past decades. However, surface velocities have been measured at only a few of these glaciers. Thus, it remains uncertain if and to what extent the glacier dynamics has changed over time and contributed to ice loss in these ice fields. In this study, we examine the temporal evolution of flow velocities and ice-front positions at eight major glaciers in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field (SPI; Hielo Patagonico Sur) by using Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) images from the Environmental Satellite (Envisat) launched in 2002 by the European Space Agency and Advanced Land Observation Satellite/Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR) data recorded from 2002 to 2011. The examined eight glaciers include Glaciar Jorge Montt, Occidental, Pio XI (or Briiggen), O'Higgins, Viedma, Upsala, Perito Moreno, and Grey. Not all the glaciers revealed significant changes in frontal positions and flow velocities in the study period. We detected significant temporal velocity changes at Glaciar Upsala, Jorge Montt, Occidental, and Pio XI. Among these four glaciers, Glaciars Upsala, Jorge Montt, and Occidental revealed significant acceleration and terminus retreat and were undergoing dynamic-thinning. The markedly different absolute velocities but equally large longitudinal near-terminus stretching at the three glaciers support a calving model based on crevasse-depth criteria, which predict a calving position where crevasse-depths are equal to ice thickness; crevasse-depths are controlled by the longitudinal stretching rate. Meanwhile, Glaciar Pio XI revealed complex spatial and temporal evolution in surface velocities without significant retreat, and its dynamics remains enigmatic. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

ID ENSEMBLE KALMAN FILTER; GRAIN-YIELD; MANAGEMENT
AB To improve the prediction of crop yields at an aggregate scale, we developed a data assimilation-crop modeling framework that incorporates remotely sensed soil moisture and leaf area index (LAI) into a crop model using sequential data assimilation. The core of the framework is an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) used to control crop model runs, assimilate remote sensing (RS) data and update model state variables. We modified the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer - Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM)-Maize model (Jones et al., 2003) to be able to stop and start simulations at any given time in the growing season, such that the EnKF can update model state variables as RS data become available. The data assimilation-crop modeling framework was evaluated against 2003-2009 maize yields in Story County, Iowa, USA, assimilating AMSR-E soil moisture and MODIS-LAI data independently and simultaneously. Assimilating LAI or soil moisture independently slightly improved the correlation of observed and simulated yields (R = 0.51 and 0.50) compared to no data assimilation (open-loop; R = 0.47) but prediction errors improved with reductions in MBE and RMSE by 0.5 and 0.5 Mg ha(-1) respectively for LAI assimilation while these were reduced by 1.8 and 1.1 Mg ha(-1) for soil moisture assimilation. Yield correlation improved more when both soil moisture and LAI were assimilated (R = 0.65) suggesting a cause-effect interaction between soil moisture and LAI, prediction errors (MBE and RMSE) were also reduced by 1.7 and 1.8 Mg ha(-1) with respect to open-loop simulations. Results suggest that assimilation of LAI independently might be preferable when conditions are extremely wet while assimilation of soil moisture + LAI might be more suitable when conditions are more nominal. AMSR-E soil moisture tends to be more biased under the presence of high vegetation (i.e., when crops are fully developed) and that updating rootzone soil moisture by near-surface soil moisture assimilation under very wet conditions could increase the modeled percolation causing excessive nitrogen (N) leaching hence reducing crop yields even with water stress reduced at a minimum due to soil moisture assimilation. However, applying the data assimilation-crop modeling framework strategically by considering a-priori information on climate condition expected during the growing season may improve yield prediction performance substantially, in our case with higher correlation (R = 0.80) and more reductions in MBE and RMSE (2.5 and 3.3 Mg ha(-1)) compared to when there is no data assimilation. Scaling AMSR-E soil moisture to the climatology of the model did not improve our data assimilation results because the model is also biased. Better soil moisture products e.g., from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, may solve the soil moisture data issue in the near future. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Although lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) might be important in water and nutrient budgets, it has often been neglected due to the required effort to measure LGD and due to intense spatial heterogeneity of LGD limiting the validity of measurements. Therefore, fast, easy applicable methods for a first snapshot of the LGD pattern are required and might be the basis for choosing relevant and representative sampling sites. In the present case study, which is actually the first application of an airborne measurement of thermal infrared radiation (TIR) to identify LGD pattern for entire deep freshwater lakes, the measurement was substantiated with thermal profiles in sediments and a water-table map. We found that measurement of TIR is a powerful tool to identify LGD pattern in lake-related studies provided that there is a lack of warm surface inflows. A TIR image taken in March 2012 shows that warm groundwater entering the relatively colder lake water in some near-shore areas is visible as a plume floating on top of the lake water. Prerequisites for the application of TIR to detect LGD pattern are the positive buoyancy of the groundwater relative to lake water and weak mixing in the water column. We propose a dimensionless scale for identifying groundwater floating conditions based on weather conditions. Attributing a surface thermal anomaly to LGD depends on careful consideration of other factors that could produce similar patterns and careful consideration of lake physics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB This work aims at the improvement of the reflectance model-based methodology for mapping of fractional snow cover (FSC) in seasonally snow covered areas in the Northern Hemisphere. The investigations are focused to the determination and analyses of snow-free ground reflectance (rho(ground)). The objective is to derive information on typical average snow-free ground reflectance for predominant non-forested land cover classes in Eurasia and to investigate the implications of their variations to the FSC estimation accuracy. The snow-free ground reflectances are derived from MODIS time series, using single band reflectances and their related indices. Our approach for the determination of rho(ground) is based on the assumption that the behavior of ground reflectance in conditions occurring directly after the snow melt adequately represents the snow-free ground reflectance during snow ablation i.e. melting snow cover including snow-free patches. Additionally, the effects of the rho(ground) variability to snow mapping accuracy for different land cover types are analyzed focusing to the SCAmod algorithm. The current operational implementations of SCAmod use a fixed value for snow-free ground reflectance at the visible wavelengths around 555 nm (corresponding to Terra/MODIS band 4). The deviation between the true snow-free ground value and the fixed value causes error in FSC estimation and, thus, it is necessary to investigate the magnitude and variations of the true rho(ground) for different land covers. Even so, our investigation for the target area of Europe, shows that the currently used fixed value of rho(ground) (10.0%-units) in SCAmod seems to work adequately for land cover classes investigated here. For example, the obtained rho(ground) mean and standard deviation 10.0 +/- 1.3%-units for the agricultural areas and steppe at 555 nm seem to widely coincide with the fixed value. According to SCAmod, the error in FSC estimation caused by the deviation between the fixed and the land cover class-specific value of rho(ground) for agricultural areas and steppe yields a systematic error close to zero and a random error ranging from 2.5 to 1.5%-units with the corresponding FSC range of 0-50%. However, in the case of wetlands (7.4 +/- 0.8%-units), the systematic error caused to FSC estimation using the fixed value compared to using the estimated class-specific value is as large as from 5 to 2.5%-units with the FSC range of 0-50%. For FSC retrievals larger than 50% the error caused by the variability in rho(ground) is considerably smaller for all of the studied land cover classes.
   Our results show that the performance of SCAmod improves if land cover-specific rho(ground) values are applied at least for wetlands. We also suggest that the global application of SCAmod would benefit from the generation of a rho(ground) map for all land cover types by using the methods-presented in this paper. This post-winter reflectance climatology map can be constructed by calculating and using the class-specific rho(ground) statistics together with suitable land cover information.

AB Spatial variation of available food resources can be difficult to accurately quantify for wide ranging organisms at landscape scales. Lichens with usnic acid, a yellowish pigment, constitute a large portion of caribou winter diet across much of their range. We take a new approach of modeling lichen abundances by capitalizing on unique spectral characteristics of usnic acid lichens. We utilize a recently completed ground reference vegetation data set extending over 12,000 km(2) in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska to model the abundance of usnic lichen and other forage vegetation groups. Spectral signatures were obtained for more than 700 vegetation monitoring plots in Denali from Landsat 7 ETM + imagery. We fit models of the absolute percent cover of vegetation groups corresponding to caribou diet items, with a focus on lichens. We used non-parametric multiplicative regression to capture the non-linear relationships between vegetation cover and spectral and environmental data. Different groupings of lichen cover were tried as response variables in addition to usnic lichens to see if other lichen color groups were more detectable. The best fitting lichen model was for usnic acid lichens, which explained 37% of the variation using only three predictors (elevation, bands 1 and 7). Elevation had a non-linear, double-humped shaped relationship to usnic lichen abundance while bands 1 and 7 were positively correlated with usnic lichen cover. These results support previous spectroradiometric ground measurements that indicated usnic lichens were distinctive at those wavelengths. Other vegetation groups had models that explained between 31% and 51% of the variation in cover. Maps of estimated abundance of usnic lichens and other vegetation groups covering the northern half of Denali were generated using our models. These maps enable the study of the role of food resources as a continuous resource in winter habitat selection by caribou, rather than assuming food as a coarser, categorical or thematic variable assigned to discrete areas of the landscape as has been done in most previous studies.

AB High spatial resolution three-dimensional (3D) measurements of vegetation by remote sensing are advancing ecological research and environmental management However, substantial economic and logistical costs limit this application, especially for observing phenological dynamics in ecosystem structure and spectral traits. Here we demonstrate a new aerial remote sensing system enabling routine and inexpensive aerial 3D measurements of canopy structure and spectral attributes, with properties similar to those of LIDAR, but with RGB (red-green-blue) spectral attributes for each point, enabling high frequency observations within a single growing season. This "Ecosynth" methodology applies photogrammetric "Structure from Motion" computer vision algorithms to large sets of highly overlapping low altitude (<130 m) aerial photographs acquired using off-the-shelf digital cameras mounted on an inexpensive (<USD$4000), lightweight (<2 kg), hobbyist-grade unmanned aerial system (UAS). Ecosynth 3D point clouds with densities of 30-67 points M-2 were produced using commercial computer vision software from digital photographs acquired repeatedly by UAS over three 625 ha (250 m x 250 m) Temperate Deciduous forest sites in Maryland USA. Ecosynth point clouds were georeferenced with a precision of 1.2-4.1 m horizontal radial root mean square error (RMSE) and 0.4-12 m vertical RMSE. Understory digital terrain models (DTMs) and canopy height models (CHMs) were generated from leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds using procedures commonly applied to LIDAR point clouds. At two sites, Ecosynth CHMs were strong predictors of field-measured tree heights (R-2 0.63 to 0.84) and were highly correlated with a LIDAR CHM (R 0.87) acquired 4 days earlier, though Ecosynth-based estimates of aboveground biomass and carbon densities included significant errors (31-36% of field-based estimates). Repeated scanning of a 50 m x 50 m forested area at six different times across a 16 month period revealed ecologically significant dynamics in canopy color at different heights and a structural shift upward in canopy density, as demonstrated by changes in vertical height profiles of point density and relative RGB brightness. Changes in canopy relative greenness were highly correlated (R-2 = 0.87) with MODIS NDVI time series for the same area and vertical differences in canopy color revealed the early green up of the dominant canopy species, Liriodendron tulipifera, strong evidence that Ecosynth time series measurements can capture vegetation structural and spectral phenological dynamics at the spatial scale of individual trees. The ability to observe canopy phenology in 3D at high temporal resolutions represents a breakthrough in forest ecology. Inexpensive user-deployed technologies for multispectral 3D scanning of vegetation at landscape scales (<1 km(2)) heralds a new era of participatory remote sensing by field ecologists, community foresters and the interested public.

AB Estimation of the water storage changes in the lakes of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is essential for an accurate evaluation of climate change in this alpine region and its impact on the surrounding hydrologic environment. Because of the remoteness and poor accessibility of these alpine lakes, and a lack of lake bathymetric data, estimating their mass budget over the TP poses a considerable challenge. However, the integration of optical remote sensing images, satellite altimetry data, and gravimetry data makes it possible to monitor the overall variations in lake water storage in this extensive region. The ICESat/GLAS altimetry data used in this study reveal that most of the lakes in the TP showed a significant upward tendency (0.2-0.6 m/year) in water level between 2003 and 2009, particularly those lakes that are supplied with a large proportion of glacial meltwater. A series of lake area data derived from Landsat MSSaM/ETM + imagery over the past four decades indicate that during the 1970-1990 period most of the lakes experienced severe shrinkage, with only some of those in central and western Tibet undergoing expansion. During the 1990-2011 period, in contrast, the majority of the lakes on the TP displayed a remarkably expansion tendency. The total lake area increased from 35,638.11 km(2) in the early 1970s to 41,938.66 km(2) in 2011. Based on the statistical relationships between the extent of the lake surface area and lake water levels from 2003 to 2009, an empirical model for each of the region's 30 lakes is established to estimate the lake water level from the corresponding area data, thereby reconstructing time series of lake level data for each lake from the 1970s to 2011. Based on time series of lake area and water level data, a time series of lake water volume is also reconstructed. The results show that total lake water storage increased by 92.43 km(3) between the early 1970s and 2011, with lakes with an area larger than 100 km(2) accounting for 77.21% of the total lake water volume budget. Moreover, the GRACE signals confirm a similar spatial pattern in water mass changes, i.e., a significantly positive water mass balance in the north and center of the TP and mass loss in southeastern Tibet and along the Himalayas. The water mass budget (6.81 km(3)/year) derived from satellite gravimetry signals in the Chiangtang Plateau are in good agreement with the estimated rising rate of 6.79 km(3)/year of lake water storage in this region based on the empirical model developed in this study. The mechanism of lake water storage changes is discussed and analyzed with reference to previous studies. (C) 2013 Ersevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Significant progress on quantifying state and trends in vegetation structure in savanna and woodland ecosystems has been made by integrating in situ measurements with lidar datasets. However, large area ground-based monitoring campaigns required for calibration are both costly to maintain, and reduce the generality of results. Estimation of directional gap probability (P-gap) from waveform lidar which is both direct (i.e. physically-based) and minimises or removes requirements for field calibration would be a significant advance for large area sampling. We present a new model for estimating P-gap from small footprint airborne waveform lidar data that accounts for differences in canopy (rho(v)) and ground (rho(g)) reflectivity and compare this new method with published discrete return lidar methods. We use lidar surveys acquired at multiple altitudes using RIEGL LMS-Q680i and RIEGL LMS-Q560 waveform systems over a savanna woodland in the Einasleigh Uplands bioregion of northern Queensland, Australia. The waveform model for P-gap was found to fit observed waveform data in cases where the assumption of constant rho(v) and rho(g) was satisfied. P-gap estimates from the waveform model were shown to be relatively insensitive to variation in sensor altitude. This was in contrast to other methods of estimating P-gap where differences up to similar to 0.15 P-gap have been observed. Comparison of lidar-derived P-gap with ground measurements showed the new waveform model produced estimates corresponding to within 5% P-gap. We suggest the waveform model to retrieve rho(v)/rho(g) and P-gap is a significant advance in retrieval of canopy structure parameters from small footprint lidar, reducing the need for local calibration, and providing direct estimates of P-gap. If the assumptions of relatively stable rho(v)/rho(g) are shown to hold across a greater range of sensor, survey, and canopy structure configurations we suggest this method may have wide practical application for retrieval of P-gap.

AB Blending algorithms model land cover change by using highly resolved spatial data from one sensor and highly resolved temporal data from another. Because the data are not usually observed concurrently, unaccounted spatial and temporal variances cause error in blending algorithms, yet, to date, there has been no definitive assessment of algorithm performance against spatial and temporal variances. Our objectives were to: (i) evaluate the accuracy of two advanced blending algorithms (STARFM and ESTARFM) and two simple benchmarking algorithms in two landscapes with contrasting spatial and temporal variances; and (ii) synthesise the spatial and temporal conditions under which the algorithms performed best. Landsat-like images were simulated on 27 dates in total using the nearest temporal cloud-free Landsat-MODIS pairs to the simulation date, one before and one after. RMSD, bias, and r(2) estimates between simulated and observed Landsat images were calculated, and overall variance of Landsat and MODIS datasets were partitioned into spatial and temporal components. Assessment was performed over the whole study site, and for specific land covers. Results addressing objective (i) were that: ESTARFM did not always produce lower errors than STARFM; STARFM and ESTARFM did not always produce lower errors than simple benchmarking algorithms; and land cover spatial and temporal variances were strongly associated with algorithm performance. Results addressing objective (ii) indicated ESTARFM was superior where/when spatial variance was dominant; and STARFM was superior where/when temporal variance was dominant. We proposed a framework for selecting blending algorithms based on partitioning variance into the spatial and temporal components and suggested that comparing Landsat and MODIS spatial and temporal variances was a practical method to determine if, and when, MODIS could add value for blending.

AB A novel computer graphics-based radiosity model applicable to porous individual thin objects, named RAPID, is developed for fast calculation of multiple scattering and bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) over complex, vegetated scenes. Instead of hundreds of small leaf facets, only a small number of porous thin objects are used to construct a complex tree crown or crop canopy. With gaps inside the object, it can effectively represent a group of small leaves. Each porous object has several properties, including shape, size (R), thickness (H), leaf area index (LAI), leaf angle distribution (LAD) and leaf clumping conditions (C). These properties are used to dynamically create the small leaves at run-time; hence, only view factors between porous objects (not between hundreds of small leaves) need to be calculated and stored. As a result, the model significantly reduces the huge memory requirement and long computation time of view factors for a large, realistic vegetation scene. RAPID is able to simulate arbitrary vegetation canopies in complex landscapes and to calculate BRF within a few minutes, which makes its application possible on different satellite pixel levels. This innovative technique is evaluated by comparing with directional reflectances from other models as well as field measurements. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Observations of vegetation phenology provide valuable information regarding ecosystem responses to climate variability and change. Phenology is also a first-order control on terrestrial carbon and energy budgets, and remotely sensed observations of phenology are often used to parameterize seasonal vegetation dynamics in ecosystem models. Current land surface phenology products are only available at moderate spatial resolution and possess considerable uncertainty. Higher resolution products that resolve finer spatial detail are therefore needed. A need also exists for data sets and methods that link ground-based observations of phenology to moderate resolution land surface phenology products. Data from the Landsat TM and ETM + sensors have the potential to meet these needs, but have been largely unexplored by the phenology research community. In this paper we present a method for characterizing both long-term average and interannual dynamics in the phenology of temperate deciduous broadleaf forest using multi-decadal time series of Landsat TM/ETM + images. Results show that spring and autumn phenological transition dates estimated from Landsat data agree closely with in-situ measurements of phenology collected at the Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, and that Landsat-derived estimates for the start and end of the growing season in Southern New England varied by as much as 4 weeks over the 30-year record of Landsat images. Application of this method over larger scales has the potential to provide valuable information related to landscape-scale patterns and long term dynamics in phenology, and for bridging the gap between in-situ phenological measurements collected at local scales and land surface phenology metrics derived from moderate spatial resolution of instruments such as MODIS and AVHRR.

AB Seasonal glacier velocity changes across the High Arctic, including the Greenland Ice Sheet, have been observed and have attracted significant attention over the past decade. However, it remains uncertain how much short-term variability exists in other polythermal glaciers, particularly those in High Asia. Here we report satellite radar image analyses that reveal diverse glacier surface velocities and their evolution in West Kunlun Shan (WKS), NW Tibet, where little is known about glacier dynamics. On the basis of radar images obtained from 2003 to 2011, we examined 36 glaciers, and classified them into two classes according to their multi-temporal velocity profiles: 25 as normal-flow type (surface velocity reaches maxima around the middle part, and gradually approaches zero toward downstream and upstream), and four as surging type (surface velocities are greater than 150 m/yr, and/or the terminus advance is recognized from the radar images). Seven other glaciers do not fit the former two classes, and reveal stagnant velocity profiles that are nearly zero in the lower part but are similar to those of the normal type in the upper part. Although these glaciers could be just stagnant tongues indicative of receding normal type glaciers, given the temporal evolution at the Zhongfeng Glacier, the stagnant type possibly represents a quiescent phase of the surging type glaciers. While glacier surfaces are mostly clean with limited debris-cover, except near the termini, surge-type glaciers might be common in WKS. The observed short-term velocity changes provide us with evidence for efficient basal slip even at the high-elevation polythermal glaciers. This study demonstrates that frequent radar image acquisitions are helpful to understand short-term velocity changes at remote glaciers in detail. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Population displacement due to armed conflicts, regional crises, or natural disasters often leads to large-scale settlements that impact the local environment. The specific dynamics of such semi-permanent settlements, comprising both the structural changes (to the extent of the camp, and the population density), and their wider impacts on the surroundings, require adaptive monitoring capacities. In areas where livelihoods and food security are highly dependent on natural resources, environmental deterioration can result in violent conflicts over access to, or control of, scarce natural resources, or in renewed migration of the population. Remote sensing, and in particular very high spatial resolution satellite imagery, can help determine the actual population dynamics, together with environmental changes in the surrounding areas. In an ex-post assessment using three time slices (2002, 2004, 2008) we assessed the changing environmental conditions and the resulting implications for human security and ecosystem integrity in the vicinity of a large internally displaced persons (IDP) camp in northern Darfur, Sudan. We used a Weighted Natural Resource Depletion index that integrates selected land use/land cover target classes and their relative importance for human security and/or ecosystem integrity by incorporating weightings assigned by experts to each of these classes. The results showed that the dramatic increase in the camp's population between June 2002 and May 2008 (from approximately 1200 to about 50,000 inhabitants) and areal extent (a growth of similar to 436%) was accompanied by a noticeable decrease in the area covered by single shrubs and small trees (similar to -68%), in the area covered by patches of shrubs and trees (similar to-34%), and in the area covered by grassland (similar to -3%). Moreover, a marked expansion in small-scale farming was observed, especially into fertile wadi soils. Almost 45% of all grid cells (60 m x 60 m) had experienced at least some degree of depletion of natural resources (i.e. woody vegetation, grassland, etc.) between 2002 and 2008. Major depletion was observed in the north-eastern and eastern parts of the camp in particular, while minor depletion occurred over almost all of the study area. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The recent availability of high spatial and temporal resolution (HSTR) remote sensing data (Formosat-2, and future missions of Ven mu s and Sentinel-2) offers new opportunities for crop monitoring. In this context, we investigated the perspective offered by coupling a simple algorithm for yield estimate (SAFY) with the Formosat-2 data to estimate crop production over large areas. With a limited number of input parameters, the SAFY model enables the simulation of time series of green area index (GAI) and dry aboveground biomass (DAM). From 2006 to 2009, 95 Formosat-2 images (8 m, 1 day revisit) were acquired for a 24 x 24 km(2) area southwest of Toulouse, France. This study focused on two summer crops: irrigated maize (Zea mays) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Green area index (GAI) time series were deduced from Formosat-2 NDVI time series and were used to calibrate six major parameters of the SAFY model. Four of those parameters (partition-to-leaf and senescence function parameters) were calibrated per crop type based on the very dense 2006 Formosat-2 data set The retrieved values of these parameters were consistent with the in situ observations and a literature review. Two of the major parameters of the SAFY model (emergence day and effective light-use efficiency) were calibrated per field relative to crop management practices. The estimated effective light-use efficiency values highlighted the distinction between the C4 (maize) and 0 (sunflower) plants, and were linked to the reduction of the photosynthesis rate due to water stress. The model was able to reproduce a large set of GAI temporal shapes, which were related to various phenological behaviours and to crop type. The biomass was well estimated (relative error of 28%), especially considering that biomass measurements were not used for the calibration. The grain yields were also simulated using harvest index coefficients and were compared with grain yield statistics from the French Agricultural Statistics for the department of Haute-Garonne. The inter-annual variation in the simulated grain yields of sunflower was consistent with the reported variation. For maize, significant discrepancies were observed with the reported statistics.

AB Due to their sensitive reaction to changes in climatic conditions, glaciers have been selected as an essential climate variable (ECV). Although a large amount of ice is located in the Himalayas, this region is yet only sparsely represented in global glacier databases. Accordingly, a sound and comprehensive change assessment or determination of water resources was not yet possible. In this study, we present a new glacier inventory for the western Himalayas, compiled from Landsat ETM + scenes acquired between 2000 and 2002, coherence images from ALOS PALSAR image pairs, the SRTM digital elevation model (DEM) and the ASTER Global DEM (GDEM). Several specific challenges for glacier mapping were found in this region and addressed. They are related to debris cover, orographic clouds, locally variable snow conditions, and creeping permafrost features in cold-dry regions. Additional to seven topographic parameters that are obtained from the ASTER GDEM for each glacier, we also determined the relative amount of debris cover on the glacier surface. The inventory contains 11,400 glaciers larger than 0.02 km(2), which cover a total area of 9,310 km(2). Analysis of the inventory data revealed characteristic patterns of mean glacier elevation and relative debris cover amounts that might be related to the governing climatic conditions. The full dataset will be freely available in the GUMS glacier database to foster further analyses and modeling of the glaciers in this region. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission was launched on November 2, 2009. Over the land surfaces, simultaneous retrievals of surface soil moisture (SM) and vegetation characteristics made from the multiangular and dual polarization SMOS observations are now available from Level-2 (L2) products delivered by the European Space Agency (ESA). Therefore, first analyses evaluating the SMOS observations in terms of Brightness Temperatures (TB) and 12 products (SM and vegetation optical depth TAU) can be carried out over several calibration/validation (cal/val) sites selected by ESA over all continents. This study is based on SMOS observations and in situ measurements carried out in 2010 over one of the main SMOS cal/val sites in Europe: the VAS (Valencia Anchor Station) site in the region of Utiel-Requena, close to Valencia, Spain. The main vegetation types in the region are vineyards, orchards and natural Mediterranean vegetation. The SMOS observations were analyzed in conjunction with those carried out by the L-band ELBARA-II radiometer over a vineyard which is considered as representative of the main land use of the VAS site. Time series of TB and retrievals of SM and TAU based on both the SMOS (L2 products) and the ELBARA-II observations were compared and evaluated against in situ measurements. A good agreement was found between the time variations in TB and in the retrieved SM values computed over the site from the SMOS and ELBARA-II observations (the determination coefficient R-2 was > 0.88 for the TB values and R-2 > 0.64 for the retrieved SM values). However, it was found that the SMOS L2 SM products underestimated the SM values retrieved from ELBARA-II by similar to 0.2 m(3)/m(3). It is likely this offset can be partially explained by differences between the observed scenes: while the ELBARA-II footprint includes a single vineyard, the heterogeneous SMOS footprint includes not only a large number of vineyards but also a natural Mediterranean vegetation with persistent leaves overlaying rocky soils. The time variations in TAU retrieved from the ELBARA-II observations were found to be closely related to those of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) vegetation index obtained from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) (R-2 = 0.61) and revealed the vegetation cycle over the year. Conversely, the time variations in the SMOS Level-2 TAU product did not reveal any trends in relation to the vegetation development over the site. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluates the performance of ocean color products derived from measurements of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the satellite Aqua using the standard near-infrared (NIR) and the shortwave infrared (SWIR)-based atmospheric correction algorithms in the Chesapeake Bay. The MODIS-Aqua-derived normalized water-leaving radiances, nL(w)(lambda), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data are compared with in situ radiometric measurements from the NASA SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS) database and Chl-a data from the Chesapeake Bay Water Quality Database. Results show that, using the NIR-SWIR combined ocean color data processing, improved nL(w)(lambda) and Chl-a data products can be produced in the Chesapeake Bay. However, Chl-a data are still overestimated in some Chesapeake Bay regions, in particular, in the upper bay region where waters are strongly influenced by the total suspended sediment (TSS) concentration. Specifically, using the NIR-SWIR approach, mean ratios of MODIS-derived and in situ-measured nL(w)(lambda) at wavelengths of 412, 443, 488, 531, 551, and 667 nm for the Chesapeake Bay are 1.288, 1.093, 0.998, 0.946, 0.908, and 0.865, respectively, while mean Chl-a values over the region from satellite-derived and in situ-measure data are 11.14 and 10.28 mg. m(-3), respectively. Based on a strong correlation relationship between TSS and water diffuse attenuation coefficient, a regional TSS algorithm for the Chesapeake Bay has been developed and validated, with mean ratio of 1.064 between MODIS-derived and in situ-measured TSS data. Therefore, using the NIR-SWIR algorithm for MODIS-Aqua ocean color data processing, nL(w)(lambda), Chl-a, and TSS data from 2002 to 2010 for the Chesapeake Bay have been generated and used for characterizing the water properties in the region, showing strong seasonal and interannual variability, as well as important spatial variations in the region.

AB Thermal inertia over vast earth surfaces is a crucial parameter in many related disciplines. However, remote estimates of urban thermal inertia show anisotropy effects due to thermal anisotropy. This study investigates the impacts of thermal anisotropy on the estimation of urban thermal inertia. We present the concepts of DTI (directional thermal inertia) and DATI (directional apparent thermal inertia) to describe this anisotropic effect. A combined approach to estimating thermal inertia named NLS (nonlinear least square) is proposed as a compromise solution using temporal temperature measurements. Intercomparisons between methods are indirectly conducted by predicting surface temperatures, and the results indicate the NLS has higher accuracy of 1 to 2 K. The DTI estimation over an urban scale model, together with flat concrete and grass surfaces, reveals that the DTI intensity is significant when DRTs (directional radiometric temperatures) are used as inputs. Over the scale model, the DTI and DATI values range from 0.028 to 0.038 K-1 and from 1530 to 2970 W.s(1/2.)m(-2)-K-1 if the zenith and azimuth are between -60 degrees and +60 degrees and between 0 degrees and +360 degrees, respectively. Further discussions demonstrate that DRT intensity has an approximate linear relationship with DTI intensity and that it thus could be used as a predictor of DTI intensity. We finally propose that using complete urban surface temperatures instead of the DRT would be better to estimate urban thermal inertia from the perspective of surface energy balance.

AB Freshwater resources are becoming increasingly limited in many parts of the world, and decision makers are demanding new tools for monitoring water availability and rates of consumption. Remotely sensed thermal-infrared imagery collected by Landsat provides estimates of land-surface temperature that allow mapping of evapotranspiration (ET) at the spatial scales at which water is being used. This paper explores the utility of moderate-resolution thermal satellite imagery in water resource management General modeling techniques for using land-surface temperature in mapping the surface energy balance are described, including methods developed to safeguard Er estimates from expected errors in the remote sensing inputs. Examples are provided of how remotely sensed maps of ET derived from Landsat thermal imagery are being used operationally by water managers today: in monitoring water rights, negotiating interstate compacts, estimating water-use by invasive species, and in determining allocations for agriculture, urban use, and endangered species protection. Other applications include monitoring drought and food insecurity, and evaluation of large-scale land-surface and climate models. To better address user requirements for high-resolution, time-continuous Er data, novel techniques have been developed to improve the spatial resolution of Landsat thermal-band imagery and temporal resolution between Landsat overpasses by fusing information from other wavebands and satellites. Finally, a strategy for future modification to the Landsat program is suggested, improving our ability to track changes in water use due to changing climate and growing population. The long archive of global, moderate resolution TIR imagery collected by the Landsat series is unmatched by any other satellite program, and will continue to be an invaluable asset to better management of our earth's water resources.

AB Landsat's continuing record of the thermal state of the earth's surface represents the only long term (1982 to the present) global record with spatial scales appropriate for human scale studies (i.e., tens of meters). Temperature drives many of the physical and biological processes that impact the global and local environment. As our knowledge of, and interest in, the role of temperature on these processes have grown, the value of Landsat data to monitor trends and process has also grown. The value of the Landsat thermal data archive will continue to grow as we develop more effective ways to study the long term processes and trends affecting the planet. However, in order to take proper advantage of the thermal data, we need to be able to convert the data to surface temperatures. A critical step in this process is to have the entire archive completely and consistently calibrated into absolute radiance so that it can be atmospherically compensated to surface leaving radiance and then to surface radiometric temperature. This paper addresses the methods and procedures that have been used to perform the radiometric calibration of the earliest sizable thermal data set in the archive (Landsat 4 data). The completion of this effort along with the updated calibration of the earlier (1985-1999) Landsat 5 data, also reported here, concludes a comprehensive calibration of the Landsat thermal archive of data from 1982 to the present.

AB The focus of the study was to assess gradual changes occurring throughout a range of natural ecosystems using decadal Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) time series data. Time series data stacks were generated for four study areas: (1) a four scene area dominated by forest and rangeland ecosystems in the southwestern United States, (2) a sagebrush-dominated rangeland in Wyoming, (3) woodland adjacent to prairie in northwestern Nebraska, and (4) a forested area in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Through analyses of time series data, we found evidence of gradual systematic change in many of the natural vegetation communities in all four areas. Many of the conifer forests in the southwestern US are showing declines related to insects and drought, but very few are showing evidence of improving conditions or increased greenness. Sagebrush communities are showing decreases in greenness related to fire, mining, and probably drought, but very few of these communities are showing evidence of increased greenness or improving conditions. In Nebraska, forest communities are showing local expansion and increased canopy densification in the prairie-woodland interface, and in the White Mountains high elevation understory conifers are showing range increases towards lower elevations. The trends detected are not obvious through casual inspection of the Landsat images. Analyses of time series data using many scenes and covering multiple years are required in order to develop better impressions and representations of the changing ecosystem patterns and trends that are occurring. The approach described in this paper demonstrates that Landsat time series data can be used operationally for assessing gradual ecosystem change across large areas. Local knowledge and available ancillary data are required in order to fully understand the nature of these trends. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We propose a normalized difference chlorophyll index (NDCI) to predict chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration from remote sensing data in estuarine and coastal turbid productive (case 2) waters. NDCI calibration and validation results derived from simulated and MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) datasets show its potential application to widely varying water types and geographic regions. A quadratic function (R-2=0.95, p<0.0001) accurately explained the variance in the simulated data for a chl-a range of 1-60 mg m(-3). Similarly a twofold calibration and validation of chl-a models using MERIS dataset, (chl-a range: 0.9-28.1 mg m(-3)) yielded R-2 of 0.9, and RMSE of similar to 2 mg m(-3) respectively. NDCI was applied on images over the Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay, the Mobile Bay, and the Mississippi River delta region in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The newly developed algorithm was successful in predicting chl-a concentration with approximately 12% overall bias for all above study regions. Findings from this research imply that NDCI can be successfully used on MERIS images to quantitatively monitor chl-a in inland coastal and estuarine waters. In case of remote coastal waters with no ground truth data. NDCI can be used to detect algal bloom and qualitatively infer chl-a concentration ranges very similar to NDVI's application in terrestrial vegetation studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB An initial validation of the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) Reprocessing for Climate (ARC) retrievals of sea surface temperature (SST) is presented. ATSR-2 and Advanced ATSR (AATSR) SST estimates are compared to drifting buoy and moored buoy observations over the period 1995 to 2008. The primary ATSR estimates are of skin SST, whereas buoys measure SST below the surface. Adjustment is therefore made for the skin effect, for diurnal stratification and for differences in buoy-satellite observation time. With such adjustments, satellite-in situ differences are consistent between day and night within similar to 0.01 K. Satellite-in situ differences are correlated with differences in observation time, because of the diurnal warming and cooling of the ocean. The data are used to verify the average behaviour of physical and empirical models of the warming/cooling rates.
   Systematic differences between adjusted AATSR and in-situ SSTs against latitude, total column water vapour (TCWV), and wind speed are less than 0.1 K, for all except the most extreme cases (TCWV <5 kg m(-2), TCWV >60 kg m(-2)). For all types of retrieval except the nadir-only two-channel (N2), regional biases are less than 0.1 K for 80% of the ocean. Global comparison against drifting buoys shows night time dual-view two-channel (D2) SSTs are warm by 0.06 +/- 0.23 K and dual-view three-channel (D3) SSTs are warm by 0.06 +/- 0.21 K (day-time 02: 0.07 +/- 0.23 K). Nadir-only results are N2: 0.03 +/- 0.33 K and N3: 0.03 +/- 0.19 K showing the improved inter-algorithm consistency to similar to 0.02 K. This represents a marked improvement from the existing operational retrieval algorithms for which inter-algorithm inconsistency is >0.5 K. Comparison against tropical moored buoys, which are more accurate than drifting buoys, gives lower error estimates (N3: 0.02 +/- 0.13 K, 02: 0.03 +/- 0.18 K). Comparable results are obtained for ATSR-2, except that the ATSR-2 SSTs are around 0.1 K warm compared to AATSR. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Urbanization is taking place at an unprecedented rate around the world, particularly in China in the past few decades. One of the key impacts of rapid urbanization on the environment is the effect of urban heat island (UHI). Understanding the effects of landscape pattern on UHI is crucial for improving the ecology and sustainability of cities. This study investigated how landscape composition and configuration would affect UHI in the Shanghai metropolitan region of China, based on the analysis of land surface temperature (LST) in relation to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation fraction (Fv), and percent impervious surface area (ISA). Two Landsat ETM+ images acquired on March 13 and July 2, 2001 were used to estimate LST. Fv, and percent ISA. Landscape metrics were calculated from a high spatial resolution (2.5 x 2.5 m) land-cover/land-use map. Our results have showed that, although there are significant variations in LST at a given fraction of vegetation or impervious surface on a per-pixel basis, NDVI, Fv, and percent ISA are all good predictors of LST on the regional scale. There is a strong negative linear relationship between LST and positive NDVI over the region. Similar but stronger negative linear relationship exists between LST and Fv. Urban vegetation could mitigate the surface UHI better in summer than in early spring. A strong positive relationship exists between mean LST and percent ISA. The residential land is the biggest contributor to UHL followed by industrial land. Although industrial land has the highest LST, it has limited contribution to the overall surface UHI due to its small spatial extend in Shanghai. Among the residential land-uses, areas with low- to-middle-rise buildings and low vegetation cover have much high temperatures than areas with high-rise buildings or areas with high vegetation cover. A strong correlation between the mean LST and landscape metrics indicates that urban landscape configuration also influences the surface UHI. These findings are helpful for understanding urban ecology as well as land use planning to minimize the potential environmental impacts of urbanization. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) derived diffuse light attenuation along the Louisiana continental shelf (LCS) was examined at monthly scales from 1998 to 2007 to characterize temporal and spatial patterns, and responsible physical forcing conditions. The SeaWiFS diffuse light attenuation ranged from 0.10 to 2.64 m(-1). Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis suggested that spatial and temporal patterns in diffuse light attenuation were influenced by wind speed, nutrient loading, and river discharge from the Mississippi and Atchafalaya River Basin. SeaWiFS daily integrated surface photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) and diffuse light attenuation were used to calculate the absolute PAR and percentage of surface PAR that reached the sediment water interface (SWI) on the LCS. Large portions of the LCS were euphotic to the SWI especially during April and May. This finding implied that significant primary production was possible beneath the pycnocline during spring and early summer. In addition, this study was the first to demonstrate that the euphotic depth was correlated to the depth at which the water column turned hypoxic on the LCS. The development of hypoxic waters may be influenced by decreased light availability below the pycnocline in addition to aforementioned physical forcing. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Satellite L-band synthetic aperture radar backscatter data from 1996 and 2007 (from JERS-1 and ALOS PALSAR respectively), were used with field data collected in 2007 and a back-calibration method to produce biomass maps of a 15 000 km(2) forest-savanna ecotone region of central Cameroon. The relationship between the radar backscatter and aboveground biomass (AGB) was strong (r(2)=0.86 for ALOS HV to biomass plots, r(2)=0.95 relating ALOS-derived biomass for 40 suspected unchanged regions to JERS-1 HH). The root mean square error (RMSE) associated with AGB estimation varied from similar to 25% for AGB<100 Mg ha(-1) to similar to 40% for AGB>100 Mg ha(-1) for the ALOS HV data. Change detection showed a significant loss of AGB over high biomass forests, due to suspected deforestation and degradation, and significant biomass gains along the forest-savanna boundary, particularly in areas of low population density. Analysis of the errors involved showed that radar data can detect changes in broad AGB class in forest-savanna transition areas with an accuracy >95%. However, quantitative assessment of changes in AGB in Mg ha(-1) at a pixel level will require radar images from sensors with similar characteristics collecting data from the same season over multiple years.

AB Forest disturbances such as bark beetle outbreaks are increasing in severity and extent across western North America. Classification of remote sensing imagery is a powerful way to analyze and detect large-scale disturbances. We used a temporal sequence of four Lzndsat TM images (1991, 1995, 1999, and 2003) to detect the spatiotemporal change in spectral response of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex. Engelm.) killed by an unprecedented spruce beetle outbreak in southern Utah, USA. After co-registration and masking out non-vegetation the Disturbance Index (DI) was calculated for each image. DI values associated with Engelmann spruce mortality, determined by comparing each image to a no outbreak baseline image, were then used to classify the images. Dendrochronologically determined dates of spruce death collected from across the outbreak area were used to assess the ability of the DI to accurately differentiate stands of dead spruce from live conifer forest. The overall classification accuracy of the DI varied from 80 to 82% while the accuracy to detect spruce beetle-killed spruce varied from 59 to 71%. Both user's and producer's accuracy to classify beetle infested stands increased over the temporal sequence of image dates. However, confusion matrix-derived statistics varied by image date. Consistent with previous studies, the spruce beetle outbreak began building in multiple, seemingly independent locations across the study area. Over time, areas attacked earlier in the outbreak enlarged and coalesced on the landscape. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is a major pathway for water loss from many ecosystems, and its seasonal variation affects soil moisture and net ecosystem CO2 exchange. We developed an algorithm to estimate ET using a semi-empirical Priestley-Taylor (PT) approach, which can be applied at a range of spatial scales. We estimated regional net radiation (R-net) at monthly time scales using MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo and land surface temperature. Good agreement was found between satellite-based estimates of monthly R-net and field-measured R-net, with a RMSE of less than 30 Wm(-2). An adjustable PT coefficient was parameterized as a function of leaf area index and soil moisture based on observations from 27 AmeriFlux eddy covariance sites. The biome specific optimization using tower-based observations performed well, with a RMSE of 17 Wm(-2) and a correlation of 0.90 for predicted monthly latent heat. We implemented the approach within the hydrology module of the CASA biogeochemical model, and used it to estimate ET at a 1 km spatial resolution for the conterminous United States (CONUS). The RMSE of modeled ET was reduced to 21.1 mm mon(-1), compared to 27.1 mm mon(-1) in the original CASA model. The monthly ET rates averaged over the Mississippi River basin were similar to those derived using GRACE satellite measurements and river discharge data. ET varied substantially over the CONUS, with annual mean values of 110 +/- 76 mm yr(-1) in deserts, 391 +/- 176 mm yr(-1) in savannas and grasslands, and 840 +/- 234 mm yr(-1) in broadleaf forests. The PT coefficient was the main driver for the spatial variation of ET in arid areas, whereas R-net controlled ET when mean annual precipitation was higher than approximately 400 mm yr(-1).

AB Over the past decade, the role of multiangle remote sensing has been central to the development of algorithms for the retrieval of global land surface properties including models of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), albedo, land cover/dynamics, burned area extent, as well as other key surface biophysical quantities impacted by the anisotropic reflectance characteristics of vegetation. In this study, a new retrieval strategy for fine-to-moderate resolution multiangle observations was developed, based on the operational sequence used to retrieve the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 5 reflectance and BRDF/albedo products. The algorithm makes use of a semiempirical kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance model to provide estimates of intrinsic albedo (i.e., directional-hemispherical reflectance and bihemispherical reflectance), model parameters describing the BRDF, and extensive quality assurance information. The new retrieval strategy was applied to NASA's Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) data acquired during the 2007 Cloud and Land Surface Interaction Campaign (CLASIC) over the well-instrumented Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) site in Oklahoma, USA. For the case analyzed, we obtained similar to 1.6 million individual surface bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) retrievals, from nadir to 75 degrees off-nadir, and at spatial resolutions ranging from 3 m to 500 m. This unique dataset was used to examine the interaction of the spatial and angular characteristics of a mixed agricultural landscape; and provided the basis for detailed assessments of: (1) the use of a land cover type-specific a priori knowledge in kernel-driven BRDF model inversions; (2) the interaction between surface reflectance anisotropy and instrument spatial resolution: and (3) the uncertainties that arise when sub-pixel differences in the BRDF are aggregated to a moderate resolution satellite pixel. Results offer empirical evidence concerning the influence of scale and spatial heterogeneity in kernel-driven BRDF models; providing potential new insights into the behavior and characteristics of different surface radiative properties related to land/use cover change and vegetation structure.

AB Remote sensing of forest canopy cover has been widely studied recently, but little attention has been paid to the quality of field validation data. Ecological literature has two different coverage metrics. Vertical canopy cover (VCC) is the vertical projection of tree crowns ignoring within-crown gaps. Angular canopy closure (ACC) is the proportion of covered sky at some angular range around the zenith, and can be measured with a field-of-view instrument, such as a camera. We compared field-measured VCC and ACC at 15 degrees and 75 degrees from the zenith to different LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) metrics, using several LiDAR data sets and comprehensive field data. The VCC was estimated to a high precision using a simple proportion of canopy points in first-return data. Confining to a maximum 15 degrees scan zenith angle, the absolute root mean squared error (RMSE) was 3.7-7.0%, with an overestimation of 3.1-4.6%. We showed that grid-based methods are capable of reducing the inherent overestimation of VCC. The low scan angles and low power settings that are typically applied in topographic LiDARs are not suitable for ACC estimation as they measure in wrong geometry and cannot easily detect small within-crown gaps. However, ACC at 0-15 degrees zenith angles could be estimated from LiDAR data with sufficient precision, using also the last returns (RMSE 8.1-113%, bias -6.1-+4.6%). The dependency of LiDAR metrics and ACC at 0-75 degrees zenith angles was nonlinear and was modeled from laser pulse proportions with nonlinear regression with a best-case standard error of 4.1%. We also estimated leaf area index from the LiDAR metrics with linear regression with a standard error of 0.38. The results show that correlations between airborne laser metrics and different canopy field characteristics are very high if the field measurements are done with equivalent accuracy.

AB Accurate measurement of leaf area index (LAI), an important characteristic of plant canopies directly linked to primary production, is essential for monitoring changes in ecosystem C stocks and other ecosystem level fluxes. Direct measurement of LAI is labor intensive, impractical at large scales and does not capture seasonal or annual variations in canopy biomass. The need to monitor canopy related fluxes across landscapes makes remote sensing an attractive technique for estimating LAI. Many vegetation indices, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), tend to saturate at LAI levels >4 although tropical and temperate forested ecosystems often exceed that threshold. Using two monospecific shrub thickets as model systems, we evaluated the potential of a variety of algorithms specifically developed to improve accuracy of LAI estimates in canopies where LAI exceeds saturation levels for other indices. We also tested the potential of indices developed to detect variations in canopy chlorophyll to estimate LAI because of the direct relationship between total canopy chlorophyll content and LAI. Indices were evaluated based on data from direct (litterfall) and indirect measurements (LAI-2000) of LAI. Relationships between results of direct and indirect ground-sampling techniques were also evaluated. For these two canopies, the indices that showed the highest potential to accurately differentiate LAI values >4 were derivative indices based on red-edge spectral reflectance. Algorithms intended to improve accuracy at high LAI values in agricultural systems were insensitive when LAI exceeded 4 and offered little or no improvement over NDVI. Furthermore, indirect ground-sampling techniques often used to evaluate the potential of vegetation indices also saturate when LAI exceeds 4. Comparisons between hyperspectral vegetation indices and a saturated LAI value from indirect measurement may overestimate accuracy and sensitivity of some vegetation indices in high LAI communities. We recommend verification of indirect measurements of LAI with direct destructive sampling or litterfall collection, particularly in canopies with high LAI. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB The aerosol vertical distribution is an important factor in determining the relationship between satellite retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ground-level fine particle pollution concentrations. We evaluate how aerosol profiles measured by ground-based lidar and simulated by models can help improve the association between AOD retrieved by the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and fine particle sulfate (SO4) concentrations using matched data at two lidar sites. At the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) site, both lidar and model aerosol profiles marginally improve the association between SO4 concentrations and MISR fractional AODs, as the correlation coefficient between cross-validation (CV) and observed SO4 concentrations changes from 0.87 for the no-scaling model to 0.88 for models scaled with aerosol vertical profiles. At the GSFC site, a large amount of urban aerosols resides in the well-mixed boundary layer so the column fractional AODs are already excellent indicators of ground-level particle pollution. In contrast, at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) site with relatively low aerosol loadings, scaling substantially improves model performance. The correlation coefficient between CV and observed SO4 concentrations is increased from 0.58 for the no-scaling model to 0.76 in the GEOS-Chem scaling model, and the model bias is reduced from 17% to 9%. In summary, despite the inaccuracy due to the coarse horizontal resolution and the challenges of simulating turbulent mixing in the boundary layer, GEOS-Chem simulated aerosol profiles can still improve methods for estimating surface aerosol (504) mass from satellite-based AODs, particularly in rural areas where aerosols in the free troposphere and any long-range transport of aerosols can significantly contribute to the column AOD.

AB The absorption feature approach was used in CHRIS multiangular hyperspectral data in order to investigate its potential for ecosystem remote sensing. For that purpose, CHRIS images in mode 1 were acquired throughout a two-year period for a Mediterranean ecosystem dominated by the semi-deciduous shrub Phlomis fruticosa. During each acquisition, coincident in situ Leaf spectra and ecophysiological measurements (Leaf Area Index, leaf pigment content and leaf water potential) were conducted. After data preprocessing, absorption feature information was calculated for both CHRIS and Leaf spectra for the whole spectrum. Three common characteristic absorption features within the spectral areas 450-550 nm, 550-750 nm and 900-1000 nm were detected. Each spectral area was then examined separately and four characteristic parameters were calculated that described the pattern, magnitude and position of the maximum absorption. Correlations between CHRIS and Leaf spectra for each date and viewing angle (VA) were then conducted. All correlations, either on full continuum removed spectra or on spectral areas, showed high coefficients of determination, especially (i) in higher observation angles (VA + 55), (ii) during the wet season and (iii) in strong absorptions such as the "red absorption". Subsequently, correlations between CHRIS and Leaf absorption parameters of selected spectral areas with field-measured ecophysiological parameters were examined. Ecophysiological parameters proved to be highly correlated to CHRIS and Leaf absorption parameters in magnitude and/or pattern of the absorption feature and less in wavelength of the maximum absorption. CHRIS VAs +/- 36 showed the highest correlations although the type of relation, linear or nonlinear, was not conclusive. Finally, a first comparison between narrowband spectral indices and absorption features in correlations with ecophysiological parameters showed that both methods provide significant and comparable results, with oblique angles showing best performance. However, ecophysiological parameters are generally better predicted linearly by narrowband spectral indices issued from CHRIS, with most significant differences appearing on pigments absorbing mainly within 450-550 nm.

AB Water temperature plays an important role in ecological functioning and in controlling the biogeochemical processes of a water body. Conventional water quality monitoring is expensive and time consuming. It is particularly problematic if the water bodies to be examined are large. Conventional techniques also bring about a high probability of undersampling. Conversely, remote sensing is a powerful tool to assess aquatic systems. The objective of this study was to map the surface water temperature and improve understanding of spatiotemporal variations in a hydroelectric reservoir. In this work, MODIS land-surface temperature (LST) level 2, 1-km nominal resolution data (MOD11L2, version 5) were used. All available clear-sky MODIS/Terra images from 2003 to 2008 were used, resulting in a total of 786 daytime and 473 nighttime images. Descriptive statistics (mean, maximum and minimum) were computed for the historical images to build a time series of daytime and nighttime monthly mean temperatures. The thermal amplitude and anomaly were also computed. In-situ meteorological variables were used from 2003 to 2008 to help understand the spatiotemporal variability of the surface water temperature. The surface energy budget and the depth at which the wind can distribute the heat input of a given surface were also measured. A correlation between daytime and nighttime surface water temperatures and the computed heat fluxes were made. These relationships and the causes of the water surface temperature variability are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Maps of coral reef habitats are fundamental tools for reef management, and high map accuracy is desirable to support appropriate decisions, such as the stratification of marine reserves by habitat class. While satelite sensors have been used to map different reef communities, the accuracy of these maps tends to be low (overall accuracy<50%) and optical airborne methods with high spectral resolution have, to date, been the most effective (if expensive) means of achieving higher accuracy. A potential means of compensating for the low spectral and radiometric resolution of optical satellite data, which is a major cause of its poor performance, is to combine satellite data with acoustic remote sensing. This study quantified the benefit of the synergy between optical satellite data (IKONOS) and acoustic (RoxAnn) sensors. The addition of acoustic data provided three new data axes for discriminating habitats: seabed roughness (E1), reef depth (z) and the depth correction of satellite spectral data to uniform depth. Seabed hardness (E2) was not an informative channel in our study. The use of z to conduct the water-column correction of the optical bands to uniform depth is a potential improvement over applying the depth-invariant index approach to optical data in the absence of ancillary information on depth. Habitat maps of the forereef of Glovers Atoll (Belize, Central America) were created using k-means unsupervised classification on eleven different treatment images constructed from various combinations of optical and acoustic data layers. The maximum benefit of data synergy was achieved by depth correcting the optical bands. The accuracy of maps based on the depth-invariant optical index was not enhanced when E1, E2 or z were added as separate layers but was enhanced when these three acoustic measures were added in concert. Data synergy can improve the accuracy of habitat maps and the availability of both data sets allows practitioners to take advantage of each techniques' additional strengths such as providing synoptic continuous imagery for education and general management planning (in the case of optical imagery) and maps of reef rugosity (in the case of acoustic data).

AB The objectives of this study were to quantify and analyze differences in laser height and laser intensity distributions of individual trees obtained from airborne laser scanner (ALS) data for different canopy conditions (leaf-on vs. leaf-off) and sensors. It was also assessed how estimated tree height, stem diameter, and tree species were influenced by these differences. The study was based on 412 trees from a boreal forest reserve in Norway. Three different ALS acquisitions were carried out. Leaf-on and leaf-off data were acquired with the Optech ALTM 3100 sensor, and an additional leaf-on dataset was acquired using the Optech ALTM 1233 sensor. Laser echoes located within the vertical projection of the tree crowns were attributed to different echo categories ("first echoes of many", "single echoes", "last echoes of many") and analyzed. The most pronounced changes in laser height distribution from leaf-on to leaf-off were found for the echo categories denoted as "single" and "last echoes of many" where the distributions were shifted towards the ground under leaf-off conditions. The most pronounced change in the intensity distribution was found for "first echoes of many" where the distribution was extremely skewed towards the lower values under leaf-off conditions compared to leaf-on. Furthermore, the echo height and intensity distributions obtained for the two different sensors also differed significantly. Individual tree properties were estimated fairly accurately in all acquisitions with RMSE ranging from 0.76 to 0.84 m for tree height and from 3.10 to 3.17 cm for stem diameter. It was revealed that tree species was an important model term in both and tree height and stem diameter models. A significantly higher overall accuracy of tree species classification was obtained using the leaf-off acquisition (90 vs. 98%) whereas classification accuracy did not differ much between sensors (90 vs. 93%).

AB To increase the application domain (re-use) of LiDAR-based models the random replication effects in the predictor(s) must be considered. We quantify these effects in a linear predictor (X) of four forest inventory attributes (Lorey's height HT, basal area BA, volume VOL, and stem density TPH) with LiDAR data acquired over 40 spruce-dominated large plots in southeastern Norway. A grid-based random thinning of the raw multi-echo LiDAR data, to five target densities between 0.25 m(-2) and 2.0 m(-2), generated 100 replications with each density. A DTM was estimated for each replicate and target pulse density. The four linear predictors were constructed from two indicators of canopy density and a posited average effect of a power-transform of echoes classified as canopy returns. Replication variance varied significantly among plots but the reliability ratio of X was high (>= 0.92) for HT, BA and VOL but lower for TPH, especially at low pulse densities. Reliability ratios increased with pulse density. Replication variance attenuated the linear regression coefficients by about 10% and inflated the residual variance by 3-6%. A proposed calibration was effective in reducing the impact of replication effects. A proposed bootstrap procedure can be used in practice to obtain good approximations of the replication variance. With echo-densities of approximately 1 m(-2) or higher the replication effects do not warrant the effort of a calibration. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Multiseason reflectance data from radiometrically and geometrically corrected multispectral SPOT-5 images of 10-m resolution were combined with thorough field campaigns and land cover digitizing using a binary classification tree algorithm to estimate the area of marshes covered with common reeds (Phragmites australis) and submerged macrophytes (Potamogeton pectinatus, A pusillus, Myriophyllum spicatum, Ruppia maritima, Chara sp.) over an area of 145,000 ha. Accuracy of these models was estimated by cross-validation and by calculating the percentage of correctly classified pixels on the resulting maps. Robustness of this approach was assessed by applying these models to an independent set of images using independent field data for validation. Biophysical parameters of both habitat types were used to interpret the misclassifications. The resulting trees provided a cross-validation accuracy of 98.7% for common reed and 97.4% for submerged macrophytes. Variables discriminating reed marshes from other land covers were the difference in the near-infrared band between March and June, the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index of December, and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) of September. Submerged macrophyte beds were discriminated with the shortwave-infrared band of December, the NDWI of September, the red band of September and the Simple Ratio index of March. Mapping validations provided accuracies of 98.6% (2005) and 98.1% (2006) for common reed, and 86.7% (2005) and 85.9% (2006) for submerged macrophytes. The combination of multispectral and multiseasonal satellite data thus discriminated these wetland vegetation types efficiently. Misclassifications were partly explained by digitizing inaccuracies, and were not related to biophysical parameters for reedbeds. The classification accuracy of submerged macrophytes was influenced by the proportion of plants showing on the water surface, percent cover of submerged species, water turbidity, and salinity. Classification trees applied to time series of SPOT-5 images appear as a powerful and reliable tool for monitoring wetland vegetation experiencing different hydrological regimes even with a small training sample (N = 25) when initially combined with thorough field measurements.

AB Spatial heterogeneity in ecosystem functioning is a key component of ecological variability requiring special attention in the context of global change. A large history of human use has produced high physiognomic heterogeneity in Mediterranean ecosystems. However, the consequences for ecosystem functioning remain insufficiently understood. We analyzed spectral indicators of matter and energy fluxes in the land surface to classify the functional ecosystem heterogeneity in a Mediterranean region covering different management histories and protection types. We specifically analyzed the spatial variability in seasonal and annual patterns in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), surface temperature (T-s) and albedo from five Landsat ETM images. Then we classified numerically this variability into ecosystem functional types (EFTs) and explored their seasonal dynamics in terms of photosynthetic radiation absorption and evapotranspiration. We identified eight main EFTs with ecologically relevant differences including contrasting dynamics in MAR seasonality, great variation in incoming radiation reflection and differing evapotranspiration rates, particularly during the water-limitation period. Functional variability in natural vegetation mostly consisted in dissimilar annual rates of NDVI and albedo, whereas differences in seasonality were more evident in transformed areas. Similarly, the spatial distribution of EFTs was partly associated to protection, with two EFTs exclusive of protected areas and comparatively higher functional diversity in humanized areas. Landform effects on water availability in protected areas and human activities under different ecological settings were seemingly responsible for the large functional diversity of the region. We advocate for the explicit incorporation of multifunctional ecosystem heterogeneity in ecosystem management and monitoring designs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Fitting a model to diurnal temperature cycles (DTC) of the land surface yields a set of parameters which summarizes the surface's thermal dynamics and is more informative and representative of its thermal characteristics than the individual land surface temperatures (LST). Modelling DTC is also useful for temporal compositing and for cloud screening. However, an earlier version of the DTC model presented in this article did not capture the smooth and gradual increase of LST around sunrise: this shortcoming is addressed here. Starting from the energy balance equation of the surface, a DTC model is developed which accounts for atmospheric attenuation of solar irradiation, the land surface's main heating source. By including total optical thickness (TOT), the new model reproduces the shape of morning rise of LST better, is able to "squash" DTC temporally, and more accurately reproduces the natural variability of DTC width and slope. Three different formulations of relative optical air mass are given and a Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation scheme is used to fit the DTC model to time series of LST which are obtained from ground based thermal infrared (TIR) data measured at permanent validation stations near "Gobabeb Training and Research Centre", Namibia, and near the town of Evora, Portugal. For turbid atmospheres (transparency 40%) the new model reduces the average deviation between modelled and measured LST by a factor of around three. Statistical analyses of 154 DTCs collected at the two validation sites show that the new DTC model consistently outperforms the earlier version of the model. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Global chlorophyll products derived from NASA's ocean color satellite programs have a nominal uncertainty of +/-35%. This metric has been hard to assess, in part because the data sets for evaluating performance do not reflect the true distribution of chlorophyll in the global ocean. A new technique is introduced that characterizes the chlorophyll uncertainty associated with distinct optical water types, and shows that for much of the open ocean the relative error is under 35%. This technique is based on a fuzzy classification of remote sensing reflectance into eight optical water types for which error statistics have been calculated. The error statistics are based on a data set of coincident MODIS Aqua satellite radiances and in situ chlorophyll measurements. The chlorophyll uncertainty is then mapped dynamically based on fuzzy memberships to the optical water types. The uncertainty maps are thus a separate, companion product to the standard MODIS chlorophyll product. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis (Land-SAF) aims to provide land surface variables for the meteorological and environmental science communities from EUMETSAT satellites. This study assesses the performance of a simplified (i.e. random distribution of vegetation is assumed) version of the Land-SAF algorithm for the estimation of Leaf Area Index (LAI) when prototyped with VEGETATION (processed in CYCLOPES program) and MODIS reflectances. The prototype estimates of LAI are evaluated both by comparison with validated CYCLOPES and MODIS LAI products derived from the same sensors and directly through comparison with ground-based estimates. Emphasis is given on evaluating the impact of the algorithm and input data on LAI retrieval discrepancies. Analysis is achieved over Europe for the 2000-2003 period. The results demonstrate the capacity of the Land-SAF algorithm to retrieve consistent LAI estimates from multiple optical sensors even when their reflectances present systematic differences. High spatial and temporal consistencies between Land-SAF prototype estimates and existing LAI products are found. The differences between Land-SAF and CYCLOPES LAI are lower than their uncertainties (RMSE (relative RMSE) within 0.4 (30%)). Land-SAF prototype estimates and MODIS LAI show larger discrepancies mainly due to differences in the vegetation structure representation and algorithm assumptions (RMSE ranging from 0.2 (30%) up to 0.8 (40%)). Land-SAF prototype provides higher LAI values than MODIS for herbaceous canopies (i.e. shrubs, grasses and crops) and lower values for woody biomes (i.e. savannas and forests). Direct validation indicates that LAI estimates from prototyping of the Land-SAF algorithm with CYCLOPES and MODIS reflectances achieve similar performances (differences with ground measurements are lower than 0.5 LAI units in 60% and 50% of the cases, respectively) as CYCLOPES and MODIS LAI products. Results from this prototyping exercise appear useful for improved retrieval of LAI and constitute a step forward for refinement, validation and consolidation of the Land-SAF algorithm.

AB Investigating the temporal and spatial pattern of landscape disturbances is an important requirement for modeling ecosystem characteristics, including understanding changes in the terrestrial carbon cycle or mapping the quality and abundance of wildlife habitats. Data from the Landsat series of satellites have been successfully applied to map a range of biophysical vegetation parameters at a 30 m spatial resolution; the Landsat 16 day revisit cycle, however, which is often extended due to cloud cover, can be a major obstacle for monitoring short term disturbances and changes in vegetation characteristics through time.
   The development of data fusion techniques has helped to improve the temporal resolution of fine spatial resolution data by blending observations from sensors with differing spatial and temporal characteristics. This study introduces a new data fusion model for producing synthetic imagery and the detection of changes termed Spatial Temporal Adaptive Algorithm for mapping Reflectance Change (STAARCH). The algorithm is designed to detect changes in reflectance, denoting disturbance, using Tasseled Cap transformations of both Landsat TM/ETM and MODIS reflectance data. The algorithm has been tested over a 185 x 185 km study area in west-central Alberta, Canada. Results show that STAARCH was able to identify spatial and temporal changes in the landscape with a high level of detail. The spatial accuracy of the disturbed area was 93% when compared to the validation data set, while temporal changes in the landscape were correctly estimated for 87% to 89% of instances for the total disturbed area. The change sequence derived from STAARCH was also used to produce synthetic Landsat images for the study period for each available date of MODIS imagery. Comparison to existing Landsat observations showed that the change sequence derived from STAARCH helped to improve the prediction results when compared to previously published data fusion techniques.

ID CORRECTION ALGORITHM; TERRAIN
AB In mountainous areas, slope and altitude variations modulate the airborne sensed hyperspectral radiance image. A new algorithm, SIERRA, has been developed for atmospheric, relief and BRDF corrections in order to extract the surface reflectance in the form of bi-hemispherical albedo that does not depend on solar incidence and observation angles. The forward modeling efforts focus on the estimation of diffuse irradiance and upwelling diffuse radiance, and on the formulation of BRDF effects. The inversion scheme consists of four steps, that go deeper and deeper into the phenomena's complexity.
   To validate the model, reflectance images are assessed from radiance images simulated with different radiative transfer codes or forward models: MODTRAN4 in the case of homogeneous and flat ground, AMARTIS and SIERRA forward models for heterogeneous and mountainous cases. The surface reflectance is retrieved with a 5% relative error under standard acquisition conditions.
   SIERRA is applied to HyMap data acquired over the hilly landscape near Calanas, Spain. The hypercube reflectances are compared with those obtained using ATCOR4 and COCHISE. The benefit of relief correction is clearly demonstrated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A significant proportion of high spatial resolution imagery in urban areas can be affected by shadows. Considerable research has been conducted to investigate shadow detection and removal in remotely sensed imagery. Few studies, however, have evaluated how applications of these shadow detection and restoration methods can help eliminate the shadow problem in land cover classification of high spatial resolution images in urban settings. This paper presents a comparison study of three methods for land cover classification of shaded areas from high spatial resolution imagery in an urban environment. Method I combines spectral information in shaded areas with spatial information for shadow classification. Method 2 applies a shadow restoration technique, the linear-correlation correction method to create a "shadow-free" image before the classification. Method 3 uses multisource data fusion to aid in classification of shadows. The results indicated that Method 3 achieved the best accuracy, with overall accuracy of 88%. It provides a significantly better means for shadow classification than the other two methods. The overall accuracy for Method 1 was 81.5%, slightly but not significantly higher than the 80.5% from Method 2. All of the three methods applied an object-based classification procedure, which was critical as it provides an effective way to address the problems of radiometric difference and spatial misregistration associated with multisource data fusion (Method 3), and to incorporate thematic spatial information (Method 1).

AB The combination of satellite remote sensing and carbon cycle models provides an opportunity for regional to global scale monitoring of terrestrial gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem production. FPAR (the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the plant canopy) is a critical input to diagnostic models, however little is known about the relative effectiveness of FPAR products from different satellite sensors nor about the sensitivity of flux estimates to different parameterization approaches. In this study, we used multiyear observations of carbon flux at four eddy covariance flux tower sites within the conifer biome to evaluate these factors. FPAR products from the MODIS and SeaWiFS sensors, and the effects of single site vs. cross-site parameter optimization were tested with the CFLUX model. The SeaWiFs FPAR product showed greater dynamic range across sites and resulted in slightly reduced flux estimation errors relative to the MODIS product when using cross-site optimization. With site-specific parameter optimization, the flux model was effective in capturing seasonal and interannual variation in the carbon fluxes at these sites. The cross-site prediction errors were lower when using parameters from a crosssite optimization compared to parameter sets from optimization at single sites. These results support the practice of multisite optimization within a biome or ecoregion for parameterization of diagnostic carbon flux models. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We describe in detail the implementation of the spectral optimization algorithm (SCA) for Case 2 waters for processing of ocean color data. This algorithm uses aerosol models and a bio-optical reflectance model to provide the top-of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. The parameters of both models are then determined by fitting the modeled TOA reflectance to that observed from space, using non-linear optimization. The algorithm will be incorporated into the SeaDAS software package as an optional processing switch of the Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 code. To provide potential users with an understanding of the accuracy and limitations of the algorithm, we generated a synthetic data set and tested the performance of the SCA with both correct and incorrect bio-optical model parameters. Application of the SOA to actual SeaWiFS data in the Lower Chesapeake Bay (for which surface measurements were available) showed that 20% errors in the bio-optical model parameters still enabled retrieval of chlorophyll a and the total absorption coefficient dissolved plus particulate detrital material at 443 nm with an error of less than 30% and 20%, respectively. In a companion paper we present a validation study of the application of the algorithm in the Chesapeake Bay. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using the NASA maintained ocean optical and biological in situ data that were collected during 2002-2005, we have evaluated the performance of atmospheric correction algorithms for the ocean color products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua. Specifically, algorithms using the MODIS shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands and an approach using the near-infrared (NIR) and SWIR combined method are evaluated, compared to the match-up results from the NASA standard algorithm (using the NIR bands). The in situ data for the match-up analyses were collected mostly from non-turbid ocean waters. It is critical to assess and understand the algorithm performance for deriving MODIS ocean color products, providing science and user communities with the important data quality information. Results show that, although the SWIR method for data processing has generally reduced the bias errors, the noise errors are increased due mainly to significantly lower sensor signal-noise ratio (SNR) values for the MODIS SWIR bands, as well as the increased uncertainties using the SWIR method for the atmospheric correction. This has further demonstrated that future ocean color satellite sensors will require significantly improved sensor SNR performance for the SWIR bands. The NIR-SWIR combined method, for which the non-turbid and turbid ocean waters are processed using the NIR and SWIR method, respectively, has been shown to produce improved ocean color products.

TI Spectroscopy of sediments in the Ganges-Brahmaputra delta: Spectral
   effects of moisture, grain size and lithology

AB The lithologic composition and grain size distribution of sediments are primary determinants of their inherent reflectance properties. However, moisture content is also known to have a strong influence on reflectances of soils and sediments. If the effects of sediment composition. grain size and moisture content could be distinguished spectrally, it might be possible to map these properties at synoptic scales using hyperspectral, or perhaps even broadband, remote sensing. Mapping the spatiotemporal distribution of sediment composition and moisture content could provide unique constraints on both the processes by which the sediments are deposited as well as the constraints they may impose on subsequent water flow and sediment transport. The Ganges-Brahmaputra delta (GBD) is formed by the convergence of these two great rivers and is superlative in both size and geologic activity. Sediment redistribution and channel migration associated with the annual floods disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of people living on the GBD but is also critical for maintaining the delta area fertile and above sea level. The 30+ year archive of Landsat imagery could provide a basis for spatiotemporal analysis of these fluvial dynamics if sediment properties could be inferred or measured from reflectance spectra. However, before confronting the challenge of broadband detection we must understand the spectral properties of the sediments under more controlled laboratory conditions. Bidirectional reflectance spectroscopy of 109 sediment samples from the GBD yields a spectral mixing space that appears to be structured by variations in moisture content, grain size and possibly lithology. Although the individual Empirical Orthogonal Functions of the Principal Components do not correspond to unique absorption features, clustering within the mixing space is clearly influenced by moisture content and grain size. Laboratory spectra of sediment reflectance measured under varying moisture content yield distinct trajectories through the spectral mixing space for different grain size distributions of sieved sediments. These variations in moisture content account for > 98% of spectral variance observed in these samples. Drying trajectories of coarse, fine and mixed sediments are distinct and suggest that moisture and grain size might be spectrally distinguishable. These results are consistent with Angstrom's hypothesis of moisture-driven spectral absorption but more controlled experiments are necessary to test the hypothesis rigorously.

AB This paper presents a physically-based approach for estimating critical variables describing land surface vegetation canopies, relying on remotely sensed data that can be acquired from operational satellite sensors. The REGularized canopy reFLECtance (REGFLEC) modeling tool couples leaf optics (PROSPECT), canopy reflectance (ACRM), and atmospheric radiative transfer (6SV1) model components, facilitating the direct use of at-sensor radiances in green, red and near-infrared wavelengths for the inverse retrieval of leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab) and total one-sided leaf area per unit ground area (LAI). The inversion of the canopy reflectance model is constrained by assuming limited variability of leaf structure, vegetation clumping, and leaf inclination angle within a given crop field and by exploiting the added radiometric information content of pixels belonging to the same field. A look-up-table with a suite of pre-computed spectral reflectance relationships, each a function of canopy characteristics, soil background effects and external conditions, is accessed for fast pixel-wise biophysical parameter retrievals. Using 1 m resolution aircraft and 10 m resolution SPOT-5 imagery, REGFLEC effectuated robust biophysical parameter retrievals for a corn field characterized by a wide range in leaf chlorophyll levels and intermixed green and senescent leaf material. Validation against in-situ observations yielded relative root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) on the order of 10% for the 1 m resolution LAI (RMSD=0.25) and C-ab (RMSD=4.4 mu g cm(-2)) estimates, due in part to an efficient correction for background influences. LAI and C-ab retrieval accuracies at the SPOT 10 m resolution were characterized by relative RMSDs of 13% (0.3) and 17% (7.1 mu g cm(-2)), respectively, and the overall intrafield pattern in LAI and C-ab was well established at this resolution. The developed method has utility in agricultural fields characterized by widely varying distributions of model variables and holds promise as a valuable operational tool for precision crop management. Work is currently in progress to extend REGFLEC to regional scales. Published by Elsevier Inc.

   data using overlapping footprints

ID ELEVATION; MODEL
AB Data from the ICESat/GLAS laser altimetry mission is used to obtain an estimate of the volume change of Greenland's ice sheet over the time span of February 2003 to April 2007. A novel processing strategy is developed and applied. It uses approximately 1 million ICESat elevation differences at geometrically overlapping footprints of both crossing and repeated tracks. The data are edited using quality flags defined by the ICESat/GLAS science team, as well as other additional criteria. In order to reduce the influence of surface slope, we propose a correction based on the ICESat/GLAS laser altimetry digital elevation model. Three slightly different processing strategies to convert the observed temporal elevation differences to elevation/volume changes are compared for 6 different drainage systems, further divided into regions above and below 2000 m in elevation. The final chosen strategy includes the correction for surface slopes, but does not include the removal of outlying elevation changes. For the region above 2000 m, a positive elevation change rate of 2 cm/year is obtained, which corresponds to a volume change rate of 21 km(3)/year. For the region below 2000 m the estimated elevation change rate is -24 cm/year, which corresponds to a volume loss of 168 km(3)/year. In general, the obtained results are in agreement with trends discovered by other authors that were also derived from laser altimetry. Nevertheless, the estimation obtained in this study suggests a more negative trend than those obtained previously. The differences can be explained by differences in the sampling of the region below 2000 m and, to a certain extent, by different time spans of the datasets used. A representative sampling of coastal areas is identified as the most critical issue for an accurate estimation of volume change rates in Greenland. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The area of North American forests affected by gypsy moth defoliation continues to expand despite efforts to slow the spread. With the increased area of infestation, ecological, environmental and economic concerns about gypsy moth disturbance remain significant, necessitating coordinated, repeatable and comprehensive monitoring of the areas affected. In this study, our primary objective was to estimate the magnitude of defoliation using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery for a gypsy moth outbreak that occurred in the US central Appalachian Mountains in 2000 and 2001. We focused on determining the appropriate spectral MODIS indices and temporal compositing method to best monitor the effects of gypsy moth defoliation. We tested MODIS-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and two versions of the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDIIb6 and NDIIb7, using the channels centered on 1640 turn and 2130 turn respectively) for their capacity to map defoliation as estimated by ground observations. In addition, we evaluated three temporal resolutions: daily, 8-day and 16-day data. We validated the results through quantitative comparison to Landsat based defoliation estimates and traditional sketch maps. Our MODIS based defoliation estimates based on NDIIb6 and NDIIb7 closely matched Landsat defoliation estimates derived from field data as well as sketch maps. We conclude that daily MODIS data can be used with confidence to monitor insect defoliation on an annual time scale, at least for larger patches (> 0.63 km(2)). Eight-day and 16-day MODIS composites may be of lesser use due to the ephemeral character of disturbance by the gypsy moth. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Measurements of physiology, chlorophyll fluorescence and hyperspectral reflectance were used to detect salinity stress in the evergreen coastal shrub, Myrica cerifera on Hog Island, Virginia. Two experimental sites were used in our study, the oceanside of a M. cerifera thicket, which is exposed to sea spray, and the protected, leeside of the thicket. Using the physiological reflectance index (PRI), we were able to detect stress at both the canopy and landscape level. Monthly variations in stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and relative water content indicated a strong summer drought response that was not apparent in chlorophyll fluorescence or in the water band index (WBI) derived from canopy and airborne reflectance measurements. In contrast, there were significant differences in both physiological measurements and tissue chlorides between the two sites used in the study, indicating salinity stress. This was reflected in measurements of PRI. There was a positive relationship between PRI measured at the canopy-level and light-adapted fluorescence (Delta F/F'(m),: r(2) = 0.69). PRI was significantly lower on the oceanside of the Myrica cerifera thicket. PRI was not significantly related to NDVI (r(2)=0.01) at the canopy-level and only weakly related (r(2)=0.04) at the landscape-level, suggesting that the indices are independent. The chlorophyll index (CI) did not show any significant changes between the two sites. Frequency histograms of pixels sampled from airborne hyperspectral imagery revealed that the distribution of PRI was shifted to the right on the backside of the thicket relative to the oecanside and there was a significant difference between sites. These results suggest that PRI may be used for early identification of salt-stress and to identify areas across the landscape where community structure may change due to sea-level rise.

AB This paper develops a statistical regression method to estimate the instantaneous Downwelling Surface Longwave Radiation (DSLR) for cloud-free skies using only the satellite-based radiances measured at the Top Of the Atmosphere (TOA), and subsequently combines the DSLR with the MODIS land surface temperature/emissivity Products (MOD11_L2) to estimate the instantaneous Net Surface Longwave Radiation (NSLR). The proposed method relates the DSLR directly to the TOA radiances in the MODIS Thermal InfraRed (TIR) channels provided that the terrain altitude and the satellite Viewing Zenith Angle (VZA) are known. The simulation analysis shows that the instantaneous DSLR could be estimated by the proposed method with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 12.4 W/m(2) for VZA=0 and terrain altitude z=0 km. Similar results are obtained for the other VZAs and altitudes. Considering the MODIS instrumental errors of 0.25 K for the TOA brightness temperatures in channels 28, 33 and 34, and of 0.05 K for channels 29 and 31, and of 0.35 K for channel 36, the overall retrieval accuracy in terms of the RMSE is decreased to 13.1 W/m(2) for the instantaneous DSLR. Moreover, a comparison of MODIS derived DSLR and NSLR are done with the field measurements made at six sites of the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) in the United States for days with cloud-free conditions at the moment of MODIS overpass in 2006. The results show that the bias, RMSE and the square of the correlation coefficient (R-2) between the MODIS derived DSLR with the proposed method and the field measured DSLR are 20.3 W/m(2), 30.1 W/m(2) and 0.91 respectively, and bias=11.7 W/m(2), RMSE=26.1 W/m(2) and R-2=0.94 for NSLR. In addition, the scheme proposed by Bisht et al. [Bisht, G., Venturini, V., Islam, S., & Jiang, L. (2005). Estimation of the net radiation using MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data for clear-sky days. Remote Sensing of Environment, 97, 52-67], which requires the MODIS atmospheric profile product (MOD07) and also the MODIS land surface temperature/emissivity products (MOD11_L2) as inputs, is Used to estimate the instantaneous DSLR and NSLR for comparison with the field measurements as well as the MODIS derived DSLR and NSLR using our proposed method. The results of the comparisons show that, at least for our cases, our proposed method for estimating DSLR from the MODIS radiances at the TOA and the resultant NSLR gives results comparable to those estimated with Bisht et al.'s scheme [Bisht, G., Venturini, V., Islam, S., & Jiang, L (2005).

AB A rapid canopy reflectance model inversion experiment was performed using multi-angle reflectance data from the NASA Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) on the Earth Observing System Terra satellite, with the goal of obtaining measures of forest fractional crown cover, mean canopy height, and aboveground woody biomass for large parts of south-eastern Arizona and southern New Mexico (>200,000 km(2)). MISR red band bidirectional reflectance estimates in nine views mapped to a 250 in grid were used to adjust the Simple Geometric-optical Model (SGM). The soil-understory background signal was partly decoupled a priori by developing regression relationships with the nadir camera blue, green, and near-infrared reflectance data and the isotropic, geometric, and volume scattering kernel weights of the LiSparse-RossThin kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model adjusted against MISR red band data. The SGM's mean crown radius and crown shape parameters were adjusted using the Praxis optimization algorithm, allowing retrieval of fractional crown cover and mean canopy height, and estimation of aboveground woody biomass by linear rescaling of the dot product of cover and height. Retrieved distributions of crown cover, mean canopy height, and aboveground woody biomass for forested areas showed good matches with maps from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, with R-2 values of 0.78, 0.69, and 0.81, and absolute mean errors of 0.10, 2.2 m, and 4.5 tons acre(-1) (10.1 Mg ha(-1)), respectively, after filtering for high root mean square error (RMSE) on model fitting, the effects of topographic shading, and the removal of a small number of outliers. This is the first use of data from the MISR instrument to produce maps of crown cover, canopy height, and woody biomass over a large area by seeking to exploit the structural effects of canopies reflected in the observed anisotropy patterns in these explicitly multiangle data.

AB This paper presents an approach to assess increase and decrease (2002-1997) of forest area and other wooded areas in a mire biotope in the Pre-alpine zone of Central Switzerland using logistic regression models and airborne remote sensing data (CIR aerial images, DSM derived from them). The present study was carried out in the framework of the Swiss Mire Protection Program, where increase and decrease of forest areas are key issues. In a first step, automatic DSMs were generated using an image matching approach from CIR aerial images of 1997 and 2002. In a second step, the DSMs were co-registered and normalized using LiDAR data. Tree layers from both years of various levels of detail were then generated combining canopy covers derived from normalized DSMs with a multi-resolution segmentation and a frizzy classification. On the basis of these tree layers, fractional tree/shrub covers were calculated using explanatory variables derived from these DSMs only. Bias was estimated by analysing the distribution of the fractional model differences. The corrected models reveal a decrease of tree/shrub probability which indicates a decrease of forest and other wooded areas between 1997 and 2002. The models also indicate real shrub encroachment in open mire. The detection of shrub encroachment may be helpful for selective logging purposes for sustainable mire habitat management. The study stresses the importance of high-resolution and high-quality DSMs and highlights the potential of fractional covers for ecological modeling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The primary purpose of ice-sheet altimetry is to monitor the changes in ice-sheet topography which may impact on global sea-level. However, the altimetric signal is sensitive to different properties of the snowpack, and therefore can also be used to determine these properties. The radar altimeter onboard the European Space Agency's ENVISAT satellite provides a dual-frequency dataset at Ku (13.6 GHz) and S band (3.2 GHz). In this paper, these signals are studied over the Antarctic ice-sheet during the 4 first years of the mission (2002-2006), in order to retrieve snowpack properties.
   The altimeter signal can be described by 4 classical waveform parameters. The 4 year time-series of all these parameters are decomposed into a linear and a seasonal time component. The linear component is almost constant. The distribution of the mean parameters over the Antarctic ice-sheet shows that the altimeter signal is sensitive to small-scale (mm) surface roughness.
   For the first time, the amplitudes and phases of the seasonal variations are characterized. The S band amplitudes are greater than the Ku band, and the phase varies over the entire ice-sheet. Previous studies suggested that the seasonal variations of the altitude from the altimeter are created by a decrease of the snowpack height through compaction. The dual-frequency observations shown here suggest that this hypothesis is too simple. Instead, the altitude variations observed in the altimetric signal are not created by the snowpack height change, but are more likely caused by the seasonal change of the snow properties, which cause a different response between the S and Ku bands. Therefore, both the linear and the seasonal variations of the altimetric signal can be used to retrieve snowpack properties.
   Here, we compare the dual-frequency ENVISAT signal with a model of the altimetric echo over the Antarctic ice-sheet. The model combines a surface model with a sub-surface model, for both the S and Ku bands. The Brown model [Brown G. S. (1977). The average impulse response of a rough surface and its applications. IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, 25, 1.] is used to describe the interaction of the radar wave with the snow surface. The backscatter coefficient of the surface is derived using the IEM method [Fung, A. K. (1994). Microwave scattering and emission models and their applications, Boston, MA: Artech House.]. The sub-surface signal takes into account both the layering effects and the scattering caused by the homogeneous media which is composed of small snow grains. The model is tested in two areas of the Antarctic plateau which present very different waveform parameters. The sensitivity of the radar signal to the different snowpack properties is investigated. The analysis of the waveform behaviours shows that the sub-surface signal can be completely :masked by the small-scale surface roughness signal.
   Finally, the temperature and surface density effects are investigated in order to explain the seasonal variations of the altimetric signal. Both the temperature and the compaction rate of the snow change seasonally. Temperature is shown to impact on the Ku band signal. Furthermore; the compaction rate of the snow surface can explain all of the seasonal variation characteristics observed at both the S and Ku bands. The seasonal change of compaction rate in the snow creates a change in the waveform shape that can bias the altitude. In particular, the snow compaction can induce a bias in the retrieved altimetric altitude of more than 80 cm for the Ku band and 1.5 m for the S band. This work underlines that the altitude time-series needs to be corrected for the shape of the altimetric echo over ice-sheets. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Information on the fractions of incident radiation reflected, transmitted and absorbed by a plant canopy is crucial in remote sensing of vegetation and modeling of canopy microclimate. Photon recollision probability p allows to calculate easily the spectral behavior of canopy scattering, i.e. the sum of canopy reflectance and transmittance. However, to divide the scattered radiation into reflected and transmitted fluxes, additional models are needed. In this paper, we present a simple formula to estimate the fraction of radiation scattered upwards by a canopy. The new method is semi-empirical, makes use of the concept of photon recollision probability, and is derived from an analysis of modeling results. Although a physical interpretation is given for the single additional parameter needed in the formula, the scattering asymmetry parameter q, the method is not strictly based on the radiative transfer equation. Our results indicate that the method is accurate for low to moderate leaf area index (LAI) values, and provides a reasonable approximation even at LAI=8. In addition, we present a method to compute p using numerical radiative transfer models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID COVER
AB A versatile data assimilation scheme for remote sensing snow cover products and meteorological data was developed, aimed at operational use for short-term runoff forecasting. Spatial and temporal homogenisation of the various input data sets is carried out, including meteorological point measurements from stations, numerical weather predictions, and snow maps from satellites. The meteorological data are downscaled to match the scale of the snow products, derived from optical satellite images of MODIS and from radar images of Envisat ASAR. Snow maps from SAR and optical imagery reveal systematic differences which need to be compensated for use in snowmelt models. We applied a semi-distributed model to demonstrate the use of satellite snow cover data for short-term runoff forecasting. During the snowmelt periods 2005 and 2006 daily runoff forecasts were made for the drainage basin Otztal (Austrian Alps) for time lags up to 6 days. Because satellite images were obtained intermittently, prognostic equations were applied to predict the daily snow cover extent for model update. Runoff forecasting uncertainty is estimated by using not only deterministic meteorological predictions as input, but also 51 ensemble predictions of the EPS system of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast. This is particularly important for water management tasks, because meteorological forecasts are the main error source for runoff prediction, as confirmed by simulation studies with modified input data from the various sources. Evaluation of the runoff forecasts reveals good agreement with the measurements, confirming the usefulness of the selected data processing and assimilation scheme for operational use.

AB Predicted latent and sensible heat fluxes from Land Surface Models (LSMs) are important lower boundary conditions for numerical weather prediction. While assimilation of remotely sensed surface soil moisture is a proven approach for improving root zone soil moisture, and presumably latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat flux predictions from LSMs, limitations in model physics and over-parameterisation mean that physically realistic soil moisture in LSMs will not necessarily achieve optimal heat flux predictions. Moreover, the potential for improved LE and H predictions from the assimilation of LE and H observations has received little attention by the scientific community, and is tested here with synthetic twin experiments. A one-dimensional single column LSM was used in 3-month long experiments, with observations of LE, H, surface soil moisture and skin temperature (from which LE and H are typically derived) sampled from truth model run outputs generated with realistic data inputs. Typical measurement errors were prescribed and observation data sets separately assimilated into a degraded model run using an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm, over temporal scales representative of available remotely sensed data. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between assimilation and truth model outputs across the experiment period were examined to evaluate LE, H, and root zone soil moisture and temperature retrieval. Compared to surface soil moisture assimilation as will be available from SMOS (every 3 days), assimilation of LE and/or H using a best case MODIS scenario (twice daily) achieved overall better predictions for LE and comparable H predictions, while achieving poorer soil moisture predictions. Twice daily skin temperature assimilation achieved comparable heat flux predictions to LE and/or H assimilation. Fortnightly (Landsat) assimilations of LE, H and skin temperature performed worse than 3-day moisture assimilation. While the different spatial resolutions of these remote sensing data have been ignored, the potential for LE and H assimilation to improve model predicted LE and H is clearly demonstrated.

AB This study developed a coupled land-atmosphere satellite data assimilation system as a new physical downscaling approach, by coupling a mesoscale atmospheric model with a land data assimilation system (LDAS). The LDAS consists of a land surface scheme as the model operator, a radiative transfer model as the observation operator, and the simulated annealing method for minimizing the difference between the observed and simulated microwave brightness temperature. The atmospheric model produces forcing data for the LDAS, and the LDAS produces better initial surface conditions for the modelling system. This coupled system can take into account land surface heterogeneities through assimilating satellite data for a better precipitation prediction. To assess the effectiveness of the new system, 3-dimensional numerical experiments were carried out in a mesoscale area of the Tibetan Plateau during the wet monsoon season. The results show significant improvement compared with a no assimilation regional atmospheric model simply nested from the global model. The surface soil moisture content and its distribution from the assimilation system were more consistent to in situ observations. These better surface conditions affect the land-atmosphere interactions through convection systems and lead to better atmospheric predictability as confirmed by satellite-based cloud observations and in situ sounding observations. Through the use of satellite brightness temperature, the developed coupled land-atmosphere assimilation system has shown potential ability to provide better initial surface conditions and its inputs to the atmosphere and to improve physical downscaling through regional models.

AB Landsat data have been widely used for change detection studies of forest ecosystems. Technical issues related to the longevity and quality of the Landsat-5 and -7 instruments prompted this investigation into how data from other sensors may be integrated with the existing Landsat image archive. Change maps indicating the location and extent of stand replacing disturbances occurring between 1999 and 2004 were developed using a rank-order change detection approach. The near-infrared (NIR) band from an image representing initial stand conditions (T1: Landsat-7 ETM+), and the NIR band of images acquired on subsequent dates and with different sensors (T2: ASTER, SPOT-4, and Landsat-5 TM) were selected, essentially acting as three different T2 images. Pair-wise comparisons between the T1 image and each of the T2 images required the pixel values to be sorted. ranked, and differenced; a threshold was then applied to the difference values to identify the stand replacing disturbances. The rank-order change detection approach precluded the need for an additional image normalization process. When compared to a manually interpreted map of change events, the output from the ASTER, SPOT-4, and Landsat-5 TM data were all equally effective in identifying all of the stand replacing disturbances that occurred between 1999 and the year of T2 image acquisition, and errors of commission were minimal. Important logistical limitations to cross-sensor change do exist however and include the lack of spatially or temporally extensive image archives for sensors other than Landsat, incompatible image footprints, and data cost and policy. This rank-order change detection approach is suitable for applications involving multi-temporal datasets where problems may exist due to image normalization, cross-sensor radiometric calibration, or unavailability of a desired sensor type.

AB Soil moisture status in the root zone is an important component of the water cycle at all spatial scales (e.g., point, field, catchment, watershed, and region). In this study, the spatio-temporal evolution of root zone soil moisture of the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in Arizona was investigated during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 (SMEX04). Root zone soil moisture was estimated via assimilation of aircraft-based remotely sensed surface soil moisture into a distributed Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model. An ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) based on a Kalman filtering scheme was used for assimilating the aircraft-based soil moisture observations at a spatial resolution of 800 m x 800 m. The SWAP model inputs were derived from the SSURGO soil database, LAI (Leaf Area Index) data from SMEX04 database, and data from meteorological stations/rain gauges at the WGEW. Model predictions are presented in terms of temporal evolution of soil moisture probability density function at various depths across the WGEW. The assimilation of the remotely sensed surface soil moisture observations had limited influence on the profile soil moisture. More specifically, root zone soil moisture depended mostly on the soil type. Modeled soil moisture profile estimates were compared to field measurements made periodically during the experiment at the ground based soil moisture stations in the watershed. Comparisons showed that the ground-based soil moisture observations at various depths were within +/-1 standard deviation of the modeled profile soil moisture. Density plots of root zone soil moisture at various depths in the WGEW exhibited multi-modal variations due to the uneven distribution of precipitation and the heterogeneity of soil types and soil layers across the watershed.

AB High temporal frequency remote sensing observations are required to monitor vegetation functioning. These observations are currently provided by moderate resolution sensor (with pixel size ranging from 250 m to 10 km). However, the intra-pixel spatial heterogeneity which may be important at moderate resolution, induces a scaling bias on non-linear estimation processes of land surface variable. A possible strategy to correct this scaling bias consists in using variogram model of high spatial resolution data (e.g. SPOT/HRV 20 m) as a proxy for the spatial heterogeneity within moderate resolution pixel. However, ways have to be found to get prior knowledge of this intra-pixel spatial heterogeneity metric without systematic concurrent high spatial resolution images. This paper aims at proposing a spatio-temporal model of the variogram of high spatial resolution data, which enables us to retrieve the spatial heterogeneity within moderate spatial resolution pixel using a temporal sampling of few high spatial resolution scenes. It capitalizes on variogram modeling of a time series of high spatial resolution NDVI images to quantify and model the temporal changes in landscape spatial heterogeneity over a particular crop site (Fundulea, Romania). We first demonstrate that important temporal variations in surface spatial heterogeneity observed over an agricultural site mainly result from the shift in seasonal trajectories between crop classes (here winter versus summer crops). The mean length scale as measured by the variogram integral range is mainly influenced by the gathering of fields with similar NDVI values. The scene overall spatial variability and the spatial heterogeneity within moderate resolution pixels, as quantified by the variogram. sill and the dispersion variance, respectively, increase with the difference in NDVI between winter and summer crops. The influence of surface spatial heterogeneity on the description of land surface processes is thus critical when the phenological variability between crop classes is maximum, suggesting that the number of high spatial resolution scenes should increase at these periods of the seasonal cycle. Then, based on these observations, we build a model describing the temporal course of surface spatial heterogeneity, i.e. the temporal trajectory of the variogram of high spatial resolution NDVI image, as a function of crop seasonality. Once calibrated from a temporal sampling of few high spatial resolution scenes, this model proves to be powerful to predict the variogram at a date at which the high spatial resolution scene is not available and thus to retrieve the spatial heterogeneity within moderate resolution pixels through the seasonal cycle within a mean relative uncertainty of 20%.

AB A physically based algorithm for the retrieval of total water vapor column (TWC) over cloud-free land Surfaces proposed by Kleespies and McMillin [Kleespies, J.T., McMillin L.M. (1990). Retrieval of precipitable water from observations in the Split Window over varying surface temperatures. Journal of Applied Meteorology, 29, 851-862.] is evaluated and extended for use in atmospheric correction and surface irradiance calculation schemes. Thermal infrared split window channels at 10.8 and 12.0 gm of the MSG-SEVIRI (Meteosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) instrument are used. The proposed algorithm takes advantage of the improved measurement capabilities of the MSG-SEVIRI instrument with its 15 min temporal resolution and its radiometric accuracy of 0.25 K and 0.37 K in the 10.8 and 12.0 gm channels. The temporal resolution allows exploitation of the daily land surface temperature variation. There is no further need for explicit auxiliary information on air and land surface temperatures, which is difficult to obtain on an operational basis. Updated coefficients for the split window parameterization are derived based on simulations of 'top-of-atmosphere' SEVIRI brightness temperatures for the globally representative Thermodynamic Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR3) set of radiosonde profiles. It turns out that the linear dependency on the transmission ratio in both split window channels as originally proposed by Kleespies & McMillin [Kleespies, J.T., McMillin L.M. (1990). Retrieval of precipitable water from observations in the Split Window over varying surface temperatures. Journal of Applied Meteorologv, 29, 851-862.] has to be extended towards a non-linear approach in order to make it applicable to the full range of global atmospheric conditions. Sensitivity studies reveal that the parameterization relies on the availability of input brightness temperatures with a variation larger than approximately 5 K during the daily cycle. The new TWC algorithm was tested with MSG-SEVIRI data for European and African regions for the period March-August 2004 and compared with radiosonde data. The results show that the algorithm is capable of producing TWC values with a mean bias of -0.2 min and an RMSE of 6.8 min. From the total amount of 2583 coincidences for all viewing zenith angles both for winter and summer conditions, 82% were within a 5 min and 94% were within a 10 min difference interval between MSG-based and radiosonde-based TWC. A second comparison to European GPS measurements for the same period from March to August 2004 reveals a bias of -3.0 mm and an RMSE of 6.0 mm. This result is obtained for 11 UTC GPS measurements which proved to match best the MSG-TWC values. Comparing MSG-TWC to daily cloud-free mean GPS values shows a lower bias of -2.56 min and an increased RMSE of 6.6 mm. These findings support the usefulness of the new MSG-based algorithm for surface irradiance calculations and atmospheric correction purposes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses a few issues that are fundamental for the understanding of vegetation-topography relations: scale dependency, seasonal variability, and importance of observing individual properties. Particularly, it uses two statistical tools - Pearson's r and Moran's I - to define relationships of several topographic attributes with the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII), and their seasonal changes (from May to July and then September) in the Mediterranean-type landscape of the Santa Monica Mountains, California. The analyses are conducted at both the original data resolution and 20 aggregated resolutions, covering a total range of 30 m to 1500 m, so that topography-vegetation relationships can be compared at different scales. Large sample sizes have supported the significance of the following main findings for this landscape. First, elevation, slope, and southness are the most relevant primary topographic attributes among the tested attributes and their importance changes across seasons. Second, NDVI, NDII, and their seasonal variations have notably different relationships (including no relationship) with topography. Third, the observed topography-vegetation correlations (r) tend to change - typically increase - with the coarsening of spatial scale. Lastly, the spatial autocorrelation of vegetation variables and topographic attributes are often comparable, and the comparability is more apparent when topography-vegetation correlations are stronger. In all, the topography-NDVI/NDII relations defined in this paper may improve the understanding of the multi-scale and property-specific role that mountain topography plays in the formation and seasonal change of vegetation patterns.

AB The performance of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared (TIR) data product algorithms was evaluated for low spectral contrast surfaces (such as vegetation and water) in a test site close to Valencia, Spain. Concurrent ground measurements of surface temperature, emissivity, and atmospheric radiosonde profiles were collected at the test site, which is a thermally homogeneous area of rice crops with nearly full vegetation cover in summer. Using the ground data and the local radiosonde profiles, at-sensor radiances were simulated for the ASTER TIR channels and compared with LIB data (calibrated at-sensor radiances) showing discrepancies up to 3% in radiance for channel 10 at 8.3 mu m (equivalently, 2.5 degrees C in temperature or 7% in emissivity), whereas channel 13 (10.7 mu m) yielded a closer agreement (maximum difference of 0.5% in radiance or 0.4 degrees C in temperature). We also tested the ASTER standard products of land surface temperature (LST) and spectral emissivity generated with the Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm with standard atmospheric correction from both global data assimilation system profiles and climatology profiles. These products showed anomalous emissivity spectra with lower emissivity values and larger spectral contrast (or maximum-minimum emissivity difference, MMD) than expected, and as a result, overestimated LSTs. In this work, a scene-based procedure is proposed to obtain more accurate MMD estimates for low spectral contrast materials (vegetation and water) and therefore a better retrieval of LST and emissivity with the TES algorithm. The method uses various gray-bodies or near gray-bodies with known emissivities and assumes that the calibration and atmospheric correction performed with local radiosonde data are accurate for channel 13. Taking the channel 13 temperature (atmospherically and emissivity corrected) as the true LST, the radiances for the other channels were simulated and used to derive linear relationships between ASTER digital numbers and at-ground radiances for each channel. The TES algorithm was applied to the adjusted radiances and the resulting products showed a closer agreement with the ground measurements (differences lower than 1% in channel 13 emissivities and within +/- 0.3 degrees C in temperature for rice and sea pixels).

AB Predicting structural organization and biomass of tropical forest from remote sensing observation constitutes a great challenge. We assessed the potential of Fourier-based textural ordination (FOTO) to estimate mangrove forest biomass from very high resolution (VHR) IKONOS images. The FOTO method computes texture indices of canopy grain by performing a standardized principal component analysis (PCA) on the Fourier spectra obtained for image windows of adequate size. For two distinct study sites in French Guiana, FOTO indices derived from a I m panchromatic channel were able to consistently capture the whole gradient of canopy grain observed from the youngest to decaying stages of mangrove development, without requiring any intersite image correction. In addition, a multiple linear regression based on the three main textural indices yielded accurate predictions of mangrove total aboveground biomass. Since FOTO indices did not saturate for high biomass values, predictions were furthermore unbiased, even for levels above 450 t of dry matter per hectare. Maps of canopy texture (with RGB coding) and biomass were then produced over 8000 ha of unexplored, low accessibility mangrove. Applying the FOTO method to the 4 m near-infrared channel yielded acceptable results with some limitations for characterization of juvenile mangrove types. We finally discuss the influence of technical aspects pertaining to VHR images and to FOTO implementation (especially the size of the window used to compute Fourier spectra) and we evoke the interesting prospect of broad regional validity offered by the method to characterize high biomass tropical forest from standardized measures of canopy grain.

AB Multi-temporal change detection is commonly used in the detection of changes to ecosystems. Differencing single band indices derived from multispectral pre- and post-fire images is one of the most frequently used change detection algorithms. In this paper we examine a commonly used index used in mapping fire effects due to wildland fire. Subtracting a post-fire from a pre-fire image derived index produces a measure of absolute change which then can be used to estimate total carbon release, biomass loss, smoke production, etc. Measuring absolute change however, may be inappropriate when assessing ecological impacts. In a pixel with a sparse tree canopy for example, differencing a vegetation index will measure a small change due stand-replacing fire. Similarly, differencing will produce a large change value in a pixel experiencing stand-replacing fire that had a dense pre-fire tree canopy. If all stand-replacing fire is defined as severe fire, then thresholding an absolute change image derived through image differencing to produce a categorical classification of burn severity can result in misclassification of low vegetated pixels. Misclassification of low vegetated pixels also happens when classifying severity in different vegetation types within the same fire perimeter with one set of thresholds. Comparisons of classifications derived from thresholds of dNBR and relative dNBR data for individual fires may result in similar classification accuracies. However, classifications of relative dNBR data can produce higher accuracies on average for the high burn severity category than dNBR classifications derived from a universal set of thresholds applied across multiple fires. This is important when mapping historic fires where precise field based severity data may not be available to aid in classification. Implementation of a relative index will also allow a more direct comparison of severity between fires across space and time which is important for landscape level analysis. In this paper we present a relative version of dNBR based upon field data from 14 fires in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California, USA. The methods presented may have application to other types of disturbance events. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB MODIS and MISR are two Earth Observing System instruments flown onboard the TerTa satellite. Their synergistic use could greatly benefit the broad user community by ensuring a global view of the Earth with high-quality products. A necessary condition for data fusion is radiometric calibration agreement between the two instruments. Earlier studies showed about 3% absolute radiometric difference between MISR and respective MODIS land bands in the visible and near-IR spectrum, which are also used in aerosol and cloud research. This study compared two surface albedo products derived from MODIS and MISR LIB data using the AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (ASRVN). The ASRVN shows a positive MISR-MODIS albedo bias of + (0.01-0.03). Cross-sensor calibration inconsistencies were identified as a primary cause of the albedo biases. To establish an independent MODIS-MISR calibration link, top-of-atmosphere MODIS and MISR reflectances were regressed against each other over liquid water clouds. The empirical regression results have been adjusted for the differences in the respective MISR and MODIS spectral responses using radiative transfer simulations. The MISR-MODIS band gain differences for the top-of-atmosphere reflectance estimated with this technique are +6.0% in the Blue, +3.3% in the Green, +2.7% in the Red, and +0.8% in the NIR band. Applying the derived values to rescale the MODIS or MISR LIB data is shown to significantly reduce the cross-sensor ASRVN surface albedo biases. An absolute calibration scale for both sensors could be established based on independent ground-based measurements of the surface albedo at selected AERONET sites. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper presents an approach for estimating aerosol absorption by combining MODIS and MISR data. The approach uses a previously published concept based on combining clear and hazy days to retrieve aerosol absorption. It augments the existing approach by using multi-sensor data to improve the surface characterization and aerosol property retrieval. MODIS data are used to retrieve the aerosol optical thickness, whereas MISR data are first used to determine the surface properties on the clear day, and then to retrieve aerosol absorption on hazy days by using the derived surface properties as the ground boundary condition. The method is applied to two extreme cases of absorption in biomass burning situations: One case over Mongu (South Africa) and the other over Alta Floresta (Brazil). The range of single scattering albedo retrieved values is from 0.7 to 0.95. A comparison with AERONET independent estimates shows very good agreement (better than 0.02 on average) across the whole range. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A simple data analysis technique for vegetation leaf area index (LAI) using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data is presented. The objective is to generate LAI data that is appropriate for numerical weather prediction. A series of techniques and procedures which includes data quality control, time-series data smoothing, and simple data analysis is applied. The LAI analysis is an optimal combination of the MODIS observations and derived climatology, depending on their associated errors sigma(o) and sigma(c). The "best estimate" LAI is derived from a simple three-point smoothing technique combined with a selection of maximum LAI (after data quality control) values to ensure a higher quality. The LAI climatology is a time smoothed mean value of the "best estimate" LAI during the years of 2002-2004. The observation error is obtained by comparing the MODIS observed LAI with the "best estimate" of the LAI, and the climatological error is obtained by comparing the "best estimate" of LAI with the climatological LAI value. The LAI analysis is the result of a weighting between these two errors. Demonstration of the method described in this paper is presented for the 15-km grid of Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC)'s regional version of the numerical weather prediction model. The final LAI analyses have a relatively smooth temporal evolution, which makes them more appropriate for environmental prediction than the original MODIS LAI observation data. They are also more realistic than the LAI data currently used operationally at the MSC which is based on land-cover databases. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Global warming has obtained more and more attention because the global mean surface temperature has increased since the late 19th century. As more than 50% of the human population lives in cities, urbanization has become an important contributor for global warming. Pearl River Delta (PRD) in Guangdong Province, southern China, is one of the regions experiencing rapid urbanization that has resulted in remarkable Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which will be sure to influence the regional climate, environment, and socio-economic development. In this study, Landsat TM and ETM+ images from 1990 to 2000 in the PRD were selected to retrieve the brightness temperatures and land use/cover types. A new index, Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI), was proposed to extract bare land from the satellite images. Additionally, Shenzhen, which has experienced the fastest urbanization in Guangdong Province, was taken as an example to analyze the temperature distribution and changes within a large city as its size expanded in the past decade. Results show that the UHI effect has become more prominent in areas of rapid urbanization in the PRD region. The spatial distribution of heat islands has been changed from a mixed pattern, where bare land, semi-bare land and land under development were warmer than other surface types, to extensive UHI. Our analysis showed that higher temperature in the UHI was located with a scattered pattern, which was related to certain land-cover types. In order to analyze the relationship between UHI and land-cover changes, this study attempted to employ a quantitative approach in exploring the relationship between temperature and several indices, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI) and Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI). It was found that correlations between NDVI, NDWI, NDBaI and temperature are negative when NDVI is limited in range, but positive correlation is shown between NDBI and temperature.

First, the single date and integrated vegetation index approach, which quantify, the amount of herbaceous biomass at the end of the rain season, were evaluated using in situ biomass data. It was shown that the integral of the Ratio Vegetation Index (iRVI) during the rain season was the most suitable index to estimate herbaceous biomass (R-2=0.69). Next, the performance of single, greenness, and accumulated remotely sensed fire risk indices, related to vegetation water content, were evaluated using fire activity data. The Accumulated Relative Normalised Difference Vegetation Index Decrement (ARND) performed the best when estimating fire risk (c-index=0.76). Finally, results confirmed that the assessment of fire risk was improved by combination of both the vegetation biomass (iRVI) and vegetation water content (ARND) related indices (c-index =0.80). The monitoring of vegetation biomass and water content with SPOT VEGETATION time-series provided a more suitable tool for fire management and suppression compared to satellite-based fire risk assessment methods, only related to vegetation water content.

AB Hyperspectral data coverage from the EO-1 Hyperion sensor was useful for calibrating Advanced Land Imager (ALI) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images of a volcanic terrane area of the Chilean-Bolivian Altiplano. Following calibration, the ALI and ASTER datasets were co-registered and joined to produce a 13-channel reflectance cube spanning the Visible to Short Wave Infrared (0.4-2.4 mu m). Eigen analysis and comparison of the Hyperion data with the ALI+ASTER reflectance data, as well as mapping results using various ALI+ASTER data subsets, provided insights into the information dimensionality of all the data. In particular, high spectral resolution, low signal-to-noise Hyperion data were only marginally better for mineral mapping than the merged 13-channel, low spectral resolution, high signal-to-noise ALI+ASTER dataset. Neither the Hyperion nor the combined ALI+ASTER datasets had sufficient information dimensionality for mapping the diverse range of surface materials exposed on the Altiplano. However, it is possible to optimize the use of the multispectral data for mineral-mapping purposes by careful data subsetting, and by employing other appropriate image-processing strategies.

AB A new technique is described that detects when and where new snow falls on ice sheets and then determines the thickness of new accumulation. Measurements of vertically polarized passive emission at 85 GHz are filtered with the Hilbert-Huang Transform to identify periods where the surface snow has changed significantly. These are shown to be commonly the result of new snow by comparison with both field observations and in situ instrumentation. Temperature, atmospheric emission and clouds all affect the passive microwave signal but each is examined and shown not to prevent the identification of new snow events. The magnitude of the brightness temperature change is not strongly correlated with snowfall amount. To quantify the amount of new snow, the spatial extent and timing of new snowfalls are examined with ICESat/ GLAS laser altimetry data. Crossover differences between altimetric profiles taken before, during, and after the snowfall event provide a measure of the thickness of new snow. Specific cases are presented where 11 and 13 cm of new snow were detected over large regions. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Reflectance measurements acquired with the spaceborne POLDER instrument are used to analyze the variability of land surface directional signatures as a function of vegetation cover type. The reflectance directional signatures are quantified by the three parameters of a modified version of the Ross-Li reflectance model. The variability of the estimated parameters with respect to the seven MODIS biome classes was found to be higher within the classes than between classes, with the exception of the desert targets that show more isotropic reflectances. A limited number of standard BRDFs (typically 5 in the red and near infrared) capture most of the variability of the directional reflectance measurements, supporting the idea that different land surfaces have similar directional signatures. Over vegetation targets, they are characterized by a strong increase toward backscattering and much smaller variations in forward directions. The results express the diversity in structural situations within a given biome class and indicate that, at the resolution of the POLDER sensor, i.e. a few kilometers, the BRDF contains little information on the dominant vegetation type. We show that standard directional signatures may be used to correct the reflectance measurements for directional effects with an RMS error on the order of 0.011 in the red and 0.015 in the near infrared.

AB Global satellite ocean color instruments provide the scientific community a high-resolution means of studying the marine biosphere. Satellite data product validation and algorithm development activities both require the substantial accumulation of high-quality in-situ observations. The NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group maintains a local repository of in-situ marine bio-optical data, the SeaWiFS Biooptical Archive and Storage System (SeaBASS), to facilitate their ocean color satellite validation analyses. Data were acquired from SeaBASS and used to compile a large set of coincident radiometric observations and phytoplankton pigment concentrations for use in biooptical algorithm development. This new data set, the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Data set (NOMAD), includes over 3400 stations of spectral water-leaving radiances, surface irradiances, and diffuse downwelling attenuation coefficients, encompassing chlorophyll a concentrations ranging from 0.012 to 72.12 mg m(-3). Metadata, such as the date, time, and location of data collection, and ancillary data, including sea surface temperatures and water depths, accompany each record. This paper describes the assembly and evaluation of NOMAD, and further illustrates the broad geophysical range of stations incorporated into NOMAD. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite imagery was used to detect the change in seagrass and macroalgal communities of a shallow coastal lake over a period of 14 years. The lake benthic material was classified into sets of spectral classes representing the patterns and texture of the ecosystem, and then linked to environmentally relevant labels through a radiative transfer model. The classification results for 2002 achieved an accuracy of 76% for the least understood areas; other areas were significantly better, but not quantified. Classification results of 1988, 1991, and 1995 were consistent with past surveys and maps. Based on the change detection from 1988 to 2002 Posidonia, Ruppia and Halophila change slightly in the 14 year period from 1988 to 2002. However, Zostera has undergone significant change and adaptation. Early in the time series (between 1988 and 1991) a reduction in Zostera beds was evident, especially in the middle and south of the take with some areas not returning by 2002. Epiphytic growth over Zostera could be a confounding factor here, but the Landsat sensors do not have sufficient spectral resolution to detect these subtleties. Hyperspectral remote sensing could resolve this issue more clearly. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Passive optical multiangle observations make possible the retrieval of scene structural characteristics that cannot be obtained with, or require fewer underlying assumptions than, single-angle sensors. Retrievable quantities include aerosol amount over a wide variety of surfaces (including bright targets); aerosol microphysical properties such as particle shape; geometrically-derived cloud-top heights and 3-D cloud morphologies; distinctions between polar clouds and ice; and textural measures of sea ice, ice sheets, and vegetation. At the same time, multiangle data are necessary for accurate retrievals of radiative quantities such as surface and top-of-atmosphere albedos, whose magnitudes are governed by structural characteristics of the reflecting media and which involve angular integration over intrinsically anisotropic intensity fields. Measurements of directional radiation streams also provide independent checks on model assumptions conventionally used in satellite retrievals, such as the application of 1-D radiative transfer theory, and provide data required to constrain more sophisticated, 3-D approaches. In this paper, the value of multiangle remote sensing in establishing physical correspondence and self-consistency between scene structural and radiative characteristics is demonstrated using simultaneous observations from instruments aboard NASA's Terra satellite (MISR, CERES, ASTER, and MODIS). Illustrations pertaining to the remote sensing of clouds, aerosols, ice, and vegetation properties are presented. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Near real-time data from the MODIS satellite sensor was used to detect and trace a harmful algal bloom (HAB), or red tide, in SW Florida coastal waters from October to December 2004. MODIS fluorescence line height (FLH in W m(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1)) data showed the highest correlation with near-concurrent in situ chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl in mg m(-3)). For Chl ranging between 0.4 to 4 mg m(-3) the ratio between MODIS FLH and in situ Chl is about 0.1 W m(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) per mg m(-3) chlorophyll (Chl = 1.255 (FLH x 10)(0.86), r = 0.92, n = 77). In contrast, the band-ratio chlorophyll product of either MODIS or SeaWiFS in this complex coastal environment provided false information. Errors in the satellite Chl data can be both negative and positive (3 - 15 times higher than in situ Chl) and these data are often inconsistent either spatially or temporally, due to interferences of other water constituents. The red tide that formed from November to December 2004 off SW Florida was revealed by MODIS FLH imagery, and was confirmed by field sampling to contain medium (10(4) to 10(5) cells L-1) to high (> 10(5) cells L-1) concentrations of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. The FLH imagery also showed that the bloom started in mid-October south of Charlotte Harbor, and that it developed and moved to the south and southwest in the subsequent weeks. Despite some artifacts in the data and uncertainty caused by factors such as unknown fluorescence efficiency, our results show that the MODIS FLH data provide an unprecedented tool for research and managers to study and monitor algal blooms in coastal environments.

AB This paper presents a geomatics-based approach for the operational monitoring of spatio-temporal changes in a northern wetland. It demonstrates how valuable, and otherwise unattainable, spatially distributed and timely baseline data can be obtained using basic remote sensing techniques. It further shows how these data can be combined to retrieve information pertaining to the hydro-ecological relationships in the wetland. The study was conducted in the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), which is a large wetland complex in northeastern Alberta, Canada. Combinations of Radarsat Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical satellite images (Landsat or SPOT multispectral) were used to generate a time-series of flood maps for the six-year period, 1996 to 2001. These maps clearly depict the extent of the 1996 and 1997 overland, floods and the subsequent water level draw down. A flood duration map that shows how long each image cell was inundated was generated by combining the series of flood maps. The flood duration map highlights regions where the duration of flooding appears to be highest or lowest. Such maps are invaluable for any ecological change detection protocols that may be developed for this region. The general vegetation patterns were also mapped using multi-temporal SPOT-4 images from the summer season (May and August) of 2001 to an accuracy of 86%. By comparing the vegetation and flood duration maps, the relationship between vegetation patterns and duration of flooding could be examined. Results indicated that basins inundated for longer periods (3-5 years) were dominated by relatively more productive graminoid (grass-like) vegetation, whereas, areas flooded for less than two years were characterised by less productive shrub vegetation. Airborne scanning LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data from the summer (June) of 2000 were also used to generate a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of selected non-flooded areas. LiDAR DEM accuracy was satisfactory (Root Mean Square Error of 0.24 m) and it proved to be sufficiently detailed to detect the subtle topographic patterns in this relatively flat region. Comparison of the vegetation map to the DEM demonstrated that the shrubs were located in areas that were, on average, between 0.5 m (in south) and 0.73 m (in north) higher than the graminoid covered regions. Notwithstanding other parameters that influence the distribution of vegetation, these results indicate that flood duration and elevation are two important factors. The usefulness of these spatial databases recommends the timely generation of flood and vegetation maps in the continued monitoring of the changes and relationships in this delta.

AB The objective of this investigation is to analyze the sensitivity of ASAR (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar) data to soil surface parameters (surface roughness and soil moisture) over bare fields, at various polarizations (HII, HV, and VV) and incidence angles (20'-43''). The relationships between backscattering coefficients and soil parameters were examined by means of 16 ASAR images and several field campaigns. We have found that HH and HV polarizations are more sensitive than VV polarization to Surface roughness. The results also show that the radar signal is more sensitive to surface roughness at high incidence angle (43). However, the dynamics of the radar signal as a function of soil roughness are weak for root mean square (rms) surface heights between 0.5 cm and 3.50 cm (only 3 dB for lift polarization and 43 incidence angle). The estimation of soil moisture is optimal at low and medium incidence angles (20 37). The backscattering coefficient is more sensitive to volumetric soil moisture in Fill polarization than in HV polarization, In fact. the results show that the depolarization ratio sigma(0)(HH)/sigma(0)(HV) is weakly dependent on the roughness condition, whatever the radar incidence. On the other hand, we observe a linear relationship between the ratio sigma(0)(HH)/sigma(0)(HV) and the soil moisture. The backscattering coefficient ratio between a low and it high incidence angle decreases with the rms surface height, and minimizes the effect of the soil moisture. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) with a suspended 1 GHz horn antenna was deployed for measurement of soil water contents and crop canopy properties over bare and electrically terminating surfaces. Surface reflection (SR) and signal propagation times (PT) were used to independently determine dielectric permittivity and water content of soil and canopy. Measured surface reflection coefficients progressively decreased with increasing canopy biomass according to Beer-Lambert type relationships. In contrast, PT measurements remained unaffected by canopy, and hence provided an accurate account of soil water content dynamics. Immediately after canopy removal, SR-based soil water content measurements were in close agreement with PT values. Canopy dielectric properties were inferred from canopy water contents (epsilon(c-CWC)) and canopy propagation times (epsilon(c-CPT)). Distinct canopy reflections were correlated with key canopy biophysical parameters. The study demonstrates the usefulness of a horn antenna GPR for characterization of vegetation canopy scattering, and for subcanopy water content measurements within a well-defined footprint, thereby offering a potential for calibration and verification of radar data collected from air- and spaceborne platforms.

AB The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weekly snow cover dataset (1966-) is the longest available record of snow cover extent (SCE) over the Northern Hemisphere (NH). This dataset has been Used extensively to derive trends in continental SCE and in climate-related studies, but it has received only limited validation, particularly in high latitude areas of the NH. This study evaluated spring snow cover depletion in the NOAA daluset over a study area in the Canadian Arctic mainland north of the tree line. The evaluation used four sources of information: (1) surface snow depth and snow survey observations, (2) snow cover extent produced from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), (3) snow cover extent derived from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and (4) Landsat 5 TM browse images. Six spring seasons from the period 1981-2000 with low (1984, 1988, and 1998) and high (1985, 1995, and 1997) spring snow cover extent were evaluated. The evaluation revealed that the NOAA weekly dataset consistently overestimated snow cover extent during the spring melt period, with delays of up to 4 weeks in melt onset. A number of possible reasons for this delay were investigated. The most likely causes for the delayed melt onset were frequent cloud cover in the spring melt period, and the low frequency of data coverage over higher latitudes. The results suggest that caution should be exercised when using this dataset in any studies related to the timing of snowmelt in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Microwave-based remote sensing algorithms for mapping soil moisture are sensitive to water contained in surface vegetation at moderate levels of canopy cover. Correction schemes require spatially distributed estimates of vegetation water content at scales comparable to that of the microwave sensor footprint (10(1) to 10(4) in). This study compares the relative utility of high-resolution (1.5 in) aircraft and coarser-resolution (30 in) Landsat imagery in upscaling an extensive set of ground-based measurements of canopy biophysical properties collected during the Soil Moisture Experiment of 2002 (SMEX02) within the Walnut Creek Watershed. The upscaling was accomplished using expolinear relationships developed between spectral vegetation indices and measurements of leaf area index, canopy height, and vegetation water content. Of the various indices examined, a Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), derived from near- and shortwave-infrared reflectances, was found to be least susceptible to saturation at high levels of leaf area index. With the aircraft data set, which did not include a short-wave infrared water absorption band, the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) yielded best correlations with observations and highest saturation levels. At the observation scale (10 in), LAI was retrieved from both NDWI and OSAVI imagery with an accuracy of 0.6, vegetation water content at 0.7 kg m(-2), and canopy height to within 0.2 in. Both indices were used to estimate field-scale mean canopy properties and variability for each of the intensive soil-moisture-sampling sites within the watershed study area. Results regarding scale invariance over the SMEX02 study area in transformations from band reflectance and vegetation indices to canopy biophysical properties are also presented.

AB This paper presents a method to automatically classify segmented tree crowns from high spatial resolution colour infrared aerial images as one of the four most common tree species in Sweden. The species are Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), birch (Betula pubescens Ehrh.), and aspen (Populus tremida L.). The proposed method uses four different image measures, one measure for each species. The measures are based on colour information as well as the shape of the segmented tree crowns. A segment is examined by the measures one by one and if one measure becomes true, the segment is interpreted as that species. The analysis continues with the next segment. The method is evaluated on two sets of images. The first set consists of 14 images of naturally regenerated forest with pixel size corresponding to 3 cm. These images contain approximately 50 visible tree crowns each; a total of 791 crown segments are used. The overall classification result for these images is 77%. If only the distinction between conifers and deciduous is made, the result is 91%. The second set consists of two images with a pixel size of 10 cm. Here, the overall classification result is 71%.

AB The detection of changes affecting continental surfaces has important applications in hydrological, meteorological, and climatic modeling. We propose a way to improve mono-index change detection by a fusion of multi-index change detection results. This fusion is performed in the framework of the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, which is particularly suited to the representation of imprecision and ignorance at the "no change"/" change" class border. Depending on the change detection index considered, we also need to determine the class number and features. This is done using the a contrario theory approach rather than classical statistical tests. The proposed algorithm is applied to forest fire damage evaluation based on three popular change indices: normalized difference values, texture evolution, and mutual information (MI). We find that change index fusion is effective at reducing both false alarm and misdetection levels, due to the complementary nature of these indices. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Meso-scale digital terrain models (DTMs) and canopy-height estimates, or digital canopy models (DCMs), are two lidar products that have immense potential for research in tropical rain forest (TRF) ecology and management. In this study, we used a small-footprint lidar sensor (airborne laser scanner, ALS) to estimate sub-canopy elevation and canopy height in an evergreen tropical rain forest. A fully automated, local-minima algorithm was developed to separate lidar ground returns from overlying vegetation returns. We then assessed inverse distance weighted (IDW) and ordinary kriging (OK) geostatistical techniques for the interpolation of a sub-canopy DTM. OK was determined to be a superior interpolation scheme because it smoothed fine-scale variance created by spurious understory heights in the ground-point dataset. The final DTM had a linear correlation of 1.00 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.29 m when compared against 3859 well-distributed ground-survey points. In old-growth forests, RMS error on steep slopes was 0.67 m greater than on flat slopes. On flatter slopes, variation in vegetation complexity associated with land use caused highly significant differences in DTM error distribution across the landscape. The highest DTM accuracy observed in this study was 0.58-m RMSE, under flat, open-canopy areas with relatively smooth surfaces. Lidar ground retrieval was complicated by dense, multi-layered evergreen canopy in old-growth forests, causing DTM overestimation that increased RMS error to 1.95 m.
   A DCM was calculated from the original lidar surface and the interpolated DTM. Individual and plot-scale heights were estimated from DCM metrics and compared to field data measured using similar spatial supports and metrics. For old-growth forest emergent trees and isolated pasture trees greater than 20 m tall, individual tree heights were underestimated and had 3.67- and 2.33-m mean absolute error (MAE), respectively. Linear-regression models explained 51% (4.15-m RMSE) and 95% (2.41-m RMSE) of the variance, respectively. It was determined that improved elevation and field-height estimation in pastures explained why individual pasture trees could be estimated more accurately than old-growth trees. Mean height of tree stems in 32 young agroforestry plantation plots (0.38 to 18.53 in tall) was estimated with a mean absolute error of 0.90 m (r(2) = 0.97; 1.08-m model RMSE) using the mean of lidar returns in the plot. As in other small-footprint lidar studies, plot mean height was underestimated; however, our plot-scale results have stronger linear models for tropical, leaf-on hardwood trees than has been previously reported for temperate-zone conifer and deciduous hardwoods.

AB Management of crop residues is an important consideration for reducing soil erosion and increasing soil organic carbon. Current methods of measuring residue cover are inadequate for characterizing the spatial variability of residue cover over large fields. The objectives of this research were to determine the spectral reflectance of crop residues and soils and to assess the limits of discrimination that can be expected in mixed scenes. Spectral reflectances of dry and wet crop residues plus three diverse soils were measured over the 400-2400 nm wavelength region. Reflectance values for scenes with varying proportions of crop residues and soils were simulated. Additional spectra of scenes with mixtures of crop residues, green vegetation, and soil were also acquired in corn, soybean, and wheat fields with different tillage treatments. The spectra of dry crop residues displayed a broad absorption feature near 2100 nm, associated with cellulose-lignin, that was absent in spectra of soils. Crop residue cover was linearly related (r(2) = 0.89) to the Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI), which was defined as the relative depth of this absorption feature. Green vegetation cover in the scene attenuated CAI, but was linearly related to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, r(2) = 0.93). A novel method is proposed to assess soil tillage intensity classes using CAI and NDVI. Regional surveys of soil conservation practices that affect soil carbon dynamics may be feasible using advanced multispectral or hyperspectral imaging systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB The LBA-ECO program is one of several international research components under the Brazilian-led Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). The field-oriented research activities of this study are organized along transects and include a set of primary field sites, where the major objective is to study land-use change and ecosystem dynamics, and a smaller set of 15 operational eddy flux tower sites, where the major objective is to quantify net exchange Of CO2 with the atmosphere. To supplement these studies and help to address issues of fine-scale spatial heterogeneity and scaling, high-resolution satellite imagery (IKONOS, 1-4 m) have been acquired over some of these study sites. This paper begins with a description of the acquisition strategy and IKONOS holdings for LBA. This section is followed with a review of some of the most promising new applications of these data in LBA. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we present an operational procedure for the inversion of kernel-driven bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model and further albedo retrieval to be applicable to the SEVIRI/MSG reflectance measurements. Our approach aims at bringing solutions to an ill-posed problem that is when the ratio of extreme eigenvalues of the inverse matrix is of several orders of magnitude due to sparse and irregular angular samplings. The geometric Li-Sparse reciprocal and Roujean kernels are considered in the procedure applied to space-borne Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance (POLDER) sensor data which decomposes as follows: (1) quality control, (2) accumulation of a priori information on model coefficients of directional hemispherical reflectance, and (3) implementation of BRDF model inversion methods based on the biased estimation instead of usual nonbiased least solution due to its large variance. The first two steps are detailed in this paper; the third one appears in a companion paper. The data control procedure consists both in filtering inputs of reflectance data and output of model coefficients. In the first stage, the analysis criteria rely on Fisher statistics. In the second stage, a procedure is applied to red and near-infrared POLDER data corresponding to the 16 classes of International Geosphere Biosphere Program (IGBP) land cover classification. Among the retained criteria, some are based on the BRDF shape. They encompass (1) T-statistics, (2) the bowl shape index (BSI), (3) the dome shape index (DSI), (4) the white sky albedo (WSA, bi-hemispherical reflectance), and (5) the black sky albedo variance (BSA, directional-hemispherical reflectance). Statistical results include mean values and covariance matrix for the spectral BRDF model coefficients. This procedure eliminates about 10% of data measurements, thereby reducing uncertainty in retrieved BRDF model coefficients and WSA. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the United States, there is widespread concern about understanding and curbing urban sprawl, which has been cited for its negative impacts on natural resources, economic health, and community character. There is not, however, a universally accepted definition of urban sprawl. It has been described using quantitative measures, qualitative terms, attitudinal explanations, and landscape patterns. To help local, regional and state land use planners better understand and address the issues attributed to sprawl, researchers at NASA's Northeast Regional Earth Science Applications Center (RESAC) at The University of Connecticut have developed an urban growth model. The model, which is based on land cover derived from remotely sensed satellite imagery, determines the geographic extent, patterns, and classes of urban growth over time.
   Input data to the urban growth model consist of two dates of satellite-derived land cover data that are converted, based on user-defined reclassification options, to just three classes: developed, non-developed, and water. The model identifies three classes of undeveloped land as well as developed land for both dates based on neighborhood information. These two images are used to create a change map that provides more detail than a traditional change analysis by utilizing the classes of non-developed land and including contextual information. The change map becomes the input for the urban growth analysis where five classes of growth are identified: infill, expansion, isolated, linear branch, and clustered branch.
   The output urban growth map is a powerful visual and quantitative assessment of the kinds of urban growth that have occurred across a landscape. Urban growth further can be characterized using a temporal sequence of urban growth maps to illustrate urban growth dynamics. Beyond analysis, the ability of remote sensing-based information to show changes to a community's landscape, at different geographic scales and over time, is a new and unique resource for local land use decision makers as they plan the future of their communities.

AB This paper describes a methodology of using data acquired by the European Meteosat and the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) geostationary satellites to detect burned areas in different tropical environments. The methodology is based on a multiple threshold approach applied to the thermal radiance and to a spectral index specific for burned surfaces. The Simple Index for Burned Areas (SIBA), also developed in this study, makes use of the information contained in the visible and thermal InfraRed (IR) band available on the geostationary satellites, whose main advantages are the high temporal resolution and the minimal level of pre-processing required. The results obtained with Meteosat data have been evaluated comparing them with NOAA-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data acquired over the Central Africa forest-savannah areas. For GMS imagery, AVHRR data acquired over the woodland-savannah areas of Northern Territory in Australia have been used. Despite the very low spatial and spectral resolution of the data, accuracy assessment showed at a regional and continental scale the resulting burned area maps could be a valuable source of information for the monitoring of the fire activity and for the assessment of fire impact on tropospheric chemistry.

AB The natural tropical rain forest is an irregular mosaic of ever-changing developmental phases of vegetation. Its structure is a key information for forest monitoring and sustainable management. This experimental study aims to improve the understanding of the relationships between the forest structure and the anisotropic behaviour of the remotely sensed forest reflectance. It relics on intensive field-based measurements and synchronous remote sensing data collection. Three different tropical rain forests have been observed using six different SPOT-HRVIR images. Texture information is related to forest structure by means of geostatistical analysis based on directional variograms for the NIR channel. The results demonstrate a strong interaction between the elements contributing to the forest structure, i.e. the tree crowns and the gaps, and the viewing and illumination conditions of each observation. The concept of the Bi-directional Standard deviation Distribution Function (BSDF) is introduced to discriminate the forest structures. A simple geometric-optical gap model explains more than 80% of the variability of the NIR reflectance standard deviation. Finally, a cross-thresholding approach using the NIR reflectance and the Local Directional Contrast (LDC) is proposed and successfully applied to discriminate the canopy roughness of the different forest sites.

AB Our principal objectives were to examine the application of a time-series of advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data to contrast the inundation regimes of a range of large, climatically sensitive playas in the Zone of Chotts regions of southern Tunisia and northeastern Algeria. In doing so, we aimed to: (i) refine methods for monitoring monthly changes in lake areas and seasonal water balance, building from previous studies; (ii) explore the extent to which simple hydrological models can be developed for individual playas; and (iii) compare the hydrologic response of individual playas to seasonal rainfall inputs within North Africa. Here, analyses were conducted using two time-series of AVHRR data (c.2 images per month) for southern Tunisia and northern Algeria (1983-1993 and 1987-1999), with coincident meteorological data. These data were used to detect and monitor inundation events within specific playa catchments in the Zone of Chotts region. Key analyses methods included: (a) the use of reflectance profiles for each time-series to infer inundation processes for each playa and (b) the extraction of lake areas from sequential image data to determine the extent of inundation with an accuracy of between 2% and 6% (depending on lake size). For those playas which were found to inundate as a direct result of precipitation records of lake area change were used to drive simple hydrological models to allowed mean monthly precipitation (P), monthly effective precipitation (P-E), and monthly evaporation (E) to be estimated. The techniques presented here make an important contribution to our understanding of the hydrology of playas in this region. Results for individual playas also suggest that these techniques may be useful in highlighting the dynamic response of these environments to the forcing mechanisms for regional precipitation (e.g., North Atlantic Oscillation [NAO]). In addition, the findings suggest that more widespread monitoring of playa inundation processes in this manner may impact on our understanding of the precipitation/evaporation status of a number of dryland regions.

AB In this study, we explored the potential of multi-temporal SPOT-4 VEGETATION (VGT) sensor data for characterization of temperate and boreal forests in Northeastern China. As the VGT sensor has a short-wave infrared (SWIR) band that is sensitive to vegetation, soil moisture and leaf water content, the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was calculated in addition to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). A forest map of Northeast China was generated from an unsupervised classification of 25 10-day VGT composite data (NDVI and NDWI) over the period of March 11-20, 1999 to November 11-20, 1999. Seven different forest categories were distinguished from the 1-km spatial resolution VGT data. The VGT forest map was compared to estimates of forest area derived from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) images. There was a good agreement on spatial distribution and area of forest between the VGT product and the TM product, however, the VGT product provided additional information on forest type. Analysis of NDVI and NDWI over the plant growing season allows for the identification of distinct growth patterns between the different forest types. It is evident that VGT data can be used to provide timely and detailed forest maps with limited ancillary data needed. The VGT-derived forest maps could be very useful as input to biogeochemical models (particularly carbon cycle models) that require timely estimates of forest area and type.

AB Higher spatial resolution in Earth-atmosphere models requires improved information on surface fields with very different thermal characteristics, such as land and water. Remote sensing is a useful tool for this purpose. A method is presented here to determine and compare the temperature evolution Of water bodies. Thermal IR observations were extracted from NOAA's advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data over the period from April I to August 31, 1994. The IR temperatures were calibrated and adjusted to account for the intervening atmosphere, For each day, 1-km resolution temperature scones were generated for a 1000 x 1000-km rectangular region extending from about 60degreesN, 111degreesW over the northern part of the Canadian Province of Alberta to about 500N, 97degreesW in southern Manitoba. There are 132 water bodies of area larger than 100 km(2) in this study area. The temperature cycle over these water bodies can be decomposed into a straight line with a small positive slope for spring ice break-up, followed by a fitted quadratic curve for the summer temperature variations. The curve fit parameters give information on the transition between ice and ice-free conditions. Data stratification confirms a strong latitudinal influence on the shape of the curves. It was not possible to quantify the effect of water depth. as the depth of most boreal lakes is not known. Instead, a list of fit coefficients for all the water bodies is provided. Once detrended from the quadratic curves, the amplitude of the diurnal cycle and major variations in temperatures of the water bodies can be determined. The detrended water temperature variations are about one-third the magnitude of the detrended air temperature variations from nearby weather stations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB One of the important issues of the Cloud parameter retrieval is how to optimize the improved observational capability of new, radiometers. In this study, we examined a neural network approach to retrieve simultaneously optical depth and effective radius of overcast bounded cascade clouds from high-resolution multiwavelength radiometric data. The high-resolution retrieval allows the assumption of uniform cloud parameters within the target pixel but also requires the integration of radiometric data of neighboring pixels as ancillary data because of the net horizontal transport of photons. The performance of the mapping neural network (MNN) high-resolution retrieval vas evaluated under conditions of vertical and oblique illumination using six pairs of, wavelengths with 0.64, 1.6. 2.2. and 3.7 mum. Two types of clouds are used: inhomogeneous clouds with horizontal uniform effective radius and inhomogeneous clouds with horizontally variable optical depth and effective radius. The results show that we can retrieve these cloud parameters with a reasonable accuracy, which varies with the spectral channels Used for the retrieval. The application of a "one-neuron" MNN for the cloud parameter retrieval shows that the effective radius estimation depends on visible wavelength when used with another having only a small absorption as 1.6 or 2.2 mum.

AB A method designed to Study the relative effects of the input parameters of any model has been investigated with canopy reflectance (CR) models. Traditionally. sensitivity analyses are performed by changing one input parameter at a time. Such an approach is limited because it lacks strategy. A promising alternative is in the use of design of experiments, a statistical method that allows defining a structured and restricted number of simulations for which all input parameters vary simultaneously. This approach is especially helpful in multidimensional parameter spaces. It is demonstrated using four 1 D radiative transfer models that are compared in direct mode. These models are combinations of the PROSPECT]ear optical properties model with the four CR models. SAIL (Scattering and Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves), KUUSK. IAPI, and NADI (New Advanced DIscrete model). The sensitivity studies were conducted in the visible/near-infrared on the following parameters: the leaf structure (N), the chlorophyll-a and -b content (C-ab), the leaf area index (LAI), the mean leaf inclination angle (theta (1)), the hot spot (s(1)), and the soil brightness (alpha (soil)). We compared simulated reflectances for a given set of measurement geometries and two wavebands of the POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances) spaceborne instrument. The relative effects of the biophysical parameters are assessed as well as their contribution to reflectance. allowing us to rank the most influential ones. Their interactions were also studied from the perspective of improving inversion procedures. Globally, the four models agree well in terms of computed reflectances and parameter effects, nevertheless with some discrepancies due to the implementation of different leaf angle distribution (LAD) functions.

AB Cloud cover usually denies the generation of land surface temperature (LST) time series over large areas from thermal infrared (TIR) data sensed by satellites. If cloud cover is brief(< 4 h) and only partial on the scale of a METEOSAT pixel, the discontinuous time series of cloud-free measurements still approximates a cloud-free diurnal temperature cycle (DTC). In order to interpolate the missing values and to describe the thermal behaviour of the land surface as a whole, advantage is taken of METEOSAT's high temporal resolution of 30 min. A Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation scheme is utilised to automatically fit a model of the DTC to the time series of cloud-screened brightness temperatures (BT). Out of physical considerations and in order to stabilise the fits, a priori knowledge from solar geometry is utilised and the model function is required to be smooth and continuous. A robust estimator of the error, which is based on the median rather than the arithmetic mean, is used to lessen the impact of outliers on the fits. The thermal behaviour of the land surface is then described by the determined model parameters, and the 48 METEOSAT BTs per pixel per day are reduced to five parameters per pixel per day. Monthly maximum and median composites of cloud-screened METEOSAT BTs yield synthetic DTCs, which are less influenced by synoptic effects. Fitting the model to monthly composites reduces the 17520 METEOSAT BTs per pixel per year to 60 parameters per pixel per year. This data reduction is advantageous to climatological studies, which require the processing of long time series. The model parameters are shown to be related to physical properties of the land surface, particularly to the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and thermal inertia.

AB A number of process models now exist that estimate carbon and water vapor exchange across a broad array of vegetation. Many of these models can be driven with information derived from satellite sensors. In particular, a large number use the normalized difference vegetation index to infer spatial and temporal shifts in the fraction of visible light intercepted (f phi (p,a.)) by vegetation. We utilized a simplified process model (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth from Satellites), initialized with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer normalized difference vegetation index-derived estimates of f phi (p,a.) to estimate at monthly time steps photosynthesis, respiration, and aboveground growth of forest vegetation within a 54,000 km(2) region in southwestern Oregon. We had data available from 755 permanent survey plots to provide an independent estimate of forest growth capacity. In addition. we took advantage of a satellite-derived classification of 14 major forest types to investigate the extent that generalizations might be made about their respective productive capacities. From weather stations and statewide soil surveys. we extrapolated and transformed these sources of data into those required to drive the model (solar radiation, temperature extremes. vapor pressure deficit, and precipitation) and initialize conditions (soil water holding capacity and soil fertility). Within the mountainous region we found considerable variation existed within each 1-km(2) pixel centered on each of the survey plots. Even by excluding comparisons where local variation was high, model predictions of forest growth compared poorly with those estimated from ground survey (r(2) = 0.4). This variation was only partly attributed to variation in canopy f phi (p,a). Local variation in climate and soils played an equal if not greater role. When the sample plots were stratified into 14 broad forest types. within which growth potential varied similarly (coefficient of variation for each of the 14 types averaged 6%), a good relation between predicted and measured forest growth capacity across all types resulted (r(2) = 0.82, P less than or equal to0.01, SE = 1.2 m(3) ha(-1) yr(-1)). The implications of these analyses suggest that: (1) models should be rigorously tested before applying across landscapes: (2) accuracy in locating plots and in extrapolating data limits spatial resolution; (3) soil surveys in mountainous regions are inaccurate and difficult to interpret, (4) mapped vegetation classifications provide a useful level of stratification; and (5) remotely sensed estimates of canopy nitrogen status and biomass increment and canopy nitrogen status are needed to improve and validate regional assessment of growth.

AB Linear regression procedures can be applied to derive spectral endmembers using satellite images and superimposed abundance estimates of known components. A common problem, however, is represented by the spatial variability of the spectral endmembers to estimate, which may be caused by variations in several environmental factors (topography, water availability, soil type, etc.). This problem is currently addressed by a modified multivariate regression procedure than can define spatially variable spectral endmembers. The procedure is based on a local calibration of the regression statistics (mean vectors and variance/covariance matrices), which is obtained by weighting the values of the training pixels according to their distance from each pixel examined. The locally found regression statistics are then used to extrapolate pure class spectral endmembers, which are therefore different for each image pixel. An experiment was carried out using multitemporal NOAA-AVHRR NDVI profiles and class abundance estimates of Tuscany region in central Italy. The results show that the spatially variable spectral endmembers are far more accurate than conventional fixed endmembers to recompose the original NDVI imagery. Finally, it is discussed how these spatially variable pure class NDVI values can serve for data integration and as input for agro-meteorological applications and ecosystem simulation modeling.

ID CONTEXTUAL CLASSIFICATION; CROSS-VALIDATION; NEURAL-NETWORK
AB This article discusses two new methods for increasing the accuracy of classifiers used land cover mapping. The first method, called the product rule, is a simple and general method of combining two or more classification rules as a single rule. Stacked regression methods of combining classification rules are discussed and compared to the product rule. The second method of increasing classifier accuracy is a simple nonparametric classifier that uses spatial information for classification. Two data sets used for land cover mapping of Landsat TM scenes from Idaho and Montana illustrate the new methods. For these examples, the product rule compared favorably to the more complex stacked regression methods. The spatial classifier produced substantial increases in estimated accuracy when combined with one or more additional classifiers that used remotely sensed variables for classification. These results suggest that the product rule may produce increases in map accuracy with little additional expense or effort. The spatial classifier may be useful for increasing accuracy when patterns exist in the spatial distribution of land cover. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB The phase coherence between repeat-pass SAR observations of a tropical forest region was investigated as a source of information for biophysical characteristics in regenerating and undisturbed areas of forest. SAR imagery was acquired and interferometric coherence maps were derived for a 1-day repeat pair at C-band, using ERS-1 and ERS-2, and for 44-day and 132-day repeats at L-band, using JERS. The backscattering coefficient and coherence characteristics were analyzed in conjunction with biomass density estimates determined from field measurements and land cover characteristics derived from an annual sequence of Landsat TM imagery. The results demonstrate that repeat-pass coherence adds significantly to the information available from SAR imagery of tropical forest. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

The SHOALS lidar system was recently augmented with the ability to utilize kinematic GPS (KGPS) with on-the-fly (OTF) phase ambiguity resolution to permit the system to be used more extensively over land and for shoreline and other topographic mapping, in addition to underwater bathymetry. The seamless integration of these capabilities permits continuous surveying across the land/water boundary. Importantly, this also permits the production of sea bottom and topographic elevations without the need for concurrently measured water-level data. Algorithms and procedures associated with the use of OTF KGPS are presented along with examples of performance. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB A three-component reflectance model that takes into account the contributions of dissolved organic matter, phytoplankton, and mineral particles is described. The principle of inversion of the model, in terms of chlorophyll a plus phaeopigments concentration, chl, sediment refractive index, m(r), and absorption coefficient of yellow substance at 440 nm, a(y)(440), is exposed. The inversion procedure is applied to experimental data collected in the Ebro river plume area. The obtained estimates of chl are accurate only in order of magnitude. However, we demonstrate the m(r) and a(y)(440) determinations are robust against chl variations within -50%, +100% of experimental values. Investigation of possible variations with wavelength of m(r), using measured concentrations and a(y)(440) estimates, evidences a slight dependency as was previously observed. We support in conclusion that the inversion procedure could be exploited in a two-step process. First a(y)(440) and the mean value of m(r) are estimated from measured water quality parameters. The m(r) is calculated at each wavelength considering a(y)(440) value determined in the first step. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB This study focuses on the use of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) and the Canadian RADAR,FAT satellite to monitor retreating glaciers, specifically the Columbia Glacier, and the hazards caused by their recession on a routine basis. The Columbia Glacier is an important tidewater glacier to monitor because of its present rapid retreat, its generation of icebergs, and its vicinity to oil-tanker traffic in and out of the Port of Valdez, Alaska. We have established routine monitoring of the Prince William Sound area using SAR aboard the Canadian RADARSAT on a semi-weekly basis. To demonstrate the use of this data, four ERS-1 and seven RADARSAT SAR images from 1992 to 1998 are used in this study eo monitor the long-term retreat of the Columbia Glacier A loss of 17.7 +/- 0.2 square Kilometers is measured from 1992 to 1997, with 38.4% of this change occurring from 1993 to 1994. Also, hazards such as icebergs are monitored in near real-time. SAR is an efficient and cost-effective means of monitoring glaciers, where cloud cover and logistical costs and difficulties hamper other data-collection efforts. These data are available to U.S. Government users and would be of benefit to the Prince William Sound region if used operationally. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB A primary objective of the Earth Observing System (EOS) is to develop and validate algorithms to estimate leaf area index (L), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(APAR)) and net primary production (NPP) from remotely sensed products. These three products are important because they relate to or are components of the metabolism of the biosphere and can be determined for terrestrial ecosystems from satellite-borne sensors. The importance of these products in the EOS program necessitates the need to use standard methods to obtain accurate ground truth estimates of L, f(APAR), and NPP that are correlated to satellite-derived estimates. The objective of this article is to review; direct and indirect methods used to estimate L, f(APAR) and NPP in terrestrial ecosystems. Direct estimates of L, biomass, and NPP can be obtained by harvesting individual plants, developing allometric equations, and applying these equations to all individuals in the stand. Using non-site-specific allometric equations to estimate L and foliage production can cause large errors because carbon allocation to foliage is influenced by numerous environmental and ecological factors. All of the optical instruments that indirectly estimate L actually estimate "effective" leaf area index (L-E) and underestimate L when foliage in the canopy is non-randomly distributed (i.e., clumped). We discuss several methods, ranging from simple to complex in terms of data needs, that can be used to correct estimates of L when foliage is clumped. Direct estimates of above ground and below-ground net primary production (NPPA and NPPB, respectively) are laborious, expensive and can only be carried out for small plots, yet there is a great need to obtain global estimates of NPP. Process models, driven by remotely sensed input parameters, are useful tools to examine the influence of global change on the metabolism of terrestrial ecosystems, but an incomplete understanding of carbon allocation continues to hamper development of more accurate NPP models. We summarize cal-bon allocation patterns for major terrestrial biomes and discuss emerging allocation patterns that can be incorporated into global NPP models. One common process model, light use efficiency or epsilon model, uses remotely sensed f(APAR), light use efficiency (LUE) and carbon allocation coefficients, and other meteorological data to estimates NPP. Such models require reliable estimates of LUE. We summarize the literature and provide LUE coefficients for the major biomes, being careful to correct for inconsistencies in radiation dry matter and carbon allocation tl nits.

AB This investigation tests the inversion of a geometric-optical forest reflectance model and the utility of two spectral indices (NDVI and SAVI) for estimating crown cover in a conifer forest site, using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral data. Emphasis was placed on incorporating the effects of variations in the background signatures into the inversion process. The inversion methodology and the sources of error were tested using simulated reflectance data. One-parameter inversions using constant background signatures could not retrieve stand cover because a significant proportion of the total variance in the spectral data resulted from background variations. The spectral indices performed better than the one-parameter inversions because the indices partially reduced background effects, but could not provide estimates of cover. When the background signatures were varied in three- and four-parameter inversions, inversion performed better than the spectral indices, giving estimates of cover for the test stands. The biophysical basis of the results are examined. The results indicate that variations in the background signatures can be included in the inversion in certain situations, and should be included when these effects are important. Inversion may provide a more robust method for estimating forest characteristics from multispectral satellite data; however, further testing is needed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB A comparison of time-resolved, laser-induced remote sensing and pulse amplitude modulation near-contact techniques has been carried out during photosynthetic induction in iron-deficient sugar beet leaves. Iron deficiency caused increases in the mean chlorophyll fluorescence lifetime. These increased chlorophyll fluorescence lifetimes occurred in dark-adapted leaves, during a sudden increase in light intensity and also at steady-state photosynthesis. Chlorophyll fluorescence lifetimes were correlated with the extent of nonphotochemical and/or photochemical quenching. During most of the photosynthetic induction period Fe-deficient leaves showed lower actual PSII efficiencies than control leaves, due to decreases in photochemical quenching and intrinsic PSII deficiency. During photosynthetic induction Fe deficiency decreased the proportion of light absorbed by the PSII antenna that is used in photochemistry and increased the proportion dissipated thermally within the PSII antenna, the later being well correlated with nonphotochemical quenching. Laser instrumentation offers new perspectives for monitoring effects of stress conditions in plants at large spatial scales. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB The numerical snow metamorphism model CROCUS derives a complete description of the snow cover according to ifs geographical location (range), elevation, slope, and orientation. From the remote sensing data, snow parameters that were comparable to the model results were derived: the lower elevation of the snare cover, the surface grain size, and the surface temperature. The Landsat Thematic Mapper sensor teas used because it has a good spatial resolution, a short wave infrared channel which is sensitive to grain size, and a thermal infrared channel. A first Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) scene was acquired on 24 April 1992 and a second one on II December 1992. A DEM (digital elevation model) was used to obtain the local incidence angles and the elevation of each snow pixel. The pixels were then grouped according to the CROCUS classification (range, elevation, slope, orientation), and the mean snore characteristics for each class were compared with the CROCUS results. The lower limit of snow and the surface grain size derived from TM data compared favorably with the model results even if those parameters were not always easy to define. Larger differences were found for the temperature because it caries rapidly and is very sensitive to shadowing by surrounding mountains and abo because ifs remote measurement is dependent on atmosphere conditions.

AB SLOP (stochastic model for leaf optical properties) is a revised version of the stochastic model for leaf optical properties. It calculates the reflection, transmission, and absorption of light by leaves in the spectral region from 400 nm up to 2.5 mu m. The model treats the radiative transfer of diffuse light as transitions of light with weighted probabilities according to the theory of homogeneous Markov chains. The leaves are divided in several compartments analogous to the well-known leaf structure. As the specific absorption coefficients of chlorophylls are one of the main parameters of the model, special attention has been paid to derive the specific absorption spectra of chlorophyll: a and b in vivo. A com parison of modeled with measured leaf spectra from the LOPEX campaign shows good agreement. With this model also, the reflectance both of the zipper and lo rc;er side of a dicotyledon leaf was calculated rc;with the sa same parameters, demonstrating the typical differences observed by measurements.

AB A progressive two-class decision classifier (pTCDC) ir presented in this article. This multilayer procedure converts a multiclass classification problem into a several independent two-class separations. It not only provides the general advantages of hierarchical classification schemes over single-stage classification but it is also free of the need for hierarchical structure design and offers an optimal class pair discrimination environment. At each decision node, only one class pair is considered. Data processing aimed at maximising individual class pair separations, such as feature selection, classification algorithm selection and data source selection or data transformation, be comes more reliable and efficient. Experiments carried out using an AVIRIS data set are presented and the results demonstrate that fewer features are needed and classification accuracy is improved with the new procedure compared with single-stage classification.

AB A field experiment determined the reflectance wavebands and indices which corresponded most strongly with photosynthetic capacity in a mixed stand of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and slash pine (P. elliottii Engelm. var. elliottii). The 5-year-old pines ranged in height from 3 m to 6 m and formed an optically dense canopy. Variation in photosynthetic capacity was amplified by soil application of photosystem II herbicides diuron and bromacil to three of six experimental plots. Field measurements began on 23 August 1994 and continued through 20 December 1994. Canopy reflectance and leaf physiological data were acquired during mid to late morning for the sides of trees that generally received full sunlight. Net CO2 assimilation rate first regressed significantly with reflectance on 5 October at wavelengths near 700 nm. In the 5 October to 2 December period, assimilation rates approximated photosynthetic capacity. When data were combined over this period, the ration of reflectance at 701+/-2 nm with reflectance at 520+/-2 nm, or a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed from these values, regressed more strongly with photosynthetic capacity than first derivatives of spectral reflectance or wavelength at the read edge inflection point. The narrow band NDVI accounted for 17-29% more variability in the data than NDVI that were based on simulated TM, MSS, AVHRR, or SPOT bands. As a result of its linear relationship with assimilation rate, stomatal conductance to water vapor also regressed strongly with the narrow band ratio. These results are explained by the high sensitivity of reflectance near 700 nm to leaf chlorophyll content. The use of a narrow band centered near 700 nm along with a narrow or broad near infrared band in vegetation indices should provide increased accuracy in estimates of photosynthetic capacity and corresponding conductance for optically dense canopies. Evaluation of the influence of leaf area index on these relationships will require further study. Published by Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB The reflectance spectra of organic matter in the VIR-SWIR regions (400-2500 nm) were investigated with regard to possible changes that might occur during a biological decomposition process. Two different groups of organic matter were used in this study: a grape marc (CGM) and a separated cattle manure (CSM) that simulated pure organic matter endmembers in soils. Exposing the too materials for different decomposition durations (0-378 days) visually yielded color sequences as the compost aged. Significant changes in the reflectance spectra of both materials were also observed during the composting period, which provided parameters for controlling the composting process. The slopes In the VIS-NIR region were found to be basic parameters for monitoring changes and were found to be highly correlated with other chemical parameters often used for assessing organic matter conditions in the field (such as the C/N ratio). It was found that during the initial composting stage (0-60 days) the slope parameters were strongly affected by the decomposition activity and, hence, errors in the assess ment of organic matter content of soils. using Slope (or band ratio) parameters are likely. Careful observation of the major spectral features reveals that the reflectance spectrum in the VIS-NIR-SWIR region is a very sensitive tool for monitoring slight changes. Application of the near-infrared analysis (NIRA) pathways revealed that OH and C-H groups combined with hygroscopic water starch, cellullose, and lignin are the components having the highest correlations with composting time within the conditions used. Because of the small number of samples in each testing group a complete NIRA employing validation tests could not be carried out. We conducted that the reflectance spectrum in the VIS-NIR-SWIR region is a promising tool for monitoring the composting process and that the composting process may provide invaluable spectral information about soil organic matter during its biochemical degradation.

ID SAR
AB The full pattern for a large antenna is usually not wen known because of the difficulty in measuring it on a range. For spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the antenna may also be subjected to different gravitational stresses and temperature gradients that might deform ifs structure, so it is very likely that its pattern will be different from that on the ground. Moreover loss of elements on a distributed array can distort its pattern. In these cases, one can extract the relative vertical antenna pattern from the SAR images of target areas that are uniform, on average. In this report, images taken from the Amazon rain-forest region are analyzed to yield an estimate of the inflight relative-gain vertical antenna pattern for the SIR-C. The method is the same as that used with SIR-B (Moore and Hemmat, 1988), with X-SAR (Fang and Moore, 1995), and for scatterometer antennas on Seasat. Here we give the SIR-C vertical (elevation) antenna patterns for different incident angles and beam spoiling modes over a range of 6 dB for SIR-C. Because only a few of the antenna modes were used over the Amazon, these patterns are only representative. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB At the behest of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth, the National Research Council recently conducted a review on the current status and future directions for earth science information provided by spaceborne synthetic aperture radars. As part of this process, a panel of 16 scientists met to review the utility of SAR for monitoring ecosystem processes. The consensus of this ecology panel was that the demonstrated capabilities of imaging radars for investigating terrestrial ecosystems could best be organized into four broad categories: 1) classification and detection of change in land cover; 2) estimation of woody plant biomass 3) monitoring the extent and timing of inundation; and 4) monitoring other temporally-dynamic processes. The major conclusions from this panel were: 1) Multichannel radar data provide a means to classify land-cover patterns because of its sensitivity to variations in vegetation structure and vegetation and ground-layer moisture. The relative utility of data from imaging radars versus multispectral scanner data has yet to be determined in a rigorous fashion over a wide range of biomes for this application. 2) Imaging radars having the capability to monitor variations in biomass in forested ecosystems. This capability is not consistent among different forest types. The upper levels of sensitivity for L-band and C-band systems such as SIR-C range between <100 t ha(-1) for complex tropical forest canopies to similar to 250 t ha(-1) for simpler forests dominated by a single tree species. Best performance for biomass estimation is achieved using lower frequency (P- and L-band) radar systems with a cross-polarized (HV or VH) channel. 3) Like-polarized imaging radars (HH or VV) are well suited for detection of flooding under vegetation canopies. Lower frequency radars (P- and L-band) are most optimal for detecting flooding under forests, whereas higher frequency radars (C-band) work best for wetlands dominated by herbaceous vegetation. 4) It has been shown that spaceborne radars that have been in continuous operation for several years [such as the C-band (VV) ERS-1 SAR] provide information on temporally dynamic processes, such as monitoring a) variations in flooding in nonwooded wetlands, b) changes in the frozen/thawed status of vegetation, and c) relative variations in soil moisture in areas with low amounts of vegetation cover. These observations have been shown to be particularly important in studying ecosystems in high northern latitudes. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID AFRICAN SAVANNA TREES; RADIOMETER MEASUREMENTS
AB We analyzed the effect on the visible and near-infrared reflectance of shadows cast by a building, a conifer, and a hardwood on three different surfaces (grass, bare soil, and asphalt). Ground-measured radiances were collected with a radiometer measuring the SPOT-HRV bands and with a spectroradiometer measuring in the SPOT-HRV and LANDSAT-TM bands as well as giving the whole spectrum from 400 nm to 900 nm. We considered two types of reflectances: the ''sunlit reflectance'' and the ''shadow reflectance,'' which is calculated, using as irradiance, the radiance of the sunlit reference panel and of the shadowed reference panel, respectively. An analysis of variance showed that visible and near-infrared reflectances of shadows are significantly affected by the surface type and the shadow type. F-test values are higher for sunlit reflectances than for shadow reflectances as well as for near-infrared reflectances than for visible reflectances. Reflectances of hardwood shadows are generally higher and more variable than the ones of conifer shadows. Building shadows generally have lower reflectances than hardwood shadows and similar reflectances as conifer shadows. These reflectances were used to calculated two vegetation indices (NDVI and ARVI). They are also affected by the surface and shadow types. Whatever the object casting the shadows, spectra measured in the shadow are typical of the surface type (grass, bare soil, or asphalt). Further studies are needed on multiple shadows and penumbra effects, which are particularly important in the case of forest canopies. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996.

AB Remote sensing has generally been usual to study the role of tropical forests as a source of atmospheric carbon, primarily through land-use change, such as deforestation, and biomass burning. Regeneration of forest on previously cleared areas, however is a significant carbon sink. The strength of this carbon sink is dependent on the age and composition of the regenerating forest. The ability to identify regenerating forest classes that may differ in terms of carbon sink strength was investigated with Landsat TBI data of a test site near Manaus, Brazil. A number of forest age classes were defined from a time series of Landsat sensor data, and their separability in Landsat TM data was assessed by maximum likelihood classifications. A high level of class separability was observed with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.8569 obtained for a classification of six forest regeneration classes. Of the classification errors observed most were found to be associated with the youngest forest age class. At the test site, however, two main successional pathways were followed and the differences between areas of forest of the same age but on different pathways was most apparent with the youngest forests. Splitting the regenerating forests by the successional pathway was found to increase classifications accuracy, with a weighted kappa coefficient of 0.9315 observed for an 11 class classification. A range of tropical forest classes that vary in strength as a carbon sink could therefore be identified accurately from Landsat TM data. Although the broader generality of the results requires further investigation this indicates the potential to use image classifications to scale-up point measurements of the carbon flux between regenerating forest classes and the atmosphere over large areas.

AB Accurate cloud detection, in Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data over land is a difficult task complicated by spatially and temporally varying land surface reflectances and emissivities. The AVHRR Split-and-Merge Clustering (ASMC) algorithm for cloud detection in AVHRR scenes over land provides a computationally efficient, scene-specific, objective way to circumvent these difficulties. The algorithm consists of two steps: 1) a split-and-merge clustering of the input data (calibrated channel 2 albedo, calibrated channel 4 temperature, and a channel 3 - channel 4 temperature difference), which segments the scene into its natural groupings; and 2) a cluster-labelling procedure that uses scene-specific, joint three-dimensional adaptive labelling thresholds (as opposed to constant static thresholds) to label the clusters as either cloud, cloud-free land, or uncertain. The uncertain class is used for those pixels whose signature is not clearly cloud-free land or cloud (e.g., pixels at cloud boundaries that often contain subpixel cloud and land information that has been averaged together by the integrating grating aperture function of the AVHRR instrument). Results show that the ASMC algorithm is neither regionally nor temporally specific and can be used over a large range of solar altitudes. Sensitivity of the segmentation and labelling steps to the choice of input variables also was studied. Results obtained with the ASMC algorithm also compare favorably with those obtained from a wide range of currently used algorithms to detect cloud over land in AVHRR data. Moreov;er, the ASMC algorithm can be adapted for use with data to be taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer-Nadir (MODIS-N).

AB A geomorphological approach was applied to delineate environmental terrains in the study area, using a Geographic Information System. Such units were used as main spatial framework to search the land use suitability for landscape sets. A hierarchical structure was developed using ecological considerations with broad to specific scales. Thirty-two landscapes were delineated. The use of GIS for collecting, storing, and processing the spatial database was useful to interpret and determine the boundaries of environmental units, particularly in the interactive process of on-screen digitizing. In this process different thematic information layers were selected and overlaid on the hillshading map generated from a digital terrain model. The landscape units map was cross-tabulated against several thematic maps to obtain a database that describes area and cover percentage of each thematic class for each landscape. The landscape units map and its database led, in further phases, to our interpreting land use suitabilities related to an environmental land management approach.

AB A study ii as conducted to evaluated the radiometric performance of two commercially available diode-array field spectroradiometers: the Spectron Engineering (SE) Model 590 that has been on she market for some 10 years and the several-year-old Analytical Spectral Devices (ASD) Personal Spectrometer (PS) 2. Both of these instruments provide rapid acquisition (similar to 1 s) of a spectrum in the visible to near-infrared region (similar to 0.4-1.1 mu m) and are field-portable. These evaluations included: spectral bandwidth, second-order effects suppression, signal to noise ratios, noise equivalent radiances, linearity of response with radiance and with integration time, temperature sensitivity, and polarization sensitivity In the configurations tested the SE590 instruments had a spectral bandwidth of about 16 nm full width at half-maximum the PS2 instruments, 3-4 nm. Neither of the instruments produced measurable second-order leakage. When viewing a barium-sulfate-coated integrating source internally illuminated with tungsten lamps, both instruments were able to obtain signal to noise ratios of 1000:1 or better between 500 m and 900 nm over most of the dynamic range provided by the sources when the integration time was optimized for the light level. Signal to noise dropped at shorter wavelengths in part due to the low energy provided by the source and at longer wavelengths due to the decrease in the detector response. In linearity tests all of the instruments generally agreed within 5% of the reference radiometer between 400 nm and 1000 nm; however, results were poorer at lower radiance levels and at wavelengths longer than 1000 nm or shorter than 400 nm. Both of the instruments rely on a shutter to measure their dark current, which is normally subtracted from the signal. However, closing the shutter on all of the instruments altered the dark current readings to some extent such that the dark current that teas subtracted was not correct. When the error in dark current is compensated for, she apparent linearity of the system improves considerably with weak signals. The SE590 systems showed significant polarization sensitivity of up to 25%, whereas the PS2 instruments did not. Movement of the fiber optic cable on the PS2 instruments did result in measurable signal changes. Both instruments also showed the temperature sensitivity typical of silicon detectors; i.e., increasing sensitivity at the longer wavelengths with higher temperature.

In this region, brightness temperature depends on snow emissivity, which varies slowly over time, and on snow temperature, which varies more rapidly and is controlled by air temperature. The air temperature and brightness temperature data define an emissivity trend which can be modeled as an annual sinusoid. An air temperature trend can then be derived from the brightness temperature and modeled emissivity information. The estimated air temperature values represent an integrated near-surface value that defines the overall temperature trend at the Greenland Summit. The modeled emissivity cycle allows daily-average air temperatures to be estimated across significant gaps in weather station records, as well as quality control of their temperature data. The technique also generates annual trends of emissivity which can be used to evaluate radiative transfer models of microwave emissivity from dry firn.

AB We present a simple modification to the standard coastal zone color scanner (CZCS) atmospheric correction algorithm for application to Sea-viewing-wide-field-of-view-sensor (Sea WiFS). The modification reduces the error in the water-leaving reflectance using the standard algorithm by a factor of 2-6 when the aerosol behaves as predicted by the LOWTRAN-6 models. For many aerosol models likely to approximate aerosol properties over the oceans the error in the retrieved water-leaving reflectance is predicted to be less than or similar to +/- 0.002 at 443 nm for an aerosol load approximately 2 to 3 times that normally occurring in a maritime atmosphere. These errors in atmospheric correction lead to an error in the pigment concentration (C), retrieved using the blue-green ratio algorithm, of less than or similar to 50% for more than 75% of the aerosol models tested, whenever the algorithm retrieves a ''reasonable'' pigment concentration, and when 0.1 less than or equal to C less than or equal to 1 mg/m(3). This accuracy may be sufficient for some applications, for example, at-sea processing to guide ships to desirable sampling locations. An important feature of this algorithm is that, unlike more sophisticated and computational intensive algorithms, aerosol models are not required to effect the actual atmospheric correction. Investigators already having the CZCS algorithm implemented on an image processing system should be able to process Sea-WiFS imagery by making very simple modifications to the code.

AB In 1992 growers of high-value crops in central Wisconsin expressed an interest in using real-time remote sensing data for detecting crop stress. In response to this request, the Space Remote Sensing Center built a system based on work carried out by the USDA, ARS in Weslaco, Texas. This new system included a modification from analog to digital cameras that provided a means of overcoming previous barriers that inhibited real-time information delivery. These barriers include automated band to band registration, data calibration, and automated identification and retrieval of desired data frames. During the 1992 growing season weekly airborne acquisitions were attempted with 24-48-hr information delivery to the growers. Digital images were acquired for high value crops such as potatoes, sweet corn, cranberries, and peas. The system enabled detection of stresses such as freeze damage, irrigation problems, and Colorado potato beetle infestations. Experience gained during 1992 guided modification to the system to prepare for the 1993 growing season. This overall effort is helping prepare the market and technology for a real-time agriculture monitoring satellite.

DT Article
AB The microwave brightness temperatures over a frequency range from 1 GHz to 100 GHz were monitored below a large beech tree (Fagus silvatica L.) from August 1987 to August 1988, and several observations were added in the following 2 years until the beech was felled. The data were used to compute microwave transmissivities and opacities of the vegetation canopy. The results show that the transmissivities are influenced by wind, temperature, and liquid water, leaves play a dominant role, especially at frequencies above 5 GHz. With increasing frequency, also, the inhomogeneity of branches and leaves becomes more and more pronounced. An interesting result is the anticorrelation found between the microwave opacity of the test beech and a regional forest-damage parameter. These results are based on the full 4-year observation period. Potential applications of microwave radiometric tree observations are the study of the water status in vegetation, the estimation of forest-canopy parameters, and the development and the validation of microwave propagation models.

AB Numerous studies have noted a strong negative correlation between radiometric surface temperature and spectral vegetation indices such as the NDVI, and have suggested that this relationship might be exploited in strategies to model land surface energy balance from satellites. These studies have been largely empirical in nature and the relationships among remotely sensed data, land surface properties, and land surface energy balance that produce this phenomenon remain unclear. We studied the relationship between radiometric surface temperature and NDVI over a tallgrass prairie in northeastern Kansas. The study site included a mix of landcovers, with fractional vegetation cover and exposed soil backgrounds over much of the site. We observed a persistent negative correlation between radiometric surface temperature and NDVI, but found that the relationship was highly date- and time-specific. In this context, the relationship between surface temperature and NDVI was observed to depend on landcover type, and a significant proportion of the total variance in both NDVI and radiometric surface temperature was explained by stratifying the data by landcover class. More importantly, our results show the relationship between surface temperature and NDVI to have little association with surface energy balance for data sets acquired from aircraft and helicopters on several dates during the growing seasons of 1987 and 1989. Based on results from a simulation model of the soil-canopy-sensor system, we hypothesize the observed covariance between radiometric surface temperature and NDVI to be largely caused by temperature differences between the soil background and vegetation canopy and by variation in fractional vegetation cover. This hypothesis is supported by evidence showing soil moisture to be an important secondary control on radiometric surface temperature due to its effect on soil thermal inertia, rather than as a limiting control on latent heat flux, as might be expected. These findings indicate that invertible surface energy balance models must account for the effects of landcover, soil background temperatures, and soil moisture before thermal infrared imagery can be effectively used to estimate land surface fluxes.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation type are two ecological variables that influence atmosphere-biosphere exchange of CO2 and that can be estimated from remote sensing techniques. A forest ecosystem process model was used to examine the importance of LAI and species-dependent physiology when estimating photosynthesis in 21 black spruce, white spruce, quaking aspen, paper birch, and balsam poplar forests near Fairbanks, Alaska. Model sensitivity analyses for these 21 stands showed that uncertainty in LAI and species composition caused errors in net canopy assimilation of as much as 42-70% and 14-36%, respectively, depending on forest type. The sensitivity of net canopy assimilation to species-dependent physiology was greater between needleleaf coniferous and broadleaf deciduous life forms than among species within life forms. A simple regression model that recognized stand differences in LAI and life-form type (needleleaf coniferous, broadleaf deciduous) accounted for 94% of the variation in simulated net canopy assimilation for the 21 stands. Expanding the model to include species composition rather than life-form type only accounted for an additional 1% of the variation in simulated net canopy assimilation. The statistical model was applied to a synthetic aperture radar scene that discriminated black spruce, white spruce, balsam poplar, and alder forests in a 76.8 km2 region near Fairbanks. This analysis showed that regional net canopy assimilation was as sensitive to the area of each forest type as it was to the LAI of each forest type. The analyses reported in this article highlight the importance of recognizing physiological differences among needleleaf coniferous and broadleaf deciduous forest types when estimating regional net canopy assimilation in boreal forests.

TI AN ANALYTICAL MODEL FOR THE CLOUD-FREE ATMOSPHERE OCEAN SYSTEM

DT Article
AB An analytical model for the estimation of spectral and directional reflectance over the ocean is developed. The model accounts for the first and second orders of reflection at the ocean surface, and/or scattering by the atmosphere and the water column. The model parameters are the optical thickness and Angstrom exponent of aerosols, the spectral albedo of the ocean, and the directional specular reflectance of the ocean surface (glitter), the latter being a function of the wind speed and direction. We show that our analytical model is sufficient to predict all reflectance angular and spectral variations by comparing its results with a Monte Carlo simulation that accounts for the higher orders of scattering. Using this analytical model, actual bidirectional and spectral measurements are easily inverted in order to retrieve geophysical and optical parameters of the ocean-atmosphere system (the application to the data acquired by the Airborne POLDER is developed in a companion article).

AB Experimental and theoretical investigations have shown that microwave emission from canopies depends on crop type and physical conditions.  However, since the sensitivity of the brightness temperature to vegetation parameters is rather low, accurate observations and suitable models are necessary to extract geophysical parameters from radiometer data.  The most significant results, obtained over the past years on the basis of measurements carried out with passive microwave sensors at 10 GHz and 36 GHz, are summarized in this paper.  The relations between the microwave vegetation indexes and plant biophysical parameters are discussed, using a simple slab model that considers vegetation as a uniform absorbing and scattering medium upon the soil surface.  It is shown that simultaneous observations at 10 GHz and 36 GHz, in V and H polarizations, especially if combined with thermal infrared measurements, are useful in separating different crops and in identifying moisture conditions of the surfaces.  The difference (delta-T(N)), between the normalized temperatures at 36 GHz and 10 GHz, and the polarization index (PI) at 10 GHz are functions of biomass and can be related to the leaf area index of some crops.

AB Theoretical optical water quality models used in remote sensing require the specific absorption and specific backscattering spectra for each of the colored water components in order to model reflectance (R) or to use measured reflectance to find the component concentrations. The specific absorption and backscattering spectra for suspended minerals (SM), the specific absorption spectra for chlorophyll-a (C), and the absorption spectrum for water were determined solely from irradiance measurements collected simultaneously with the concentration of SM, C, and yellow substance (YS). The glacial SM in Chilko Lake have backscattering properties similar to SM found in Lake Ontario, but only about one-third the absorption. The absorption properties of C remain uncertain with two analysis techniques giving different results at shorter wavelengths and failing to find significant values at red wavelengths. The measured absorption of water closely matches reported laboratory results of Smith and Baker (1981). Tests showed that the calibrated R-model was slightly biased (less than 10%) with a standard deviation of +/- 6-16% depending on wavelength. When the model was used to solve for component concentrations, SM were found with a standard deviation of +/- 20%, C +/- 40%, and YS +/- 30%.

ID TRANSPORT-EQUATION; PLANT CANOPIES; REFLECTANCE
AB The physics of neutral particle interaction for photons traveling in media consisting of finite-dimensional scattering centers that cross-shade mutually is investigated.  A leaf canopy is a typical example of such media.  The leaf canopy is idealized example of such media.  The leaf canopy is idealized as a binary medium consisting of gaps (voids) and regions with phytoelements (turbid phytomedium).  Gaps through which photons travel unimpededly are assumed to be randomly distributed.  The mathematical approach for characterizing the structure of the host medium is considered in detail.  In this approach, the leaf canopy is represented by a combination of all possible open oriented spheres.  With rigorous definitions and notations, dependence of the extinction coefficient on the phase-space coordinates of the previous interaction center is shown to be a logical consequence.  Specifically, the extinction coefficient at any phase-space location in a leaf canopy is the product of the extinction coefficient in the turbid phytomedium and the probability of absence gaps at that location.  Using a similar approach, an expression for the differential scattering coefficient is derived.  Numerical results are presented to illustrate the influence of canopy parameters and direction of photon travel on the extinction coefficient.

ID EXPLORATION
AB Soybean plants were grown in hydroponic solutions having three concentration levels of phosphorus.  Spectral reflectance changes included higher reflectance in the green and yellow portions of the electromagnetic spectrum in phosphorus-deficient plants and a difference in position of the long wavelength edge (the red edge) of the chlorophyll absorption band centered near 0.68-mu-m.  Plants having the least phosphorus in the growing medium did not show the normal shift of the red edge to longer wavelength which occurs as leaves mature.  Shoot and root biomass were significantly lower in the phosphorus-deficient plants.  These results are consistent with those obtained when soybean plants are dosed with elevated concentrations of metallic elements.  We hypothesize that nutrient imbalances or anomalous metal concentrations in the soil set up physiological conditions at the soil / root interface that are responsible for the reflectance differences observed in laboratory and field studies of plants growing in substrates enriched in metallic elements.

For this purpose, a small tributary (Tawa) of a major river basin (Narmada Basin) in central India was studied for ground truth evaluation of digital data obtained from the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-1A Linear Imaging Self-Scanning (IRSIA-LISSI) sensor.  Tawa reservoir water samples were collected on 20 October 1988 concurrent with IRSIA overpass.  The samples were analyzed to determine the concentration of total suspended matter, grain size, and mineralogy.  The results indicate that, in the concentration range between 10 mg/L and 50 mg/L, a positive functional relationship exists between the concentration of suspended solids and the visible wavelength Bands 1, 2, and 3 (0.45-0.68-mu-m).  It has been observed that mineralogy and grain size are the main factors which influence the reflected radiance at lower concentration level (10-50mg/L) of suspended solids.  It can be concluded that as the concentration of suspended solids in the 10-50 mg/L range increases the spectral response increases.  It can be stated that IRSIA-LISSI data provide a good foundation for further development of remote sensing as a practical tool in the estimation of suspended solids.

ID SIMULATOR DATA; CLASSIFICATION; STATES
AB Landsat's Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery was used to evaluate its feasibility in differentiating among forest species and age groups of plantations to assist forest managers in planning and managerial operations.  The Catahoula and Kisatchie ranger districts of the Kisatchie National Forest were selected as the study site.  The Landsat imagery was evaluated on the basis of its spectral band combinations and spatial properties for differentiating among pine species, age groups, stocking rate, and hardwood acreage within the pine plantations.  The vector data utilized in the study included the transportation network, hydrography, and the compartment map of the districts.  The results revealed that TM imagery is inadequate for differentiating among pine species.  However, the differentiation among selected pine age groups was feasible using the band combination of TM Bands 5, 4, and 3.  High classification accuracies were achieved with most of the pine age classes for both forest districts.  Significant differences were found in differentiating among age groups between the two districts.  The 6-10, 11-20, and 21 plus age classes were the major contributors to the differences observed.  The small differences observed between the two TM band combinations (TM 5, 4, 3 and TM 5, 4, 3, 2) were not significant.  However, the combination of TM Bands 5, 4, and 3 is better based on the higher individual class accuracies and Kappa statistical values produced.

   SPECTRAL INDEXES WITH NDVI FOR HAPEX DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID HIGHLY CORRELATED IMAGES; COLOR ENHANCEMENT; SCANNER
AB The definition of temperature-independent thermal infrared spectral indices (TISI) is recalled and several examples of such indices based upon Channels 3, 4, 5 of the TIMS multispectral scanner are proposed.  The general procedure to obtain these indices is recalled and the particular indices TISI1 and TISI2 giving a larger weight to the spectral emissivities respectively in Channel 4 and in Channel 3 are discussed.  The correlations between TISI1 and other indices such as surface temperature T(s) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the NS001 scanner data acquired over two test sites during a HAPEXMOBILHY experiment are analyzed.  The results show that it is possible to use several TISIs amplifying different spectral channels to perform spectral analysis in the thermal infrared bands.  The pixels with low TISI1 and high surface temperature are generally bare soils while the pixels with high TISI1 and low surface temperature are vegetations or bare soils; this behavior is quite similar to that of NDVI(T(s)).  It turns out that, for the examples chosen and for bare soils, TISIs are better indicators of surface characteristics than NDVI, and therefore that TISIs are quite complementary to NDVI.

AB Monitoring plant phenology is vital to maintaining the global carbon balance and management under climate change. Bamboo forest is an essential forest type in subtropical China with a strong carbon sequestration capacity. In recent years, vegetation indices (VIs), which characterize canopy structural parameters, and solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), indicating the photosynthetic activity of vegetation, have provided new perspectives on plant phenology at regional and global scales. However, the best data sources and methods for extracting the phenology of bamboo forests remain to be explored. In this study, new vegetation indices were innovatively constructed by normalizing the VIs (enhanced vegetation index (EVI), two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), and near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv)) based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and SIF products (GOSIF) based on OCO-2 satellites and then taking the mean values of the normalized VIs (EVI, EVI2 and NIRv) and SIF. We called the new indices SVs (SIF and VIs combined indices, including Se (SIF and EVI combined index), Se2 (SIF and EVI2 combined index), or Sn (SIF and NIRv combined index)). Two time series reconstruction methods (asymmetric Gaussian (AG) function fitting and double logistic (DL) function) and two extractive phenology parameter methods (dynamic threshold method (DT) and comparative threshold method (CT)) were employed to extract phenological information. The advantages of SVs for extracting bamboo forest phenology (BFP) were verified by comparing the extraction performance of VIs, SIF, and SVs on the SOS and EOS of bamboo forests. Thus, the best way to extract BFP was explored, and the spatial distribution and spatial-temporal variation characteristics of BFP in China from 2011 to 2020 were analyzed. The results are described as follows: (1) SVs are better able to extract BFP parameters compared with VIs and SIF, especially in bamboo forest-specific off-years and on-years; (2) SIF has better accuracy than VIs in extracting BFP, where both SOS and EOS values obtained from VIs are overestimated, and SIF can reflect BFP information earlier; and (3) the best data sources for extracting SOS and EOS in bamboo forests are Sn and Se, respectively, and the optimal methods are AG_CT and DL_DT, respectively. Compared with SIF, the R2 values of Sn and Se extracted SOS and EOS are improved by 40.7% and 7.7%, and the RMSE values are reduced by 24.7% and 0.7%, respectively; and (4) the SOS for bamboo forests in China from 2011 to 2020 was mainly concentrated in 80-100 days, with an overall advancing trend; the EOS was mainly concentrated in 300-320 days, with an overall delay. The results show that the SVs obtained by coupling VIs and SIF can better track the BFP information, providing a practical reference for macroscopic monitoring of BFP based on medium resolution time series data.

AB Monitoring Antarctic icebergs helps us understand the interaction between ocean, atmosphere, and sea ice in the Southern Ocean. Although gigantic icebergs have been the objects of many remote sensing studies, medium icebergs in the Southern Ocean have been rarely monitored or traced. In this study, we develop an iceberg detection and tracking tool particularly for medium and large icebergs (0.4-10 km2), by using Python programming language and Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery, based on Google Earth Engine (GEE). To detect icebergs, we employ the simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC) and region adjacency graph (RAG) merging for object-based image segmentation and train/test the support vector machine (SVM) model with 6432 labeled segments of iceberg or non-icebergs from 40 images of S1 (2019-2021). Radar backscatter features and morphological features of those segments are used as the inputs of the SVM model. After icebergs are detected in two image scenes of different dates, we track the displacements of detected icebergs by comparing their 1-D shape signals. Our model shows -99% of accuracy in detecting icebergs and - 93-98% of accuracy in tracking icebergs depending on the day difference between image scenes. When using our tool for the monitoring of icebergs in the Amundsen Sea, we find that the iceberg fraction varies from 2% to 8% in 2021 and most of icebergs move westward with a speed of <0.2 km/day.

Although LiDAR scanning has the potential to reduce the intensive labor required to estimate fractal dimensions with manual measurements, neither an accuracy assessment comparing with true dimensions nor a guide or method for accurately measuring the dimensions using LiDAR scanners has been presented. This study examined the accuracy of fractal dimensions estimated using terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) and unmanned aerial LiDAR scanning (ULS) through computer simulations and developed an approach to reduce the estimation bias. The true fractal dimensions of digitized trees of red pine (Pinus densiflora), ubame oak (Quercus phillyreoides), and giant timber bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) in 18 site scenarios were calculated by applying the box-counting method to the tree object data. The true fractal dimensions were compared with the estimated dimensions in four TLS and ULS scenarios. Furthermore, a method to reduce the estimation bias was developed by introducing sequential point decimation and modeling the acquisition rate decay, thereby extrapolating the number of voxels before decay. Simple box-counting on highly dense and precise TLS data collected from four positions could retrieve the true fractal dimensions for all 18 site scenarios. However, sparse and less accurate TLS underestimated fractal dimensions in 8 out of 18 cases, and ULS overestimated the dimensions in 29 of 36 cases. The change in the relationship between the number of voxels and mesh size on a log-log plot with sequential decimation could be used to judge whether a set of TLS data can retrieve accurate fractal dimensions by applying simple box-counting to the TLS data. The developed method improved the estimations of fractal dimensions for 30 of the 37 cases where the simple box-counting on the TLS and ULS data provided biased estimations. In contrast, the estimation bias increased in 27 of the 35 cases where the simple box-counting on the TLS and ULS data successfully retrieved the true fractal dimensions.

AB Methane, as a crucial greenhouse gas, plays a significant role in global warming, contributing to approximately one-quarter of the observed climate change since pre-industrial times. Consequently, the detection and quantification of major methane emitters are vital in addressing this issue effectively. Satellite sensors with shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands provide valuable information for monitoring methane emissions. For example, Sentinel-2 multispectral data have the capability to detect methane plumes of large point sources. As such, a wide range of quantification approaches have been developed to quantify methane source rates based on this dataset. Most of the existing methods, however, require auxiliary data, such as wind speed, and have large uncertainties. In this study, we introduce a novel approach based on deep learning models to enhance the precision of methane quantification using Sentinel-2 data without the reliance on external data sources. To train the proposed deep learning model, a comprehensive benchmark dataset has been generated, using Sentinel-2 data. This dataset is created by integrating simulated plumes and background noise extracted from real Sentinel-2 images. This approach ensures the integration of realistic environmental conditions within the simulated data, enhancing the robustness and reliability of our proposed model. The generated benchmark dataset is utilized in different deep learning architectures, namely VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception-v3, DenseNet-121, Swin-T, and EfficientNet-V2L, to estimate methane source rate. The performance of deep models has been evaluated in three learning strategies, namely from scratch, transfer-learning, and fine-tuning. The fine-tuned EfficientNet-V2L achieves the highest accuracy with root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and Pearson R of 2101 kg h-1, 10.05%, and 95.70%, respectively. More importantly, the proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional physical-based quantification methods (e.g., integrated mass enhancement) and recently developed deep learning model techniques (e.g., MethaNet). In particular, the proposed model exhibits an improvement of approximately 1287 kg h-1 in terms of RMSE, a 3.92% reduction in MAPE, and a 5.01% enhancement in R compared to the IME method. These results highlight the advancements achieved by the proposed approach in accurately quantifying methane emissions using Sentinel-2 imagery. The generated benchmark dataset and the developed deep learning model presented in this study serve as a fundamental resource and constructive framework for future research, promoting extensive implementation across various methane monitoring scenarios on different satellites and in distinct geographic regions, which delivering greater effectiveness to global methane emission monitoring initiatives.

AB Wind represents a primary source of disturbances in forests, necessitating an assessment of the resulting damage to ensure appropriate forest management. Remote sensing, encompassing both active and passive techniques, offers a valuable and efficient approach for this purpose, enabling coverage of large areas while being costeffective. Passive remote sensing data could be affected by the presence of clouds, unlike active systems such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) which are relatively less affected. Therefore, this study aims to explore the utilization of bitemporal SAR data for windthrow detection in mountainous regions. Specifically, we investigated how the detection outcomes vary based on three factors: i) the SAR wavelength (X-band or C-band), ii) the acquisition period of the pre- and post-event images (summer, autumn, or winter), and iii) the forest type (evergreen vs. deciduous). Our analysis considers two SAR satellite constellations: COSMO-SkyMed (band-X, with a pixel spacing of 2.5 m and 10 m) and Sentinel-1 (band-C, with a pixel spacing of 10 m). We focused on three study sites located in the Trentino-South Tyrol region of Italy, which experienced significant forest damage during the Vaia storm from 27th to 30th October 2018. To accomplish our objectives, we employed a detailpreserving, scale-driven approach for change detection in bitemporal SAR data. The results demonstrate that: i) the algorithm exhibits notably better performance when utilizing X-band data, achieving a highest kappa accuracy of 0.473 and a balanced accuracy of 76.1%; ii) the pixel spacing has an influence on the accuracy, with COSMO-SkyMed data achieving kappa values of 0.473 and 0.394 at pixel spacings of 2.5 m and 10 m, respectively; iii) the post-event image acquisition season significantly affects the algorithm's performance, with summer imagery yielding superior results compared to winter imagery; and iv) the forest type (evergreen vs. deciduous) has a noticeable impact on the results, particularly when considering autumn/winter data.

AB Recent remote-sensing-based global carbon, water and energy budgets over land still include considerable uncertainties. Most existing flux products of terrestrial carbon, water and energy components were developed individually, despite the inherently coupled processes among them. In this study, we present a new set of global daily surface downwelling shortwave radiation (SW), net radiation (Rnet), evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP), terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) datasets at 0.05 degrees resolutions from 1982 to 2019, by improving a satellite-based and coupled-process model-the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS). The new version of BESS (v2.0) integrated a newly developed ecosystem respiration module, an optimality-based maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax) model, and extended the temporal coverage of flux datasets from 1982 to 2019. We evaluated BESS products against the FLUXNET2015 dataset at the site scale, and against several remote sensing and/or machine learning products on a global scale. At the site scale, BESS products agreed well with FLUXNET measurements, capturing 84%, 53%, 65%, 51% and 31% of daily variation in Rnet, ET, GPP, TER and NEE, respectively. Interannual variation in BESS NEE showed relatively low consistency with the FLUXNET measurements, while the rest fluxes explained approximately half of the interannual variation. On a global scale, we found marked discrepancies in spatio-temporal patterns between BESS and several benchmark products. Over the period 1982-2019, BESSv2.0 estimated the mean annual global Rnet, ET, GPP, TER and NEE to be 340.97 & PLUSMN; 5.22 ZJ yr- 1 (mean & PLUSMN; 1 SD), 67.67 & PLUSMN; 0.71 103 km3 yr- 1, 125.74 & PLUSMN; 5.95 Pg C yr- 1 (P < 0.01) by-0.05 103 km3 yr-2 for ET, by 0.52 Pg C yr-2 for GPP, by 0.28 Pg C yr-2 for TER, and by-0.25 Pg C yr-2 for NEE. We further evaluated various coupled processes derived by BESS in terms of functional properties (i.e., Budyko relation, carbon-use efficiency, water-use efficiency, and light-use efficiency), which agreed well with FLUXNET observations, unlike the benchmark products. Overall, BESSv2.0 can serve as a set of reliable and independent products from other global satellite products, facilitating studies related to global carbon, water and energy budgets in a coupled and comprehensive manner. , 109.30 & PLUSMN; 3.16 Pg C yr- 1, and -16.28 & PLUSMN; 2.95 Pg C yr- 1, respectively, with significant annual linear trends

AB Newly launched sensors often face challenges in obtaining sufficient observations in a short time to support the development of land surface reflectance (LSR) constraint for high-precision aerosol retrieval. To address this problem, we proposed a generalized spectral LSR reconstruction method. First, short-term overlapping observation of the target sensor and a reference sensor currently in operation is utilized to generate a representative spectral LSR comparison dataset. Then, the differences in spectral LSR caused by spectral response functions (SRF) are explored to construct a spectral LSR reconstruction model, which can convert the reference sensor's spectral LSR to match the spectral LSR of the target sensor. Finally, long-term spectral LSR data of the reference sensor can be reconstructed for the target sensor to support the surface constraint for aerosol retrieval. We applied this method to the newly launched Particulate Observing Scanning Polarimeter (POSP) instrument onboard GaoFen-5 (02) satellite, using MODIS as the reference sensor. We used one-month concurrently overlapping observation of POSP and MODIS to quantify the differences in spectral LSR and built the spectral LSR reconstruction model. Four years of MODIS LSR data were then reconstructed to develop the multispectral surface constraint scheme (B2RE) for POSP, which enables POSP data for high-precision AOD retrieval. We retrieved the global AOD at 550 nm over land for December 2021 to February 2022. Validation results of POSP AOD against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD show that the POSP AOD derived from 490 nm observation is the most accurate with the correlation coefficient (R) of 0.914, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.080, mean relative error (MRE) of 1.60% and 82.5% of the values falling into the expected error (EE) envelope of & PLUSMN; (0.05 + 0.15AODAERONET). The spatial distribution of monthly POSP AOD also has good agreement with MODIS Deep Blue AOD product.

AB Leaf spectroscopy provides an efficient way of predicting foliar functional traits, commonly using physically-and empirically-based models. However, the generality of both models has not been fully investigated, and it is not clear if inversion strategies of physically-based models can be transferred across datasets. In this study, we evaluated the generality of leaf spectroscopic models for predicting key foliar functional traits and compared the performance of physically-and empirically-based approaches. Two extensive datasets compiling a total of 3861 foliar samples were collected from 24 field sites in eastern United States and south China. The leaf radiative transfer model PROSPECT was coupled with COSINE (PROCOSINE) to retrieve foliar traits from leaf bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). A commonly used empirically-based model, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was performed as a comparison. Results showed that both PROSPECT and PROCOSINE can accurately estimate leaf mass per area (LMA) and equivalent water thickness (EWT). Inversion strategies including the selection of optimal spectral domains and the use of prior information (IS3) greatly improved the estimation accuracy of leaf nitrogen, leaf chlorophyll a + b and carotenoids. The estimation accuracies were similar when transferring inversion strategies across datasets, indicating a high level of transferability of physically-based models. PLSR and interval PLSR (iPLSR, via feature selection) could predict foliar traits with high accuracies when cross-validation was performed, and iPLSR achieved higher accuracies. But both the empirical approaches demon-strated low transferability when applied to an independent dataset. Our findings highlight the importance of generalized traits models with respect to development and calibration of leaf radiative transfer model, as well as incorporating representative samples in training empirical models. This study can help us to better understand the variation of foliar traits among and within species, their response to environmental change, as well as plant biodiversity.

AB SAR satellites are used for monitoring ships worldwide. Moving ships are Doppler shifted by an amount proportional to their velocity. An offset between the ship and its wake is then produced during SAR processing. We present a novel automatic method for calculating the ship velocity. The method relies on multitask deep learning to estimate the offset and ship heading. From these parameters, the ship velocity can be obtained. A convolutional neural network is trained using a coupled loss function. The loss function allows both parameters to be estimated at the same time. We show the methods' effectiveness for ships in Sentinel-1 SAR images. For this purpose, a large dataset of 30,000 AIS annotated SAR ship images is collected. These images have 20 x 22 m pixel resolution and ships do not have a clear wake. The AIS provides the true ship velocity and allows the method to be evaluated. As a result, we can determine the ship speed with an accuracy of 1.1 m/s. The offset disappears near the azimuth direction of the SAR image. Yet, our method is reliable except for ships sailing within 2.5 degrees of the azimuth direction.

AB The growing number, size, and frequency of coastal hypoxia increasingly threaten marine ecosystem health and essential ecosystem services for human well-being. It is therefore urgent to use continuous and consistent observation and develop advanced tools to characterize and track the spatial and temporal change of coastal hypoxia. Satellite imagery with fine spatiotemporal resolution and global coverage has shown great potential for monitoring environmental changes, yet has rarely been applied to hypoxia mapping. To advance the understanding, we synthesized satellite-derived ocean color variables and dissolved oxygen measurements collected during 2014, and used random forest regression, lagged linear regression, and functional data analysis to estimate the spatiotemporal change of the hypoxia zone in the Gulf of Mexico. The three models achieved similar predictive accuracy (+/- 1.2-1.4 mg/L dissolved oxygen), but the random forest regression performed the best in estimating the bottom dissolved oxygen from satellite-derived variables. Our models also revealed time lags of roughly 0-5 and 16-19 days between the surface water process (e.g., algae bloom and ocean warming) and bottom water hypoxia, which was rarely considered in previous hypoxia studies using satellite data. Finally, our models showed that the area of Gulf hypoxia increased gradually from May and reached a peak during mid-July and mid-August in 2014, and the hypoxia zone occurred in the estuary of the Mississippi River and Suwannee River during roughly 25% of summer days. In addition to predicting the size of hypoxic zones, our study provides additional information on where, when, and how long hypoxic zones persist with greater spatial details and enables modeling hypoxic zones at near-real-time (e.g., days) temporal scales. More importantly, we demonstrate the great potential of applying satellite remote sensing for spatially explicit hypoxia mapping, which could promote more cost-effective coastal hypoxia monitoring and assessment practices.

AB The USDA Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program constructs area estimates of forest attributes through a quasi-systematic sample of field plots distributed across the contiguous US. The program is under increasing pressure to provide estimates over small areas, for which the precision of FIA estimates is limited by small sample sizes. Small area estimation (SAE) models can improve the precision of estimates by leveraging relationships between forest attributes and auxiliary data across multiple small areas of interest. SAE models with large model domains are challenged by requiring auxiliary data encompassing the large domain and by spatially varying relationships between the auxiliary data and forest attributes. We implement a Fay-Herriot SAE model that accounts for spatial variation to make estimates of forest above-ground biomass density (AGBD) within 64,000 hectare hexagons across the contiguous US. Model inference is conducted through a Bayesian paradigm, providing AGBD estimates and quantification of uncertainty through posterior standard deviations and credible intervals. We compare the utility of data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and the National Land Cover Database 2016 Tree Canopy Cover (TCC) product as auxiliary data within the model. Results show that models using GEDI data provide more precise estimates of AGBD than direct estimates using FIA plot data alone while giving accurate quantification of uncertainty. The model using only the TCC product as auxiliary data also reported more precise estimates, but a cross-validation study revealed the reported uncertainty to be overly optimistic for high-biomass areas. We demonstrate that accounting for spatial variation in the model is crucial, and that doing otherwise leads to poor quantification of uncertainty and locally biased estimates. This study not only provides an effective model for small area estimates of AGBD with a large model domain, but also emphasizes the importance of validating models and their reported errors.

AB Accurate specification of spatiotemporal errors of remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) data is essential for a correct assessment of their utility and optimally integrating multiple SM products or assimilating them into hydrological models. Although Triple Collocation Analysis (TCA) has been widely used to provide SM errors, the impact of rescaling technique on the TCA error estimates has not received major attention, which can lead to biased and inaccurate error estimates. Moreover, current knowledge about time-variant SM errors derived from TCA is still very limited, which hampers the advance of applying time-variant errors in data merging and data assimilation studies efficiently. Based on these considerations, this work aims to advance the use of the TCA for characterizing errors with a focus on the rescaling techniques, and validating TCA-based time-variant errors using global ground measurements in 759 grid cells. To this end, the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and four passive-based SM products, including Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Level-3 (SMOS-L3), SMOS INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC), Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-3 (SMAP-L3), and SMAP INRAE BORDEAUX (SMAP-IB) SM products, were considered. The time-variant error term here denotes an aggregate error magnitude over a 101 -day moving-time-window. It is found that different selection of the rescaling technique considered in TCA led to TCA error estimates with significantly different accuracy when ground-based errors are regarded as the benchmark. The optimal combination strategy to implement TCA is applying TCA to SM anomalies and rescaling the errors by coefficients derived from the TCA model. Pearson's correlation with ground-based time-variant errors is 0.62, 0.72, 0.83, 0.89, and 0.93 for SMAP-IB, SMAP-L3, SMOS-IC, SMOS-L3, and ASCAT SM, respec-tively. Considering time-variant errors in applications is necessary since time-variant errors deviate from time -invariant errors by 50% when errors are rescaled by the TCA model parameters. Time-invariant errors are greater than time-variant errors when SM products are rescaled against a reference dataset while the opposite conclusion can be drawn when errors are rescaled by the TCA coefficients. TCA-and ground-based methods provide consistent evaluations in 74.7% (77.3%), 75.8% (79.8%), 79.6% (81.1%), and 78.6% (79.7%) of the analysis period on average (median) for the TCA implementations with SMAP-L3, SMAP-IB, SMOS-L3, and SMOS-IC SM, respectively. The error analysis reveals that TCA typically underestimated ASCAT errors while overestimated passive SM errors when considering ground-based evaluation as the benchmark. Moreover, TCA was found to have relatively less power to efficiently characterize SM errors in croplands when compared with other land cover types. This study validated TCA time-variant errors using ground measurements and compared TCA-and ground-based evaluation performances on a global scale. Our work arouses particular attention to the rescaling technique selection considered in TCA, which is crucial for accurately characterizing SM errors and efficiently using them in various hydrometeorological applications.

AB As the amplifier of global climate change, climate warming exerts an important impact on the freezing/thawing cycles of soil over the Tibetan Plateau, and it shapes the trend of permafrost degradation. Intensified frozen soil collapse causes severe effects on ecosystem water and energy balance as well as on carbon cycle. Previous studies have focused on the direct effects of climate change on permafrost degradation. However, there is also growing evidence showing vegetation growth can affect regional climate system, and consequently we hypothesize that vegetation autumn phenology (i.e., the end of the growing season, EOS) may influence the start date of frozen (SOF) through feedbacks to regional climates. Using satellite greenness data derived EOS and the microwave remote sensing generated SOFESDR (freeze-thaw Earth system data record) over 2001-2018, we showed a dominant-negative (13.1% vs. 0.9%) relationship between SOFESDR and EOS, suggesting an earlier SOFESDR with a delayed EOS. We found that biogeophysical indicators served as potential connections, including surface al-bedo, soil temperature, soil water content, and evapotranspiration, for the observed relationship. We therefore proposed a new site-level SOFf(EOS)xESDR algorithm based on the EOS-SOF relationship. With ground SOFALT observed from the active layer thickness at 63 sites over Tibetan Plateau, the new model provided significantly improved estimates of SOF with Pearson's correlation coefficient (R) of 0.84 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.63 days, comapred with current remote sensing-based SOF product (R = 0.26, RMSE = 22.60 days). We further proposed a look-up table approach to map the SOF over TP and found an overall earlier SOF (24.0 +/- 15.8) than current SOFESDR products. Therefore, our results identified a significant correlation between the autumn phenology and the SOF variability, highlighting the importance of feedbacks of autumn phenology on climate change.

AB Forest maps are essential to understand forest dynamics. Due to the increasing availability of remote sensing data and machine learning models like convolutional neural networks, forest maps can these days be created on large scales with high accuracy. Common methods usually predict a map from remote sensing images without deliberately considering intermediate semantic concepts that are relevant to the final map. This makes the mapping process difficult to interpret, especially when using opaque deep learning models. Moreover, such procedure is entirely agnostic to the definitions of the mapping targets (e.g., forest types depending on variables such as tree height and tree density). Common models can at best learn these rules implicitly from data, which greatly hinders trust in the produced maps. In this work, we aim at building an explainable deep learning model for forest mapping that leverages prior knowledge about forest definitions to provide explanations to its decisions. We propose a model that explicitly quantifies intermediate variables like tree height and tree canopy density involved in the forest definitions, corresponding to those used to create the forest maps for training the model in the first place, and combines them accordingly. We apply our model to mapping forest types using very high resolution aerial imagery and lay particular focus on the treeline ecotone at high altitudes, where forest boundaries are complex and highly dependent on the chosen forest definition. Results show that our rule-informed model is able to quantify intermediate key variables and predict forest maps that reflect forest definitions. Through its interpretable design, it is further able to reveal implicit patterns in the manually-annotated forest labels, which facilitates the analysis of the produced maps and their comparison with other datasets.

AB Most mapped urban information is essentially two-dimensional, e.g., areal extent by urban cover type. There is a gap in knowledge about patterns and changes of urban built-up volumes and development intensity globally. Here we use a new dataset of global microwave backscatter for 1993-2020 to explore this third dimension of urban growth across 477 large cities. Our results show that urban backscatter correlates with an independent estimate of building volume across 8000+ urban grid cells (0.05 degrees lat/lon) in large cities in China, Europe, and the U.S.A. Regional rates of urban backscatter increase vary substantially across the three decades, with the highest rates in the 2010s across Asia, particularly in China and Southeast Asia. Microwave backscatter, a proxy for urban building volume, is correlated with Gross Domestic Product at the scale of urban grid cells across the globe, and at the city level across most regions. This time-series of scattemmeter data provides an important tool for understanding both the spatial and temporal patterns of urban volumetric growth over the past several decades.

AB Surface longwave radiation (SLWR) components, including downward longwave radiation (DLR), upward longwave radiation (ULR), and net longwave radiation (NLR), are major contributors to the Earth's surface radiation budget and play important roles in ecological, hydrological, and atmospheric processes. Previous SLWR products have different drawbacks, such as being temporally short (after 2000), spatially coarse (>= 25 km), and instantaneous values, which hinder their in-depth applications in land surface process modeling and climate trends analysis. Here, we reported the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-based Global LAnd Surface Satellites (GLASS-AVHRR) SLWR products over the global land surface at a 5 km spatial resolution and 1 day temporal resolution between 1981 and 2018. These products were generated using multiple densely connected convolutional neural networks (DesCNNs) from the AVHRR top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflected and emitted observations and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fifth generation reanalysis (ERA5) near-surface meteorological data. DesCNNs were trained using integrated SLWR samples derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based GLASS, Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Synoptic (CERES-SYN), and ERA5 SLWR products. In situ measurements from 231 globally distributed sites were used to evaluate the GLASS-AVHRR SLWR estimates. The results illustrated the overall high accuracies of GLASS-AVHRR SLWR products with root-mean-square-errors (RMSEs) of 18.66, 14.92, and 16.29 Wm(-2), and mean bias errors (MBEs) of-2.69,-3.77, and 0.49 Wm(-2) for all-sky DLR, ULR, and NLR, respectively. We found good correlation and consistency between GLASS-AVHRR and both CERES-SYN and ERA5 in terms of spatial patterns, latitudinal gradient, and temporal evolution. Our results revealed the significant contribution of shortwave observations to SLWR estimation owing to the high amounts of clouds over polar regions and water vapor and clouds in tropical areas, which was not previously widely recognized by the remote sensing community. GLASS-AVHRR SLWR products were updated, documented, and made available to the public at www.glass.umd.edu and www.geodata.cn.

AB Land subsidence associated with groundwater overexploitation in the Alto Guadalentin Basin (Spain) aquifer system has been detected during the last decades. In this work, for the first time, we propose a new point cloud differencing methodology to detect land subsidence at basin scale, based on the multiscale model-to-model cloud comparison (M3C2) algorithm. This method is applied to two open-access airborne LiDAR datasets acquired in 2009 and 2016, respectively. First the internal edge connection errors in the different flight lines were addressed by means of a smoothing point cloud method. LiDAR datasets capture information from ground and non-ground points. Therefore, a method combining gradient filtering and cloth simulation filtering (CSF) algorithms was applied to remove non-ground points. The iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm was used for point cloud registration of both point clouds exhibiting a very stable and robust performance. The results show that vertical deformation rates are up to-14 cm/year in the basin from 2009 to 2016, in agreement with the displacement reported by previous studies. LiDAR results have been compared to the velocity measured by continuous GNSS stations and an InSAR dataset. For the GNSS-LiDAR and InSAR-LiDAR comparison, we computed a common 100 x 100 m grid in order to assess any similarities and discrepancies. The results show a good agreement between the vertical displacements obtained from the three different surveying techniques. Furthermore, LiDAR results were compared with the distribution of compressible soil thickness showing a clear relationship. The study underlines the potential of open-access and non-customized LiDAR to monitor the distribution and magnitude of vertical deformations in areas prone to be affected by groundwater-withdrawal-induced land subsidence.

AB Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) represents an important component of the global water cycle. Improved assessment of SGD occurrences provides information to constrain current estimates of total freshwater discharges, which are crucial for evaluation of changes in the global water cycle. This study leverages SGD linkages to patterns in sea surface temperature (SST) and color. Typically, groundwater temperatures exhibit less variability than SST and tend to have temperature distinct from sea water. Consequently, thermally anomalous plumes often occur in coastal areas with SGD. Nutrient-enriched groundwater flows have been linked to changes in ocean color as a consequence of algae growth and of the presence of colored dissolved organic matter. Under such conditions, SGD presence may also manifest as plumes of different colors. Changes in SST and color can be captured through satellite imagery for the thermal infrared and visible bands, which are used here to detect potential SGD (PSGD) occurrences. A method based on clustering and spectroscopy techniques is applied to automatically detect PSGD plumes. SST data are clustered to map SST anomalies. Derivative analysis and angular distance are applied to identify a color signature linked to SGD. In a novel approach, SST and color are combined to identify PSGD through remote sensing. The methods presented in this study were applied to Landsat 7 and 8 imagery captured over southern Ireland and the west coast of the Island of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, where past field surveys of radon isotopes activities and salinity have documented SGD occurrences. These selected sites are used as validation points. Derivative analysis and angular distance resulted in PSGD plumes in the vicinity of sampled locations, mainly locations with samples that are strong indicators of SGD. In general, the PSGD plumes derived from each method are compared as independent, parallel lines of evidence of PSGD occurrences. Results also show that PSGD pixels from derivative analysis and angular distance alone, without considering SST, can be obfuscated by confounding factors, such as low tides and unrelated chlorophyll enrichment, and that combining SST and color data reduces those effects. These results provide further evidence for PSGD occurrences along the south coast of Ireland and the west coast of the Island of HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, and showcase that satellite data can be used to better identify the location of PSGD occurrences over large areas.

AB Foliar biochemical traits are important indicators of ecosystem functioning and health that are impractical to characterize at large spatial and temporal scales using traditional measurements. However, comprehensive inventories of foliar traits are important for understanding ecosystem responses to anthropogenic and natural disturbances, as inputs into ecosystem process models, and for quantifying spatial variation in functional diversity. Imaging spectroscopy has been demonstrated as a valuable tool for developing maps of ecologically important foliar traits at large scales, but its application to mapping foliar traits over the course of the growing season has been limited. We collected high-resolution imaging spectroscopy data over Blackhawk Island, Wisconsin, USA at eight time points during the 2018 growing season (May - October). Using partial least squares regression (PLSR) we developed predictive models applicable to all dates to produce canopy-level maps of eight traits related to ecophysiological function: chlorophyll content, leaf mass per area and concentrations of calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, phenolics and lignin. The accuracy of our models varied across traits (R2: 0.25-0.86); traits with well-defined absorption features were retrieved with high accuracy including chlorophyll (R2: 0.86; %RMSE: 11.0) and total phenolics (R2: 0.86; %RMSE: 11.0). We also assessed how well our models estimated biochemistry on novel species and new dates using a cross-validation analysis. Chlorophyll and total phenolics were well estimated across withheld dates and species, whereas calcium was estimated poorly on both withheld species (R2: 0.08) and dates (R2: 0.07). Our canopy-level maps of macronutrients (N, P and K) showed general trends of decreasing concentration over the course of the year, reflecting dilution by carbon-rich compounds during the growing season and resorption during senescence. Conversely, recalcitrant compounds including lignin and calcium increased until late summer, after which they stabilized. These results demonstrate the potential of current and proposed spaceborne imaging spectroscopy missions for mapping seasonal patterns in foliar biochemistry at a global scale.

AB Under the influence of climate change, permafrost landforms are sensitive to seasonal heave and contraction, thus exacerbating surface instability and fostering landslides as a consequence. In the pastureland of Zhimei on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a typical earthflow has drawn significant attention through social media. However, detailed knowledge of the deformation characteristics, internal hydrothermal regime, and structure is still scarce. In this study, we aim to enhance traditional satellite synthetic aperture radar interferometry to divide ground deformation into the seasonal oscillation and slope deformation components and identify the magnitude and spatial distribution of unstable slopes in frozen regions. Then, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) was combined with geophysical monitoring techniques to recognise the deformation dynamics from the pre- to post-failure stages. Sentinel-1 images, covering almost five years, highlighted that obvious creep behaviour dominated at the pre-failure stage, while a seasonal deformation pattern characterised by a piecewise distribution associated with the hydrothermal regime was observed at the post-failure stage. Fast retrogressive erosion on the head scarps at the post-failure stage was clearly identified by multidifferential digital surface models from the UAV observations. To better understand the internal structure, both electrical resistivity tomography and ground-penetrating radar were combined to determine the seasonal frozen thickness, underlying thawing materials, and vertical cracks, which controlled the kinematic evolution from the initial creep to the narrow and long oversaturated flow that represented the terminal portion of the landslide. Finally, by comparing in situ monitoring data with field investigations, the main driving factors controlling the movement mechanism are discussed. Our results highlight the specific kinematic behaviour of an earthflow and can provide a reference for slope destabilisation on the QTP under the influence of climate change.

   TRENDS
AB Vegetation growth drives many of the interactions between the land surface and atmosphere including the uptake of carbon through photosynthesis and loss of water through transpiration. In arid and semi-arid regions water is the dominant driver of vegetation growth. However, few studies consider the fact that water can move laterally across the landscape as runoff via streams and floodplains, termed hydrologic connectivity. Using multiple observations alongside models and a hydromorphology dataset for Australia, we examine how ecosystems with high hydrologic connectivity differ in their vegetation response to water availability, soil properties, and interannual variability and extremes in vegetation productivity. We find that the average interannual variability of vegetation productivity is 21-34% higher in ecosystems with high hydrologic connectivity, with skewed annual anomalies showing larger extremes in carbon uptake. This is driven by a higher average and more variable surface soil moisture and significantly higher soil available water capacity and soil depth. These spatially small ecosystems, covering 14% of the study region, contribute 15-22% (median = 17%) to regionalscale carbon uptake through higher rates of gross photosynthesis, especially evident during wet years, and 3-37% (median = 19%) to annual anomalies. Current global land surface models do not reproduce the observed spatial patterns of interannual variability in carbon uptake over regions where hydrologic connectivity is high as they lack the mechanism of connectivity of water between discrete land surface elements. This study highlights the significant role of riparian and floodplain vegetation on the interannual variability and extremes of the regional carbon cycle.

AB Compared with disturbance maps produced at annual or multi-year time steps, monthly mapping of forest harvesting can provide more temporal details needed for studying the socio-economic drivers (e.g., differentiating salvage logging and slash-and-burn from other timber harvesting) of harvesting and characterizing the associated intra-annual carbon and hydrological dynamics. Frequent cloud cover limits the application of optical remote sensing in timely mapping of forest changes. The freely available Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve more frequent mapping of forest harvesting than ever before (i.e., at monthly interval). The unique landscape pattern of forest harvesting from Sentienl-1 data (i. e., how a harvested patch contrasts to surrounding intact forests) holds critical information for harvesting mapping but have not been fully explored. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based (i.e., U-Net) approach using the landscape pattern from Sentinel-1 data to produce monthly maps of forest harvesting in two deforestation hotspots -California, USA and Rondo<SIC>nia, Brazil - for as long as three years. Our results show that (1) our proposed approach is reliable (mean F1 scores (the geometric mean of user's and producer's accuracies) 0.74-0.78; mean IoU (the area of intersection over union between the prediction part and target part) 0.59-0.65) for monthly forest harvesting mapping with Sentinel-1 data, outperforming the traditional object-based approach (0.38-0.43 in IoU). The varying harvesting pattern from Sentinel-1 data can be recognized by the U-Net bottleneck block as whole entities, which is the key advantage of our proposed approach; (2) multi-temporal SAR filtering is helpful for improving the accuracies of our proposed approach (increased F1 and IoU for 0.04 and 0.06, respectively); (3) our proposed model can be trained using samples collected during a particular time period over one location and be fine-tuned using sparse local samples from a new area to achieve optimal performance, and hence can greatly reduce training data collection effort when applied to new study sites; (4) forest harvesting maps produced using our approach revealed substantial variations in monthly harvesting activities: in Rondo<SIC>nia, most of the forest harvest occurred in July/August (the dry season) and about 14% of the dry season harvesting were followed by fires (i.e., slash-and-burn); in California, the rates of forest harvesting were relatively stable, but abnormally high values could occur due to salvage logging after big fires. Our novel approach for mapping forest harvesting at monthly interval represents an important step towards timely monitoring of forest harvesting and assisting stakeholders in developing sustainable strategy of forest management, especially for regions with frequent cloud cover.

AB Floods are causing massive losses of crops and agricultural infrastructures in many regions across the globe. During the 2018/2019 agricultural year, heavy rains from Cyclone Idai caused flooding in Central Mozambique and had the greatest impact on Sofala Province. The main objectives of this study are to map the flooding durations, evaluate how long crops survived the floods, and analyse the dynamics of the affected crops and their recovery following various flooding durations using multi-source satellite data. Our results indicate that Otsu method-based flooding mapping provides reliable flood extents and durations with an overall accuracy higher than 90%, which facilitates the assessment of how long crops can survive floods and their recovery progress. Croplands in both Buzi and Tica administrative units were the most severely impacted among all the regions in Sofala Province, with the largest flooded cropland extent at 23,101.1 ha in Buzi on 20 March 2019 and the most prolonged flooding duration of more than 42 days in Tica and Mafambisse. Major summer crops, including maize and rice, could survive when the fields were inundated for up to 12 days, while all crops died when the flooding duration was longer than 24 days. The recovery of surviving crops to pre-flooding status took a much longer time, from approximately 20 days to as long as one month after flooding. The findings presented herein can assist decision making in developing countries or remote regions for flood monitoring, mitigation and damage assessment.

In this study, we performed a systematic review of the available literature to assess the performance of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) products across different geographical locations and climatic conditions around the globe. Asia, and in particular China, are the subject of the largest number of IMERG evaluation studies on the continental and country level. When compared to ground observational records, IMERG is found to vary with seasons, as well as precipitation type, structure, and intensity. It is shown to appropriately estimate and detect regional precipitation patterns, and their spatial mean, while its performance can be improved over mountainous regions characterized by orographic precipitation, complex terrains, and for winter precipitation. Furthermore, despite IMERG's better performance compared to other satellite products in reproducing spatio-temporal patterns and variability of extreme precipitation, some limitations were found regarding the precipitation intensity. At the temporal scales, IMERG performs better at monthly and annual time steps than the daily and sub-daily ones. Finally, in terms of hydrological application, the use of IMERG has resulted in significant discrepancies in streamflow simulation. However, and most importantly, we find that each new version that replaces the previous one, shows substantial improvement in almost every spatiotemporal scale and climatic condition. Thus, despite its limitations, IMERG evolution reveals a promising path for current and future applications.

AB Lakes and other surface fresh waterbodies provide drinking water, recreational and economic opportunities, food, and other critical support for humans, aquatic life, and ecosystem health. Lakes are also productive ecosystems that provide habitats and influence global cycles. Chlorophyll concentration provides a common metric of water quality, and is frequently used as a proxy for lake trophic state. Here, we document the generation and distribution of the complete MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS; Appendix A provides a complete list of abbreviations) radiometric time series for over 2300 satellite resolvable inland bodies of water across the contiguous United States (CONUS) and more than 5,000 in Alaska. This contribution greatly increases the ease of use of satellite remote sensing data for inland water quality monitoring, as well as highlights new horizons in inland water remote sensing algorithm development. We evaluate the performance of satellite remote sensing Cyanobacteria Index (CI)-based chlorophyll algorithms, the retrievals for which provide surrogate estimates of phytoplankton concentrations in cyanobacteria dominated lakes. Our analysis quantifies the algorithms' abilities to assess lake trophic state across the CONUS. As a case study, we apply a bootstrapping approach to derive a new CI-to-chlorophyll relationship, Chl(BS), which performs relatively well with a multiplicative bias of 1.11 (11%) and mean absolute error of 1.60 (60%). While the primary contribution of this work is the distribution of the MERIS radiometric timeseries, we provide this case study as a roadmap for future stakeholders' algorithm development activities, as well as a tool to assess the strengths and weaknesses of applying a single algorithm across CONUS.

AB Nighttime images taken with DSLR cameras from the International Space Station (ISS) can provide valuable information on the spatial and temporal variation of artificial nighttime lighting on Earth. In particular, this is the only source of historical and current visible multispectral data across the world (DMSP/OLS and SNPP/VIIRSDNB data are panchromatic and multispectral in the infrared but not at visible wavelengths). The ISS images require substantial processing and proper calibration to exploit intensities and ratios from the RGB channels. Here we describe the different calibration steps, addressing in turn Decodification, Linearity correction (ISO dependent), Flat field/Vignetting, Spectral characterization of the channels, Astrometric calibration/georeferencing, Photometric calibration (stars)/Radiometric correction (settings correction by exposure time, ISO, lens transmittance, etc) and Transmittance correction (window transmittance, atmospheric correction). We provide an example of the application of this processing method to an image of Spain.

AB Most polar-orbit-satellite based passive microwave radiometers, e.g. AMSR-2 and the FY-3B Microwave Radiation Imager (FY3B-MWRI), have the revisit cycles of-2 days in low latitudes. This indicates that requirement of complete global coverage on the daily basis has not been met. On the other hand, using synergistic observations from different radiometers seems promising to enhance the temporal resolution of observations in such areas, whereas cross-radiometer inter-calibration is essential prior to their synergism. For this purpose, conventional inter-calibration models are usually built based on linear relations of brightness temperature (TB) between different radiometers. However, the linear model has relatively poor performance in low latitudes primarily due to wet surface conditions. In this study, we propose an improved non-linear model for calibrating MWRI TB against AMSR-2 TB at 18.7 GHz and 23.8 GHz channels. Global land surface temperature (LST) is estimated using the post-calibration MWRI TB data and then validated against AMSR-2 based LST, MODIS based LST, and in situ near-surface air temperature datasets in low latitudes respectively. The validation results show that LST outcome based on the improved non-linear inter-calibration method has smaller global Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) below 3.5 K, compared with the RMSEs of-6 K obtained from the conventional linear inter-calibration method and from the results without inter-calibration. Further analysis also shows that synergistic observations between AMSR-2 and MWRI are capable of shortening the maximum global revisit cycle of AMSR-2 LST from-2 days to less than 1.2 days. These results indicate that the improved inter-calibration method is effective for obtaining daily LST datasets with quasi-complete global coverage and reliable accuracy.

AB Satellite remote sensing is an important tool to retrieve terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET). Widely-used MOD16 ET product (MOD-ET) is a representative of Penman-Monteith method coupled with MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optic observations. Although MOD-ET has been extensively evaluated over the world, its accuracy under various cloud conditions remains unevaluated. Combining MODIS-observed cloud cover (Frc) and in-situ measurements at sixteen forests sites in East Asia, we evaluated 8-day MOD-ET and its primary MODIS inputs (i.e. LAI, FPAR and albedo) from clear to cloudy sky. A new satellite microwave ET method based on microwave Emissivity Difference Vegetation Index (EDVI-ET) was also compared with MODET. Results showed that the accuracy of MOD-ET was highly variable under the changing Frc over the forests. The largest bias ( 10%, while slight increase of Frc (10%-30%) reduced the bias (10%-20%). Further increase of Frc ( 13%) under similar sky conditions. A higher Taylor score (0.84) for EDVI-ET was found under Frc of 4% than MOD-ET (0.66), while two ET had close scores ( 0.81) under other sky conditions. Further investigation found that MOD-ET over four tropical coastal forests contributed most to the bias, especially under least cloudy sky. A case study at a tropical forest showed that MODIS LAI/FPAR and surface albedo products were overestimated, which could directly cause the overestimation of canopy-scale conductance and the underestimation of net solar radiation in MOD-ET method, respectively. Analysis showed that the bias in MOD-ET was significantly related to the bias in MODIS LAI under various Frc, but it was weakly related to that in MODIS albedo, suggesting that LAI-based conductance might dominate the overestimation of MOD-ET. During a consecutive cloud cover period when fewer reliable MODIS pixels are available, slight increase of clouds partly reduced MODIS-observed signals of LAI/FPAR and increased those of albedo over the tropical forest, resulting in the lower bias in MOD-ET. More clouds reduced surface MODIS albedo and might increase the uncertainty in all-sky shortwave radiation from reanalysis data, which deteriorated MOD-ET accuracy under overcast sky. Our study highlighted the importance of cloud impacts on the satellite ET estimation.

AB Large-scale high-resolution satellite observations of plant functional diversity patterns will greatly benefit our ability to study ecosystem functioning. Here, we demonstrate a potentially scalable approach that uses aggregate plant traits estimated from radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion of Sentinel-2 satellite images to calculate community patterns of plant functional diversity. Trait retrieval relied on simulations and Look-up Tables (LUTs) generated by a RTM rather than heavily depending on a priori field data and data-driven statistical learning. This independence from in-situ training data benefits its scalability as relevant field data remains scarce and difficult to acquire. We ran a total of three different inversion algorithms that are representative of commonly applied approaches and we used two different metrics to calculate functional diversity. In tandem with Sentinel-2 image-based estimation of plant traits, we measured Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf Chlorophyll content (CAB), and Leaf Mass per Area (LMA) in-situ in a (semi-)natural heterogeneous landscape (Montesinho region) located in northern Portugal. Sampling plots were scaled and georeferenced to match the satellite observed pixels and thereby allowed for a direct one-to-one posterior ground truth validation of individual traits and functional diversity. Across approaches, we observe a reasonable correspondence between the satellite-based retrievals and the insitu observations in terms of the relative distribution of individual trait means and plant functional diversity across locations despite the heterogeneity of the landscape and canopies. The functional diversity estimates, based on a combination of canopy and leaf traits, were robust against estimation biases in trait means. Particularly, the convex hull volume estimate of functional diversity showed strong concordance with in-situ observations across all three inversion methods (Spearman's rho: 0.67-0.80). The remotely sensed estimates of functional diversity also related to in-situ taxonomic diversity (Spearman's rho: 0.55-0.63). Our work highlights the potential and challenges of RTM-based functional diversity metrics to study spatial community-level ecological patterns using currently operational and publicly available Sentinel-2 imagery. While further validation and assessment across different ecosystems and larger datasets are needed, the study contributes towards a further maturation of scalable, spatially, and temporally explicit methods for functional diversity assessments from space.

AB The monitoring of forested ecosystems relies on an accurate description of forest structure. The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), launched in September 2018, carries the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument capable of detecting individual photons reflected back from vegetation canopy. ICESat-2 data is delivering global estimates of forest structure; however, analysis of the performance of ICESat-2 on-orbit data across a range of forest conditions remains limited. This study derives structural estimates of (i) canopy height, (ii) canopy cover and (iii) canopy height variability from ICESat-2 data acquired in snow-free and low atmospheric scattering conditions over different boreal forest structural types in Ontario, Canada. ICESat-2 structural estimates were derived from the Global Geolocated Photon Data (ATL03) and Land and Vegetation Height (ATL08) data products and compared against single-photon detection airborne LiDAR (Leica SPL100). An extensive network of ground plots were used to stratify the study area into three distinct forest structural groups, each resulting from different stand development stages. ICESat-2 and SPL100 estimates of canopy height were compared at the ATL03 photon level, whereas estimates of height variability and canopy cover were compared for spatial analysis units (AU; mean size = 1287 m2). ICESat-2 photons returned from the top of the canopy underestimated canopy height relative to SPL100 by an average of 2.3 m overall and corresponded most strongly to the 90th percentile (P90) of coincident airborne SPL100 returns (root mean square difference (RMSD) = 2.9 m and correlation coefficient (r) = 0.84). The lowest average underestimation of SPL P90 was observed in homogeneous stands that were relatively simple, and singlelayered with a single dominant species (RMSD = 2.5 m, r = 0.84). We observed the least agreement of ICESat-2 and SPL forest structural metrics in over-mature stands with complex structure and greater variability in canopy heights (RMSD = 3.5 m, r = 0.64). For the AUs, the strength of the relationship between SPL100 and ICESat-2 canopy height percentiles increased with increasing height percentiles (e.g. P25 RMSD% = 77.8%; P95 RMSD% = 23.7%). ICESat-2 generally underestimated canopy height variability relative to the SPL100 data, with both data having similar absolute variability (standard deviation of canopy heights RMSD% = 26.8%, r = 0.75), but lower agreement in relative variability (coefficient of variation of canopy heights RMSD% = 33.9%, r = 0.45). Herein we propose the use of the vegetation fill index as a method to estimate canopy cover with ICESat-2. Comparison of SPL100 and ICESat-2 vegetation fill indices at the AU level resulted in strong agreement overall (RMSD% = 19.7%; r = 0.57). These observations and results contribute to the overall objective of building a comprehensive understanding of the performance of ICESat-2 for characterizing vegetation structure in boreal forest environments.

AB Strong ground vibration triggered by seismic waves is one of the most significant factors that causes building damage during a seismic event. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique can efficiently and quickly provide seismic deformation information. There is no clear relationship model between seismic deformation and the degree of building damage.
   Considering the earthquake that hit Wenchuan (China) on May 12, 2008, in this work, a method to evaluate the degree of building damage based on coseismic deformation is presented. Based on 51 building area samples selected, taking the Deformation normalization index(DNI) as the independent variable and the earthquake damage index (EDI) of the field survey data provided by the China Earthquake Administration (CEA) as the dependent variable, the relationships between seismic damage survey data and the seismic deformation of adobe structures, brick-wood structures, brick-concrete structures and reinforced concrete frame structures are analysed. There are linear relationships between the normalized deformation indices of adobe and brick-concrete structure types and the EDIs of buildings. There are quadratic relationships between the normalized seismic deformation indices of brick-wood structures and reinforced concrete frame construction types and the EDIs of buildings. Additionally, the regional curve estimates of the comprehensive building damage index and the normalized index of seismic deformation show that there is a quadratic relationship between the comprehensive building damage index and the normalized index of seismic deformation. The validity of the modelling method was verified by data from the Yushu earthquake in 2010. The results can provide an accurate and reliable reference basis for post-earthquake rescue and decision making. The work represents a new concept and method for the rapid assessment of building damage data from the perspective of surface deformation movement by addressing methodological steps, highlighting the potential of using the coseismic deformation field obtained during building damage assessment, and discussing the potential and limitations of InSAR technology in the field of damage detection.

AB Spatio-temporal phenological information is essential for regional crop monitoring and accurate management. This study aimed to obtain the spatio-temporal distribution of rice phenology using time series Sentinel-1A images. In this study, a systematic method for spatial and temporal phenological estimation was developed based on multi-temporal Sentinel data. This method consisted of: (1) the Spectral Similarity Measures (SSM) approach for rice mapping, and (2) the DTHT-PF approach, which includes a dynamic threshold algorithm (DT), a hierarchical tree (HT), and a particle filter (PF) used for phenology estimation. Thereinto, a dynamic threshold algorithm for transplanting date retrieval and a hierarchical tree for obtaining an initial phenology, which is then run through a PF, are proposed based on the SAR backscatter time series. In brief, we found that the VH backscatter has the potential to provide accurate phenological estimations for paddy rice. Furthermore, rice mapping at a high accuracy level of 92.97%, transplanting date retrieval, and initial phenology estimations lay a good foundation for understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of rice phenology. A determination factor (R2) and a root mean square error (RMSE) obtained using the DTHT-PF method were much higher (approximately 0.52 in the difference) and lower (approximately 14.67 in the difference), respectively, than those obtained using the PF approach with uniform initialization. R2 and RMSE values obtained using the real-time DTHT-PF method are slightly different from those obtained using the non-real-time DTHT-PF method. Map analysis revealed that the transplanting dates and the spatial distribution phenology were larger in the west and north of the study area near the South China Sea because of higher temperatures and earlier transplanting. Altogether, our results suggest that the DTHT-PF method and the VH backscatter obtained from the Sentinel-1A images have great potential for furthering our understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of phenology estimation. This information can greatly contribute to the improvement of precision agriculture, including crop monitoring and yield predictions.

AB In recent years, ultraviolet (UV) bands have received increasing attention from the ocean colour remote sensing community, as they may contribute to improving atmospheric correction and inherent optical properties (IOPs) retrieval. However, most ocean colour satellite sensors do not have UV bands, and the accurate retrieval of UV remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) from UV satellite data is still a challenge. In order to address this problem, this study proposes a hybrid approach for estimating UV Rrs from the visible bands. The approach was implemented with two popular ocean colour satellite sensors, i.e. GCOM-C SGLI and Sentinel-3 OLCI. In situ Rrs collected globally and simulated Rrs spectra were used to develop UV Rrs retrieval models, and UV Rrs values at 360, 380 and 400 nm were estimated from visible Rrs spectra. The performances of the established models were evaluated using in situ Rrs and satellite data, and applied to a semi-analytical algorithm for IOPs retrieval. The results showed that: (i) UV Rrs retrieval models had low uncertainties with mean absolute percentage differences (MAPD) less than 5%; (ii) the model assessment with in situ Rrs showed high accuracy (r = 0.92?1.00 and MAPD = 1.11%?10.95%) in both clear open ocean and optically complex waters; (iii) the model assessment with satellite data indicated that model-estimated UV Rrs were more consistent with in situ values than satellite-derived UV Rrs; and (iv) model-estimated UV Rrs may improve the decomposition accuracy of absorption coefficients in semi-analytical IOPs algorithm. Thus, the proposed method has great potentials for reconstructing UV Rrs data and improving IOPs retrieval for historical satellite sensors, and might also be useful for UV-based atmospheric correction algorithms.

AB Longwave-infrared (LWIR) spectral imaging offers a means for detecting and sourcing halocarbon emissions with high sensitivity, with the principal halocarbon classes of environmental concern being detectable at flux rates of -0.2-2 kg/h. Broad-area airborne LWIR surveys efficiently locate and speciate halocarbon emissions on local to regional scales and can promote more effective compliance efforts. Similar approaches can also contribute to the effective situational awareness and mitigation of releases resulting from infrastructure damage following catastrophic events of natural origin or occurring as a consequence of human action. Three U.S. urban domains were surveyed: Greater Los Angeles, San Francisco East Bay, and New York City. In each of the California conurbations the most frequently observed halocarbons were HFC-134a, HCFC-22, and HFC-152a while in New York HCFC-22, HFC-32, and HFC-134a were prevalent. The most common radiatively important non-halocarbon agents observed in each locale were carbon dioxide and methane.

AB Total suspended solids (TSS) concentration is an important biogeochemical parameter for water quality management and sediment-transport studies. In this study, we propose a novel semi-analytical method for estimating TSS in clear to extremely turbid waters from remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). The proposed method includes three sub-algorithms used sequentially. First, the remotely sensed waters are classified into clear (Type I), moderately turbid (Type II), highly turbid (Type III), and extremely turbid (Type IV) water types by comparing the values of R-rs at 490, 560, 620, and 754 nm. Second, semi-analytical models specific to each water type are used to determine the particulate backscattering coefficients (b(bp)) at a corresponding single wavelength (i.e., 560 nm for Type I, 665 nm for Type II, 754 nm for Type III, and 865 nm for Type IV). Third, a specific relationship between TSS and b(bp) at the corresponding wavelength is used in each water type. Unlike other existing approaches, this method is strictly semi-analytical and its sub-algorithms were developed using synthetic datasets only. The performance of the proposed method was compared to that of three other state-of-the-art methods using simulated (N = 1000, TSS ranging from 0.01 to 1100 g/m(3)) and in situ measured (N = 3421, TSS ranging from 0.09 to 2627 g/m(3)) pairs of R-rs and TSS. Results showed a significant improvement with a Median Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 16.0% versus 30.2-90.3% for simulated data and 39.7% versus 45.9-58.1% for in situ data, respectively. The new method was subsequently applied to 175 MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and 498 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) images acquired in the 2003-2020 timeframe to produce long-term TSS time-series for Lake Suwa and Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. Performance assessments using MERIS and OLCI matchups showed good agreements with in situ TSS measurements.

AB Intensified anthropogenic activities and high levels of energy consumption in cities have led to an increase in emissions of CO2 and air pollutants, impacting air quality and calling for better measures to monitor and reduce emissions. This study assesses the emission characteristics of cities in the Northern Hemisphere during two winter seasons from December 2018 to March 2020 using a combination of CO2 observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (000-2) along with CO and NO2 observations from the Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPO-spheric Monitoring Instrument (S-5P TROPOMI). We calculate the estimates of urban enhancement concentrations of CO2, CO, and NO2 from anthropogenic emissions in cities. Moreover, using ratios of CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 according to each city, we analyze the relationship between CO2 and air pollutants and find that cities show distinct emission patterns according to where they are located in different regions of the world. Our analysis shows that a positive relationship exists in the comparisons of CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 ratios to city population and GDP. However, when cities in the Northern Hemisphere are divided into "developed" and "developing" regions, a difference in pattern is found where most developed cities show a smaller increase of both CO/CO2 and NO2/CO2 ratios with the increase of GDP, while developing cities show a larger increase of ratios per increase of GDP. Especially, developing cities facing rapid economic development like Mumbai and Tianjin show high emission ratios that almost match that of developed cities. The higher incline of increase in emission ratios in developing cities can be attributed to the low combustion efficiency of fossil fuels along with less stringent pollution control measures. This implies that pollution control measures are crucial for effective management of air quality degradation with economic advancement within these developing cities. The analysis also highlights the importance of urban geological features in cities such as that of Tehran and Milan which can trap air pollution under appropriate meteorological conditions. Despite the short period of analysis, our study demonstrates that satellite observations of CO2 and air pollutants together can provide clues about factors controlling the co-emission of air pollutants and carbon in cities and suggests that the application of the proposed methods with longer periods of observation will support coupled air quality and climate mitigation strategies.

AB The evolution of vegetation patterns plays a crucial role in monitoring ecosystem dynamics in face of global warming. Notably, the time-series vegetation trends vary unevenly over time. However, conventional linear methods based on the stationarity assumption, cannot detect the implicit characteristics of nonlinear and gradual vegetation changes. Meanwhile, characterizing the inherent features of nonlinearity and nonstationarity of climatic drivers remains a challenge. This study applied multidimensional ensemble empirical mode decomposition (MEEMD) and Breaks For Additive Seasonal and Trend (BEAST) algorithm to diagnose spatiotemporal evolution and abrupt change in vegetation secular trends based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data of the Hexi Corridor during 1982-2015. Geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) was used to address the spatiotemporal nonlinearity and nonstationarity of climatic drivers. A wide range of browning trends gradually evolved into greening trends from 1982 to 2015. Compared with ordinary least squares regression, MEEMD could adaptively decompose short-term trends of noise and seasonality and elucidate the entire evolutionary process of NDVI trends. Browning trends prevailed before abrupt changes, and greening trends widely expanded after 2006 due to drought before and intense precipitation during this year. GTWR addressed the nonequilibrium effect of the time dimension on climate drivers, and the R-squared achieved 0.86. The response processes between vegetation and climatic drivers showed significant spatiotemporal nonstationarity and aggregation characteristics based on three-dimensional visualization. In addition to the drivers of temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and potential evapotranspiration, the drying effect and mechanical stimuli of wind speed on vegetation could not be underestimated. This study provides a novel framework to solve nonlinearity and nonstationarity problems related to vegetation trends and their response mechanisms and promotes the application of remote sensing to solve practical problems.

AB Estimation of essential vegetation properties from remote sensing is crucial for a quantitative understanding of the Earth system. Ill-posedness of the model inversion problem leads to multiple interpretations of one satellite observation, and using prior information is a promising way to reduce the ill-posedness and increase the accuracy of land surface products. Tobler's first law of geography states that "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things". Likewise, it is expected that the state of an object at a single moment is related to the state at every other moment, but temporally near attributes are more related than distant ones. This temporal autocorrelation is a vital source of prior information and can be used to improve the retrieval accuracy. In this study, we develop a retrieval framework that makes use of the temporal autocorrelation and dependence of land surface and atmospheric properties. We apply this retrieval algorithm to Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) satellite data to derive land surface biophysical variables with a focus on leaf area index (LAI) from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance observations. The results from both a synthetic dataset and a real satellite dataset show that the use of the temporal continuity as a priori information improves the accuracy of the estimation of land surface properties, such as leaf chlorophyll content and LAI. Compared with the MODIS LAI products, much less unrealistic short-term fluctuations are found in the LAI retrievals from OLCI with the time-series retrieval approach across different land cover types including cropland, forest and savannah. Field measurements of LAI at two forest sites quantitatively confirm that the estimated LAI from OLCI is reasonably accurate with R-2 > 0.65 and RMSE < 1.00 m(2)m(-2). Overall, the time series retrieval results in more robust and smoother time series than standard retrievals of LAI from individual scenes, more stable retrievals than the MODIS LAI product, and values of LAI that match better with reported measurements in the field. The present retrieval framework can make better use of time series of spectral observations and potentially of multi-sensor observations.

AB Knowledge of flowering phenology is essential for understanding the condition of forest ecosystems and responses to various anthropogenic and environmental drivers. However, monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in forest flowering at landscape scales is challenging (e.g. current monitoring is often highly localized and in-situ or for single dates). This study presents a method that combines drone and satellite images (PlanetScope) that can produce landscape-scale maps of flowering dynamics. This method is demonstrated in forest landscapes dominated by the eucalypt Corymbia calophylla (red gum or marri) in Western Australia. Dronederived images of flowering eucalypt canopies, available for restricted temporal and spatial extents, are used to label satellite image pixels with the proportion of a pixel footprint that is flowering. The pixels labelled with flowering proportion, the response variable, are combined with various metrics that characterize time series of spectral indices sensitive to the presence of green vegetation and cream-colored flowers, the predictor variables. A machine learning model then predicts daily pixel-level flowering proportions. The model is trained with data from two sites and is tested with data from three sites and various dates throughout the Corymbia calophylla season. The model is able to accurately predict pixel-level flowering proportion throughout the flowering season (RMSE <4% across all sites and dates), across sites with dense to sparse canopy, different background soil covers, and is robust to not detecting false positive flowering when no flowering events are occurring. Due to the spatiotemporal coverage of satellite images, this model can be deployed to generate regional maps of flowering dynamics in forest ecosystems that can be used for monitoring forest ecosystem condition and supporting research into drivers of eucalypt forest phenology.

AB The Terra/Aqua MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have been used widely for global monitoring of the Earth?s surface due to their daily fine temporal resolution. The spatial resolution of MODIS time-series (i.e., 500 m), however, is too coarse for local monitoring. A feasible solution to this problem is to downscale the coarse MODIS images, thus creating time-series images with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Generally, the downscaling of MODIS images can be achieved by fusing them with fine spatial resolution images (e.g., Landsat images) using spatio-temporal fusion methods. Among the families of spatiotemporal fusion methods, spatial unmixing-based methods have been applied widely owing to their lighter dependence on the available fine spatial resolution images. However, all techniques within this class of method suffer from the same serious problem, that is, the block effect, which reduces the prediction accuracy of spatiotemporal fusion. To our knowledge, almost no solution has been developed to tackle this issue directly. To address this need, this paper proposes a blocks-removed spatial unmixing (SU-BR) method, which removes the blocky artifacts by including a new constraint constructed based on spatial continuity. SU-BR provides a flexible framework suitable for any existing spatial unmixing-based spatio-temporal fusion method. Experimental results on a heterogeneous region, a homogeneous region and a region experiencing land cover changes show that SUBR removes the blocks effectively and increases the prediction accuracy obviously in all three regions. SU-BR also outperforms two popular spatio-temporal fusion methods. SU-BR, thus, provides a crucial solution to overcome one of the longest standing challenges in spatio-temporal fusion.

AB Ice cliffs play a key role in the mass balance of debris-covered glaciers, but assessing their importance is limited by a lack of datasets on their distribution and evolution at scales larger than an individual glacier. These datasets are often derived using operator-biased and time-consuming manual delineation approaches, despite the recent emergence of semi-automatic mapping methods. These methods have used elevation or multispectral data, but the varying slope and mixed spectral signal of these dynamic features makes the transferability of these approaches particularly challenging. We develop three semi-automated and objective new approaches, based on the Spectral Curvature and Linear Spectral Unmixing of multispectral images, to map these features at a glacier to regional scale. The transferability of each method is assessed by applying it to three sites in the Himalaya, where debris-covered glaciers are widespread, with varying lithologic, glaciological and climatic settings, and encompassing different periods of the melt season. We develop the new methods keeping in mind the wide range of remote sensing platforms currently in use, and focus in particular on two products: we apply the three approaches at each site to near-contemporaneous atmospherically-corrected Pleiades (2 m resolution) and Sentinel-2 (10 m resolution) images and assess the effects of spatial and spectral resolution on the results. We find that the Spectral Curvature method works best for the high spatial resolution, four band Pleaides images, while a modification of the Linear Spectral Unmixing using the scaling factor of the unmixing is best for the coarser spatial resolution, but additional spectral information of Sentinel-2 products. In both cases ice cliffs are mapped with a Dice coefficient higher than 0.48. Comparison of the Pleiades results with other existing methods shows that the Spectral Curvature approach performs better and is more robust than any other existing automated or semi-automated approaches. Both methods outline a high number of small, sometimes shallow-sloping and thinly debris-covered ice patches that differ from our traditional understanding of cliffs but may have non-negligible impact on the mass balance of debris-covered glaciers. Overall these results pave the way for large scale efforts of ice cliff mapping that can enable inclusion of these features in debris-covered glacier melt models, as well as allow the generation of multiple datasets to study processes of cliff formation, evolution and decline.

AB Distribution patterns of lit fisheries in the South China Sea (SCS) were investigated using seasonally averaged nighttime light remote sensing data from 2016. Light-fishing activities clearly showed spatial and seasonal patterns and a newly developed "hotspot" with the presence of many intensive lights observed in the open ocean during spring. These satellite observations are consistent with seasonal changes in the fishing grounds of a Chinese large-sized, falling-net fishing fleet based on catch monitoring records for a typical commercial fishing vessel and Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) data from this fleet. Catch monitoring records show that this type of vessel operates both on the northern shelf and in the oceanic waters, with apparent seasonal fishing patterns in the SCS. Dominant catches on the shelf include Carangids, Trichiurus japonicus, and Loligo spp., while Sthenoteuthis oualaniensis and Auxis spp. overwhelm catches in the oceanic waters. Furthermore, we compared VMS and Day Night Band (DNB) data to study fishing behaviors of this type of vessel, including match rates between VMS and nightly satellite images and the DNB radiance characteristics of the vessels. This study is valuable for delineating squid fishing grounds in the open SCS and provides an important basis for differentiating light fishing vessels of China from those of other countries, which may be useful for detecting illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities. Findings of this study may also shed light on mitigating the emerging threat of light pollution to the local ecosystem of the SCS.

AB Soil moisture observations are of broad scientific interest and practical value for a wide range of applications. The scientific community has made significant progress in estimating soil moisture from satellite-based Earth observation data, particularly in operationalizing coarse-resolution (25-50 km) soil moisture products. This review summarizes existing applications of satellite-derived soil moisture products and identifies gaps between the characteristics of currently available soil moisture products and the application requirements from various disciplines. We discuss the efforts devoted to the generation of high-resolution soil moisture products from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data such as Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter observations and/or through downscaling of existing coarse-resolution microwave soil moisture products. Open issues and future opportunities of satellite-derived soil moisture are discussed, providing guidance for further development of operational soil moisture products and bridging the gap between the soil moisture user and supplier communities.

AB The point spread function (PSF) effect is ubiquitous in remote sensing images and imposes a fundamental uncertainty on subpixel mapping (SPM). The crucial PSF effect has been neglected in existing SPM methods. This paper proposes a general model to reduce the PSF effect in SPM. The model is applicable to any SPM methods treating spectral unmixing as pre-processing. To demonstrate the advantages of the new technique it was necessary to develop a new approach for accuracy assessment of SPM. To-date, accuracy assessment for SPM has been limited to subpixel classification accuracy, ignoring the performance of reproducing spatial structure in downscaling. In this paper, a new accuracy index is proposed which considers SPM performances in classification and restoration of spatial structure simultaneously. Experimental results show that by considering the PSF effect, more accurate SPM results were produced and small-sized patches and elongated features were restored more satisfactorily. Moreover, using the novel accuracy index, the quantitative evaluation was found to be more consistent with visual evaluation. This paper, thus, addresses directly two of the longest standing challenges in SPM (i.e., the limitations of the PSF effect and accuracy assessment undertaken only on a subpixel-by-subpixel basis).

AB Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne hyperspectral systems can acquire hyperspectral imagery with a high spatial resolution (which we refer to here as H2 imagery). As a result of the low operating cost, high flexibility, and the ability to achieve real-time data acquisition, UAV-borne hyperspectral systems have become an im-portant data source for remote sensing based agricultural monitoring. However, precise crop classification based on UAV-borne H2 imagery is a challenging task when faced with a number of different crop classes. The traditional hyperspectral classification methods, such as the spectral-based and object-oriented classification methods, have difficulty in classifying H2 imagery, faced with the problems of salt-and-pepper (SP) noise and scale selection. In this article, the deep convolutional neural network with a conditional random field classifier (CNNCRF) framework is proposed for precise crop classification with UAV-borne H2 imagery. In the proposed method, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract and fuse in-depth spectral and local spatial features, and the conditional random field (CRF) model further incorporates the spatial-contextual information to improve the problem of holes and isolated regions in the classification map. Meanwhile, virtual sample augmentation based on the hyperspectral imaging mechanism is used to lessen the issue of the limited labeled samples. To validate the results, a new dataset-the Wuhan UAV-borne hyperspectral image (WHU-Hi) dataset-has been built for precise crop classification. The experimental results obtained using the WHU-Hi dataset confirm the accuracy and visualization performance of the proposed CNNCRF classification method, which outperforms the previous methods. In addition, the WHU-Hi dataset could serve as a benchmark dataset for hyperspectral image classification studies.

AB Sentinel-1 is a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) platform with an operational mode called extra wide (EW) that offers large regions of ocean areas to be observed. A major issue with EW images is that the cross-polarized HV and VH channels have prominent additive noise patterns relative to low backscatter intensity, which disrupts tasks that require manual or automated interpretation. The European Space Agency (ESA) provides a method for removing the additive noise pattern by means of lookup tables, but applying them directly produces unsatisfactory results because characteristics of the noise still remain. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the magnitude of the additive noise dynamically depends on factors that are not considered by the ESA estimated noise field.
   To address these issues we propose a quadratic objective function to model the mis-scale of the provided noise field on an image. We consider a linear denoising model that re-scales the noise field for each subswath, whose parameters are found from a least-squares solution over the objective function. This method greatly reduces the presence of additive noise while not requiring a set of training images, is robust to heterogeneity in images, dynamically estimates parameters for each image, and finds parameters using a closed-form solution.
   Two experiments were performed to validate the proposed method. The first experiment simulated noise removal on a set of RADARSAT-2 images with noise fields artificially imposed on them. The second experiment conducted noise removal on a set of Sentinel-1 images taken over the five oceans. Afterwards, quality of the noise removal was evaluated based on the appearance of open-water. The two experiments indicate that the proposed method marks an improvement both visually and through numerical measures.

This is the first work evaluating the potential use of CALIOP for ocean applications at regional scale in mid-latitude regions (i.e. Mediterranean, MED, and Black Sea, BS) and investigating the added information on ocean particles given by the column integrated depolarization ratio (delta(T)) parameter. We implemented and refined a retrieval procedure to estimate this parameter at 1/4 degree of spatial resolution, comparing 7 years of CALIOP observations (2011-2017) to the corresponding Copernicus multi-sensor L3 ocean colour products of the surface particle backscattering coefficient (b(bp)) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a). This study pointed out that the current CALIOP sampling is inadequate to detect subtle day-night difference due to plankton diel variability for these basins. At a basin scale, delta(T) covaries with b(bp) for b(bp) >= 0.0015 m(-1). This is more evident for BS (R = 0.84) than for MED (R = 0.61). The analysis of seasonal distributions confirm this result for BS, where dT has a semi-annual cycle in very good agreement with bbp. In the MED, characterized by different trophic regimes, delta(T) shows also some similarities with Chl-a annual cycle. The combined characterization in the MED bioregions of the annual patterns of b(bp):Chl-a, delta(T):Chl-a and delta(T):b(bp) ratios suggested that delta(T) parameter can provide valuable information about the non-sphericity and the size of ocean particles.

AB Widely recognized as one of the worst natural disaster in Puerto Rico's history, hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20, 2017 in southeast Puerto Rico as a high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale causing widespread destruction, fatalities and forest disturbance. This study focused on hurricane Maria's effect on Puerto Rico's forests as well as the effect of landform and forest characteristics on observed disturbance patterns. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to assess the severity of forest disturbance using a disturbance metric based on Landsat 8 satellite data composites with pre and post-hurricane Maria. Forest structure, tree phenology characteristics, and landforms were obtained from satellite data products, including digital elevation model and global forest canopy height. Our analyses showed that forest structure, and characteristics such as forest age and forest type affected patterns of forest disturbance. Among forest types, highest disturbance values were found in sierra palm, transitional, and tall cloud forests; seasonal evergreen forests with coconut palm; and mangrove forests. For landforms, greatest disturbance metrics was found at high elevations, steeper slopes, and windward surfaces. As expected, high levels of disturbance were also found close to the hurricane track, with disturbance less severe as hurricane Maria moved inland. Results demonstrated that forest and landform characteristics accounted for 34% of the variation in spatial forest spectral disturbance patterns. This study demonstrated an informative regional approach, combining remote sensing with statistical analyses to investigate factors that result in variability in hurricane effects on forest ecosystems.

AB River ice monitoring is important for hydrological research and water resource management of the Tibetan Plateau but limited by the serious shortage of field observations, and remote sensing can be used as an effective supplementary means for monitoring river ice. However, remote sensing high-altitude river ice is scarce and a basin-scale understanding of river ice is lacking on the Tibetan Plateau. To ascertain the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of high-altitude river ice at the basin scale, we selected the Babao River basin as the study area, which is a typical river basin located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Utilizing 447 available Landsat images during the river ice period from 1999 to 2018 and the classical normalized difference snow index (NDSI) algorithm, we monitored the river ice in a long time series at the Babao River basin. The average Khat of accuracy validation reached 0.973. The average area of river ice in the river ice period of this basin showed a weak decreasing trend and was negatively correlated with air temperature. We also found that gentle slopes and high elevations are beneficial for the development of river ice. The melting of river ice supplements river discharge in spring. This study is the first to reveal the distribution characteristics and changing trend of river ice at the basin scale on the Tibetan Plateau, and the results provide a reference for river ice research in this region.

AB Forests are critical in regulating climate by altering the Earth's surface albedo. Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance our knowledge about the effects of forest structure on albedo. Here, we present a global assessment of the links between forest structure and albedo at a 1-km spatial resolution using generalized additive models (GAMs). We used remotely sensed data to obtain variables representing forest structure, including forest density, leaf area index, and tree cover, during the peak growing season in 2005 with pure forest pixels that cover similar to 7% of the Earth's surface. Furthermore, we estimated black-sky albedo at a solar zenith angle of 38 degrees using the most recent collection of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS; version 6) at shortwave, near-infrared, and visible spectral regions. In addition, for the first time, we mapped the magnitude of the relationship between forest structure and albedo at each pixel with a 0.5-degree spatial resolution. Our results suggested that forest structure may modulate albedo in most of the sub-biomes. The response of shortwave albedo was always positive to the leaf area index and negative to the tree cover (except for deciduous broadleaf forests in mediterranean and temperate regions), while the response to forest density varied across space in 2005. The spatial map affirmed that the links between forest structure and albedo vary over geographical locations. In sum, our study emphasized the importance of forest structure in the surface albedo regulation. This paper provides the first spatially explicit evidence of the magnitude of relationships between forest structure and albedo on a global scale.

AB There is an urgent need to include northern peatland hydrology in global Earth system models to better understand land-atmosphere interactions and sensitivities of peatland functions to climate change, and, ultimately, to improve climate change predictions. In this study, we introduced for the first time peatland-specific model physics into an assimilation scheme for L-band brightness temperature (Tb) data from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission to improve groundwater table estimates. We conducted two sets of model-only and data assimilation experiments using the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM), applying (over peatlands only) in one of them a peatland-specific adaptation (PEATCLSM). The evaluation against in-situ measurements of peatland groundwater table depth indicates the superiority of PEATCLSM model physics and additionally improved performance after assimilating SMOS Tb observations. The better performance of PEATCLSM over nearly all Northern Hemisphere peatlands is further supported by the better agreement between SMOS Tb observations and Tb estimates from the model-only and data assimilation runs. Within the data assimilation scheme, PEATCLSM reduces Tb observation-minus-forecast residuals and leads to reduced data assimilation updates of water storage components and, thus, reduced water budget imbalances in the assimilation system.

AB Knowledge of the status (position and speed) of flying aircraft is vital for efficient and safe air space management. However, this requirement is often compromised due to the complexity of the aviation environment. Satellite remote sensing (RS) provides a complementary means for tracing aircraft, but is often limited to finding motionless aircraft under specific scenarios (e.g., at airports). Here, based on the inter-band offsets due to hardware parallax in push-broom sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument or MSI), we develop a method for detecting flying aircraft in an automated fashion. Supported by a hybrid computation framework (based on Google Earth Engine computation and local computation) specifically designed to address the challenge of processing large volume of moderate resolution RS data at a global scale, the method is applied to more than 2.31 million MSI images to establish a map of the global distribution of flying aircraft. The detected flying aircraft coincide well with those determined using traditional techniques (e.g., Flightradar24), when both datasets co-exist. With the existing and future moderate-resolution data captured by push-broom satellite sensors, the method is believed to provide a robust and cost-effective means of detecting aircraft status at a global scale, thus supplementing the traditional methods for tracking flying aircraft. The same method is also used to estimate the inter-band and inter-granule time offsets in multi-band MSI and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, which may provide critical information needed to correct artifacts in aquatic applications.

TI Upscaling seasonal phenological course of leaf dorsiventral reflectance
   in radiative transfer model

AB Forest top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance observed by remote sensing instruments is driven by a wide range of parameters, including optical properties of leaves being the major driver, understory and bark together with structural properties of the forest - spatial distribution of leaves and branches in the canopy contributing also to variable extent. In addition, the instantaneous observation geometry (e.g. the sun and sensor zenith and azimuth angles) largely influences the observed TOC reflectance due to the changes in shadow fraction in the canopies. As a result, forest TOC reflectance is highly dynamic, following the seasonal patterns of optical and structural properties of vegetation.
   From the above-mentioned factors, the leaf optical properties are the most important. They hold an information on leaf biochemical (e.g. chlorophyll and carotenoid contents), water content and structural (e.g., leaf thickness, distribution of pigments within a leaf) properties at the leaf-level. Whereas biochemical effects on leaf reflectance are well understood, the role of dorsiventral asymmetry leaf internal structure on two-sided leaf optical properties has not been paid much attention, assuming equal optical properties on both leaf sides. However, the internal structure of a dorsiventral leaf is highly asymmetric often having different surface structure, tissue density and pigment distribution. Moreover, leaf optical properties are rarely measured during phenological development with high time resolution. Typically, studies focus on peak growing season neglecting the dynamic seasonal change of optical properties for broadleaved vegetation of temperate forests.
   In this study, we measured the seasonal course of leaf-level two-sided optical properties, biochemical and structural traits of five common broadleaved tree species of Central Europe (Betula pendula, Fagus sylvatica, Acer pseudoplatanus, Acer platanoides, and Sorbus aucuparia) with a typical dorsiventral, leaf anatomy without heliotropism. We link their leaf optical properties (e.g. reflectance difference of adaxial and abaxial sides, reflectance to transmittance ratio, fraction of specular component of leaf reflectance) with the laboratory analyses of inner leaf structure for contrasting leaf phenological stages from spring to fall. This allowed us to quantify both, species and seasonal differences of leaf dorsiventral optical properties and the role of inner leaf structure on leaf dorsiventral optical properties. Next, we up-scaled measured leaf-level dorsiventral optical properties to canopy level using Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer model (DART) for three contrasting seasonal phenological stages - early spring (day of the year; DOY 115), summer (DOY 212) and fall (DOY 285). The aim was to quantify the impact of leaf optical properties parametrization (i.e. assuming equal optical properties on both sides, or dorsiventral leaf optical properties asymmetry) for forest of different species composition, vegetation phenological stage and observation geometries. The biggest differences between simulations were observed in VIS and NIR regions, where the neglecting differences in abaxial side leaf reflectance may introduce relative difference up to 20%, causing the underestimation of "one-sided" scenario compared to "two-sided" one, especially for off-nadir backscattering viewing directions. This may lead to increase in uncertainty when interpreting remote sensing observations, namely the chlorophyll content retrievals from back-scattering observation geometries and canopy structural retrievals (e.g. leaf area index) for all viewing geometries. We, thus, suggest to account for leaf reflectance dorsiventral differences in the next generation of radiative transfer models.

AB We developed an algorithm called Cmask (Cirrus cloud mask) for cirrus cloud detection in Landsat 8 imagery using time series of Cirrus Band (1.36-1.39 mu m) observations. For each pixel, a harmonic model, which includes a water vapor regressor, based on all available Cirrus Band observations is estimated using the Robust Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (RIRLS) regression approach, and pixels affected by cirrus cloud are identified by comparing model predictions and actual satellite observations of the Cirrus Band Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of increasing Cirrus Band TOA reflectance on the surface reflectance of the Blue, Green, Red, Near Infrared (NIR), and two Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) (SWIR 1 and SWIR 2) Bands based on a set of globally distributed random samples. The goal of this study is to answer the question of what are cirrus clouds in the context of a Landsat observation, or more specifically, when should we identify a pixel as cirrus cloud such that we know the reflectance in the other spectral bands has been seriously affected by cirrus clouds. The challenge is to then develop a simple and operational algorithm for accurate detection of cirrus clouds in Landsat 8 images. The Cmask algorithm reduced almost by half the errors found in the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Quality Assessment (QA) Band for distinguishing cirrus cloud and clear observations (8% versus 15% error).

AB Terricolous macrolichens are an important food source for caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and can greatly influence their movement, distribution and demography over time. Mapping the spatial distribution and cover of macrolichens with remote sensing can serve as an important approach for assessing the impact of disturbances (e.g. fire, grazing, trampling) on lichen cover at the landscape scale and for monitoring post-disturbance rates of recovery. Previous remote sensing-based efforts to retrieve the distribution and abundance of lichen have been restricted to particular regions and thus are not indicative of the potential for large extent mapping and monitoring. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of machine learning methods for retrieving lichen cover and change across different regions in northern Canada and Alaska using Landsat-5 images, topographic and climate data. Global and regional-scale models were evaluated to assess whether regionally specific analyses would improve performance. Of the models tested, the deep neural network was the most accurate for predicting lichen cover (model efficiency (ME) = 0.58, mean absolute error (MAE) < 7%). For the regional analysis, the performance was the best in north-central Canada (ME = 0.56, MAE = 8%) and the worst in north-eastern Canada (ME = 0.22, MAE < 4%) due to lower lichen cover, more exposed ground, and reduced sample quality and distribution. Analysis of trend-based change detection from 1984 to 2011 in the three regional test areas showed the expected directional response with declining lichen cover in north-western Canada in response to climate-induced shrub expansion, slow recovery to wildfire in north-central Canada, and declining lichen cover in north-eastern Canada related to caribou foraging/trampling and shrub expansion.

AB Vegetation growth and physiological functioning, including carbon uptake and transpiration, can be strongly affected by drought. During water-limited conditions, urban vegetation may be limited in its ability to provide ecosystem services, such as shading and evaporative cooling. While there has been extensive research on drought response in natural vegetation and agricultural systems using remote sensing, drought impacts on urban vegetation have remained understudied. With > 50% of people worldwide living in cities and the increased potential for future droughts, it is important to understand how urban vegetation will respond and to evaluate potential impacts. Here, we used repeat flights of NASA airborne imaging spectroscopy (AVIRIS and AVIRIS-NG) to quantify the responses of common urban tree species and turfgrass in downtown Santa Barbara, California, USA to the 2012-2016 California drought. The effects of the drought on vegetation were quantified using several spectral indicators: fractional cover from multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), vegetation indices, and continuum removed absorption features. We used existing tree crown object polygons that were classified to species and had associated estimates of pre-drought leaf area index and biomass. We also included polygons of turfgrass parks and recreational fields. All tree species and turfgrass had four or more spectral indicators with significantly lower mean values (p < 0.05) during the drought in 2014, and evidence of recovery was observed for some species in 2017, which was after the drought had ended. In general, needleleaf and native trees were more affected than broadleaf and non-native trees, respectively, but with considerable interspecific variability. Based on the spectral indicators, turfgrass cover senesced in the middle of the drought but recovered soon after the drought ended, whereas the majority of tree species had not fully recovered. Mean green vegetation cover declined in most tree canopies during the drought, primarily exposing paved surfaces and/or non-photosynthetic vegetation, depending on the site type and tree patch size. Drought impacts as expressed in spectral indicators were generally more severe in tree patches with high pre-drought leaf area index, suggesting that denser, leafier canopies were more difficult for trees to maintain during the drought. Most spectral indicators were correlated with one another (R > 0.4), suggesting co-occuring adjustments of greenness, water content, and plant pigments.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been used to track vegetation photosynthetic activity for improving estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) and detecting plant stress. There are both physical and physiological controls of SIF measured at the surface and retrieved from remote sensing including satellite observations. In order to accurately use SIF for monitoring of plant physiology, the effects of physically-based radiation processes related to leaf and canopy structure, notably photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorption and SIF scattering and re-absorption, must be characterized. In this study, we investigate both PAR absorption and SIF scattering processes and find that although it is difficult to quantify their effects individually by using just reflectance, the combined effects of the two processes can be well approximated by a reflectance index. This index, referred to as FCVI (Fluorescence Correction Vegetation Index), is defined as the difference between near-infrared (NIR) and broad-band visible (VIS, 400-700 nm) reflectance acquired under identical sun-canopy-observer geometry of the SIF measurements. The development of the index was based on the physical connection between reflectance and far-red SIF, which was revealed by using the spectral invariant theory. The utility of FCVI to correct far-red SIF for PAR absorption and scattering effects, thus improving the link to photosynthesis, was tested with data from: (i) a field experiment for a growing season; and (ii) a numerical experiment which included a number of scenarios generated by a radiative transfer model. For both the observations and simulations, the FCVI provided a promising estimate of the impact of the physically-based radiation processes on far-red SIF of moderately dense canopies (i.e., FCVI >= 0.18). Normalizing the TOC far-red SIF by both the incident PAR (iPAR) and the FCVI provided a good estimate of the far-red fluorescence emission efficiency of the canopies examined. This approach enhances our ability to generalize retrievals for vegetation processes as they change through natural growth phases and seasons. Taken together, far-red SIF and FCVI may enable the assessment of the light partitioning of vegetation canopies, an essential step to facilitate the use of far-red SIF for tracking physiological processes.

Although previous efforts have achieved inspiring results, hyperspectral image (HSI) destriping remains a challenging task, as the stripe degradations are sometimes more complicated than the predefined assumptions, i.e., the preselected reference, filter, or handcrafted priors. With the rapid advances in deep learning technologies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provide a new potential to learn essential priors in an automatic manner. However, the training of CNNs is highly reliant on a large high-quality standard dataset, which is difficult to acquire for hyperspectral spaceborne sensors. In this paper, an innovative approach termed the satellite-ground integrated destriping network (SGIDN) is proposed for HSIs. Rather than using self-training, a satellite-ground integrated strategy is proposed, for the first time, to mitigate the data dependency, so that a large set of striped-clean pairs is generated from the ground-based HSIs. Considering the varied stripes among different bands, a unique CNN architecture design, including the combination of 3D convolution and 2D convolution, residual learning, and supplementary gradient channels, is integrated to capture the intrinsic spectral-spatial features in the HSIs and the unidirectional property of stripe noise. Compared with the traditional methods, SGIDN can be flexibly extended to specific HSI destriping tasks, e.g., coexisting horizontal and vertical stripes, and generalizes well to different hyperspectral satellite sensors. Given the same study area (Shanghai, China), three HSIs acquired by the EO-1 Hyperion imaging spectrometer, the Chinese HJ-1A HSI sensor, and the wide-range hyperspectral imager onboard the Chinese SPARK spectral micro-nano satellite are adopted to assess the proposed SGIDN model. Both simulated and real-data experiments confirm that SGIDN can consistently outperform the benchmark methods, with a higher degree of efficiency. Moreover, the land-cover mapping results further demonstrate the necessity of destriping and the suitability of the destriped results for use in further applications.

AB The polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) signal contains more parameters than single or dual polarized SAR when using a scattering matrix to characterize targets. The increased information content of PolSAR provides more potential inputs for machine learning and classification applications; however, polarimetric parameters tend to be simply used as input variables and the optimum parameters to efficiently separate land classes and their physical meaning has received little attention. This research application proposes a Multitemporal Binary-Tree Classification framework (MBTC) to identify and integrate optimum scattering parameters and machine learning methods in a meaningful way. First, the optimum scattering mechanism that most effectively distinguishes pairs of land classes is derived by a Lagrange multiplier. Next, for each pair of classes, machine learning classifiers are trained by the optimum scattering power ratio and elevated by Out-Of-Bag (OOB) cross validation. Three machine learning algorithms- Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Neutral Network (NN)- are investigated. Finally, a multi-temporal binary-tree classifier is constructed, in which each pair of land classes are distinguished by the optimized machine learning algorithms. Two independent study sites in Canada are used for evaluating the MBTC framework using RADARSAT-2 observations. The London site with 6 classes is used to analyze the optimum scattering mechanisms and execute a simple classification. The Carman site with 10 classes allows for an indepdent and comprehensive assessment of the MBTC by comparing against an advanced Model-Based Decomposition (MBD). At the London site, the MBTC achieves the maximum power ratio with the optimum scattering mechanism between each pair of classes and high overall accuracy (OA) of 91% and kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.9. At the Carman site, comparisons indicate that MBTC significantly outperforms the MBD with NN and SVM classifiers but has a similar accuracy to the MBD for RF classifier with OA of 85% and Kappa of 0.82. In cases with pairs of classes that are difficult to separate, such as barley and wheat, MBTC is shown to be superior in this research application.

AB There is a strong link between vegetation heterogeneity and biodiversity in grassland ecosystems. However, quantifying spatial patterns of key metrics, such as aboveground biomass, at landscape scales remains a challenge. This stems from difficulties in accurately estimating grassland biomass at fine scales over large areas and determining what spatial scale is most appropriate to monitor how grassland impacts (e.g., livestock grazing) affect spatial patterns of biomass (i.e., spatial heterogeneity). Here, we use lidar metrics (volume, max height, and intensity) in Random Forest models to quantify fine-resolution (pixel size 1.0668 m (3.5 ft)) aboveground biomass estimates (pseudo R-2 = 0.59; RMSD = 139.4 g m(-2)) across a bunchgrass prairie grassland system. To determine both the effects of grazing on the spatial heterogeneity of aboveground biomass and which pixel size is most sensitive to the effects of livestock grazing on grassland heterogeneity, we aggregated fine-resolution biomass maps to coarser pixel resolutions (3 m, 5 m, 8 m, 20 m, 30 m) across 23 pastures with varying levels of grazing intensity. Following aggregation to coarser pixel resolutions, we observed that semivariogram models produced statistically different (alpha = 0.05) measures of biomass heterogeneity. The range statistic was the only pasture-level semivariogram metric sensitive to grazing, and this relationship was only significant when using the finer-resolution datasets (similar to 1 m to 8 m pixels). Our results demonstrate 1) the applicability of lidar data for quantifying biomass in short-statured grasslands, 2) that grazing in pacific northwest bunchgrass prairie can decrease spatial heterogeneity of aboveground biomass and 3) that fine-resolution satellite data ( < 10 m pixel sizes) are necessary to effectively monitor the effects of grazing on the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation biomass, an indirect metric of biodiversity at management scales (pasture sizes ranged from 40 to 745 ha) in this grassland ecosystem.

AB The Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) collects multiple spectral band images, corresponding to specific sensing wavelengths and spatial resolutions, i.e. 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, respectively. Images are collected one at the time with a given time-lag between observations. Under favorable conditions, spatio-temporal characteristics of propagating ocean surface waves can thus uniquely be retrieved. A method for surface current vector field reconstruction is then developed. Demonstrated over different deep ocean regions, the retrieved surface current fields well compare with medium-resolution ocean circulation model or derived-velocities from altimeter measurements. At finer scales, the surface wave-conservation law is recovered, with the associated relationship between current vorticity and wave-ray curvature. Over shallow water regions, the wave propagation properties well follow sea depth variations, consistent with ETOPO1 data. Finally, time-lag between detector bands can also be exploited to estimate speed and direction properties of detected surface wave breaking whitecaps. An analysis of velocity reconstruction errors further reveals that Sentinel-2 MSI inter-channel co-registration is realized with an accuracy better than 0.1 pixel. Overall, these results confirm very promising capabilities of optical imagery to provide direct surface current velocity measurements from space, over relatively large areas, O(100 km), with a spatial resolution down to O(1 km).

AB Permafrost in Interior Alaska is protected against summer thaw by an insulating layer of moss and mixed vegetative cover that regulates seasonal thaw and the end-of-summer season permafrost active layer depth. Thaw depths are laborious point scale measurements that can be difficult to translate regionally. Since disturbances are present on the landscape across many temporal and spatial scales they can greatly affect the soil and vegetation regime. Furthermore, many areas are denied full assessment due to terrain complexity or limited accessibility. As such, a remotely sensed means for estimating surface thaw based on insular vegetation composition would be advantageous. A synoptic evaluation of this insulating layer could eventually benefit regional mapping of areas where vegetation cover helps regulate thaw depths during the local growing season. Herein, we present multi-year data collected from three terrain types in Interior Alaska that relates seasonal thaw depth to vegetative cover type. Field samples for spectral reflectance, vegetation, soil, elevation and seasonal thaw depths were obtained from surveyed 1 m(2) quadrats during the local growing season (late July, each summer from 2014 to 2017) across three lowland boreal landscapes. Statistical relationships between vegetation and samples were explored using CCA and showed vegetative cover distributions were highly correlated in two dimensions with the principal variables represented almost evenly by the soil variable pH and thaw depth. Class maps representing vegetation and associated thaw depth were derived from hyperspectral imagery using field and imagery training data. Map accuracy assessment, conducted using random points to establish truth data, yielded overall accuracies of > 85%. Regression analysis and root mean square error testing of the predictive capacity of the vegetation classes and thaw depth was variable but encouraging, ranging from 5 to 11 cm or between an 8 and 37% chance of error. We feel the results are strong enough to stimulate more study in the evaluation of vegetation and thaw depth mapping during the local growing season.

AB Accurate crop yield estimates are important for governments, farmers, scientists and agribusiness. This paper provides a novel demonstration of the use of freely available Sentinel-2 data to estimate within-field wheat yield variability in a single year. The impact of data resolution and availability on yield estimation is explored using different combinations of input data. This was achieved by combining Sentinel-2 with environmental data (e.g. meteorological, topographical, soil moisture) for different periods throughout the growing season. Yield was estimated using Random Forest (RF) regression models. They were trained and validated using a dataset containing over 8000 points collected by combine harvester yield monitors from 39 wheat fields in the UK. The results demonstrate that it is possible to produce accurate maps of within-field yield variation at 10 m resolution using Sentinel-2 data (RMSE 0.66 t/ha). When combined with environmental data further improvements in accuracy can be obtained (RMSE 0.61 t/ha). We demonstrate that with knowledge of crop-type distribution it is possible to use these models, trained with data from a few fields, to estimate within-field yield variability on a landscape scale. Applying this method gives us a range of crop yield across the landscape of 4.09 to 12.22 t/ha, with a total crop production of approx. 289,000 t.

AB The trophic state index (TSI) is a vital parameter for aquatic ecosystem assessment. Thus, information on the spatial and temporal distribution of TSI is critical for supporting scientifically sound water resource management decisions. We proposed a semi-analytical approach to remotely estimate TSI based on Landsat 8 OLI data for inland waters. The approach has two major steps: deriving the total absorption coefficient of optically active constituents (OACs) and building the relationship between the total absorption coefficient and TSI. First, version 6.0 of the Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA_V6, developed by Zhongping Lee) was implemented with Landsat 8 OLI data to derive the total absorption coefficients of the 'OACs. Second, we modeled TSI using the total absorption coefficients of OACs at 440 nm based on a large in situ measurement dataset. The total absorption coefficient of OACs at 440 nm gave satisfactory validation results for modeling TSI with a mean absolute percent error of 6% and a root-mean-square error of 5.77. Then, we performed this approach in three inland waters with various eutrophic statuses to validate its results, and the approach demonstrated a robust and satisfactory performance. Finally, an application of the approach was demonstrated in Lake Qiandaohu. Our semi-analytical approach has a sound optical mechanism and extensive application for different trophic inland waters.

AB Changes in vegetation phenology are among the most sensitive biological responses to global change. While land surface phenological changes in the Northern Hemisphere have been extensively studied from the widely used long-term AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data, current knowledge on land surface phenological trends and the associated drivers remains uncertain for the tropics. This uncertainty is partly due to the well-known challenges of applying satellite-derived vegetation indices from the optical domain in areas prone to frequent cloud cover. The long-term vegetation optical depth (VOD) product from satellite passive microwaves features less sensitivity to atmospheric perturbations and measures different vegetation traits and functioning as compared to optical sensors. VOD thereby provides an independent and complementary data source for studying land surface phonology and here we performed a combined analysis of the VOD and AVHRR NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets for the dry tropics (25 degrees N to 25 degrees S) during 1992-2012. We find a general delay in the VOD derived start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS) as compared to NDVI derived metrics, however with clear differences among land cover and continents. Pixels characterized by significant phenological trends (P < 0.05) account for up to 20% of the study area for each phenological metric of NDVI and VOD, with large spatial difference between the two sensor systems. About 50% of the pixels studied show significant phonological changes in either VOD or NDVI metrics. Drivers of phonological changes were assessed for pixels of high agreement between VOD and NDVI phenological metrics (serving as a means of reducing noise-related uncertainty). We find rainfall variability and woody vegetation change to be the main forcing variables of phenological trends for most of the dry tropical biomes, while fire events and land cover change are recognized as second-order drivers. Taken together, our study provides new insights on land surface phonological changes and the associated drivers in the dry tropics, as based on the complementary long-term data sources of VOD and NDVI, sensitive to changes in vegetation water content and greenness, respectively.

AB Nordenskiold Land in Central Spitsbergen, Svalbard is characterized as a high latitude, high relief periglacial landscape with permafrost occurring both in mountains and lowlands. Freezing and thawing of the active layer causes seasonal frost heave and thaw subsidence, while permafrost-related mass-wasting processes induce downslope ground displacements on valley sides. Displacement rate varies spatially and temporally depending on environmental factors. In our study, we apply Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to investigate the magnitude, spatial distribution and timing of seasonal ground displacements in and around Adventdalen using TerraSAR-X StripMap Mode (2009-2017) and Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath Mode (2015-2017) SAR images. First, we show that InSAR results from both sensors highlight consistent patterns and provide a comprehensive overview of the distribution of displacement rates. Secondly, two-dimensional (2D) TerraSAR-X InSAR results from combined ascending and descending geometries document the spatial variability of the vertical and east-west horizontal displacement rates for an average of nine thawing seasons. The remote sensing results are compared to a simplified geomorphological map enabling the identification of specific magnitudes and orientations of displacements for 14 selected geomorphological units. Finally, June to December 2017 6-day sampling interval Sentinel-1 time series was retrieved and compared to active layer ground temperatures from two boreholes. The timing of the subsidence and heave detected by InSAR matches the thawing and freeze-back periods measured by in-situ sensors. Our results highlight the value of InSAR to obtain landscape scale knowledge about the seasonal dynamics of complex periglacial environments.

AB Australia has experienced a large frequency of hydroclimatic events since the early 21st century, with multiple large-scale droughts and flooding rains exerting dramatic impacts on water resources and ecosystems. Despite these pronounced consequences, the coupling of ecosystem functioning to extreme climate variability remains elusive due to the lack of complete understanding of hydrological connections. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal trends of Australia's hydrological and vegetation responses to three climate modes: El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean dipole and the Southern Annular Mode, utilizing climate indices, satellite-derived total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE, precipitation from TRMM and vegetation greenness from MODIS. Using partial cross-correlation and vegetation sensitivity analyses to interpret the interactions among climate modes, water resources and vegetation across Australia, three hydroclimatic extreme events from 2002 to 2017 were analyzed: (i) a prolonged drought (2002-09, colloquially known as the 'big dry'); (ii) a dramatic wet pulse (2010-11, the 'big wet'); and (iii) another anomalous El Nino event (2015).
   Our results showed the entire continent partitioned into three geographic zones with diverse drying and wetting trends in total water storage, precipitation and vegetation greenness, reflecting varying and fundamental influences from the individual climate modes. Ecosystem productivity was found to be better related and more sensitive to TWSA than precipitation across different hydroclimate zones and during both extreme dry and wet conditions. We also observed TWSA increased rapidly during wet extremes, and these gains in water resources persisted for an additional four years (i.e., TWSA remained positive until 2015 following the 2011 'big wet'). Lastly, findings from another hydroclimatic event (the 2015 El Nino drought) further confirmed the relationships among climate, water and ecosystems, demonstrating the feasibility of predicting ecohydrological implications of future hydroclimatic extremes in Australia.

AB As an important part of the anthropogenic aerosol, Black Carbon (BC) aerosols in the atmospheric environment have strong impacts on climate change. Recently, most remote sensing studies on aerosol components detection are limited to the inversion of aerosol optical properties, integration of chemistry models or in situ observations. In this paper, an algorithm based on Effective Medium Approximations (EMA) and statistically optimized aerosol inversion algorithm was integrated for retrieving the surface mass concentration of BC aerosols from satellite signals. The sensitivity analyses for the developed forward model proved that the volume fraction of vertical BC is sensitive to the satellite observations and significantly improved especially over bright surface targets or under polluted atmospheric conditions. By updating the forward model and retrieved parameters of the statistically optimized inversion algorithm, three cases of high aerosol loading days were retrieved from Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectance for Atmospheric Sciences Coupled with Observations from a LiDAR (PARASOL) measurements, which shows a significant ability of BC aerosol detection. Additionally, the validation and closure studies of BC concentration retrievals also indicates an encouraging consistency with correlation (R) of 0.71, mean bias of 3.55, and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.75 when compared against the in-situ observations over South Asia. The accuracy of the retrievals also demonstrates different trends under different levels of aerosol loadings, which shows a higher accuracy in biomass burning seasons (R = 0.75, RMSE = 4.04, Bias = 3.27) while exaggerates the results in the case of clear conditions (R = 0.47, RMSE = 4.83, Bias = 4.00). Finally, the uncertainties of three assumptions, including proposing uniform vertical profile for BC, neglecting light-absorbing aerosols and using spherical EMA models were discussed in our manuscript. The maximum standard deviations caused by these uncertainties on low BC aerosol volume fractions (f(BC) < 1%) are 0.8%, 0.35% and 0.2% while these deviations will change to 0.25%, 0.05% and 1.5% respectively under higher BC fractions (f(BC) > 5%). This conclusion confirmed that the proposed algorithm for BC surface concentration retrieval extends the application of satellite remote sensing in monitoring the extreme biomass burning pollution.

AB The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite can no longer directly deliver high-resolution (9 km) soil moisture products with the failure of the onboard L-band radar. Thus, an appropriate replacement sensor and new algorithms are urgently needed to compensate for the lost radar and estimate soil moisture at high-resolution. This paper presents a new downscaling approach, the Downscaling basEd oN gradient boosting deciSion trEe (DENSE) method to solve this problem. We analyzed 26 soil moisture related indices, derived from MODIS and a digital elevation model, to identify proxy variables for soil moisture variability. A gradient boosting decision tree regression links the aggregated soil moisture proxies and SMAP observations at a coarse scale to express the nonlinear relationships between them. High-resolution soil moisture products were generated by applying this built regression model to the optimal soil moisture proxies at a fine scale over the entire Tibetan Plateau during the years 2015-2017. In situ measurements were collected from the Ngari, Naqu, and Maqu networks, which represent different climatic and vegetation conditions. We evaluated the downscaled soil moisture against ground observations at the daily, point, and network scales. The results indicated that the DENSE method effectively infers the spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture; and at the same time, preserves SMAP soil moisture accuracy. The performance of the proposed method failed in the Maqu network as this area is covered by dense vegetation. Although further improvements are still needed to correct vegetation effects, nevertheless, the DENSE method improved the spatial resolution of SMAP soil moisture estimates, from 36 km to 1 km over the Tibetan plateau where high-resolution soil moisture products are necessary to support local and global hydrological applications.

AB Soil moisture (SM) is a key state variable in understanding the climate system through its control on the land surface energy, water budget partitioning, and the carbon cycle. Monitoring SM at regional scale has become possible thanks to microwave remote sensing. In the past two decades, several satellites were launched carrying on board either radiometer (passive) or radar (active) or both sensors in different frequency bands with various spatial and temporal resolutions. Soil moisture algorithms are in rapid development and their improvements/revisions are ongoing. The latest SM retrieval products and versions of products that have been recently released are not yet, to our knowledge, comprehensively evaluated and inter-compared over different ecoregions and climate conditions. The aim of this paper is to comprehensively evaluate the most recent microwave-based SM retrieval products available from NASA's (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellite, ESA's led mission (European Space Agency) SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite, ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) sensor on board the meteorological operational (Metop) platforms Metop-A and Metop-B, and the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) blended long-term SM time series. More specifically, in this study we compared SMAPL3 V4, SMOSL3 V300, SMOSL2 V650, ASCAT H111, and CCI V04.2 and the new SMOS-IC (V105) SM product. This evaluation was achieved using four statistical scores: Pearson correlation (considering both original observations and anomalies), RMSE, unbiased RMSE, and Bias between remotely-sensed SM retrievals and ground-based measurements from > 1000 stations from 17 monitoring networks, spread over the globe, disseminated through the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The analysis reveals that the performance of the remotely-sensed SM retrievals generally varies depending on ecoregions, land cover types, climate conditions, and between the monitoring networks. It also reveals that temporal sampling of the data, the frequency of data in time and the spatial coverage, affect the performance metrics. Overall, the performance of SMAP and SMOS-IC products compared slightly better with respect to the ISMN in situ observations than the other remotely-sensed products.

AB Identification of water pixels over natural water bodies is a prerequisite step prior to applying algorithms dedicated to the estimation of bio-optical properties of surface waters from remote sensing observations. For visible remote sensing sensors, clouds affect the quantity and quality of the observations, directly by hiding part of the scene and indirectly by their shadows. A certain level of confusion could occur for detection of clouds over turbid (i.e. bright) waters and for detection of their shadows over any kind of surface water. Some algorithms exist but their performance is not satisfactory, especially over turbid waters where cloud-free pixels are sometimes classified as cloud or land, leading to a loss of data. This is particularly important for medium spatial resolution observations such as those performed by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor on Landsat-8 or the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) on Sentinel-2 (a and b). In the frame of this study, we developed a two-step algorithm for the extraction of water pixels (referred to as WiPE) for these medium spatial resolution sensors. In contrast to other approaches based on the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, this algorithm uses the Rayleigh-corrected TOA reflectance (rho(rc)(lambda)) as input parameter allowing the spectral signature of each object to be better characterized. The first step, based on the rho(rc)(lambda) spectral shape analysis of each object, allows water pixels to be discriminated from cloud, vegetation, barren land, and constructions pixels. The second step, in which the rho(rc)(lambda) spectra are transferred into the Hue-Saturation-Value space, greatly improves the detection of cloud shadow over waters. This second step, based on the processing of the whole image, does not require any knowledge on the location and altitude of clouds. Thin clouds are identified during the two steps of the algorithm. This algorithm has been successfully tested over a broad range of environments. WiPE, specifically designed for the extraction of water pixels, generally shows better performance over turbid waters than the standard algorithm developed for Landsat imagery (Fmask). This is explained by the fact that Fmask does not specifically focus on the detection of water pixels, but on the masking of cloud, cloud shadow, and snow over land and water.

AB Accurate quantification of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) is essential to understand the Earth's energy and water budgets under climate change. However, despite water and carbon cycle coupling, there are few diagnostic global evapotranspiration models that have complete carbon constraint on water flux run at a high spatial resolution. Here we estimate 8-day global ET and gross primary production (GPP) at 500 m resolution from July 2002 to December 2017 using a coupled diagnostic biophysical model (called PML-V2) that, built using Google Earth Engine, takes MODIS data (leaf area index, albedo, and emissivity) together with GLDAS meteorological forcing data as model inputs. PML-V2 is well calibrated against 8-day measurements at 95 widely-distributed flux towers for 10 plant functional types, indicated by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Bias being 0.69 min d(-1) and -1.8% for ET respectively, and being 1.99 g C m(-2) d(-1) and 4.2% for GPP. Compared to that performance, the cross-validation results are slightly degraded, with RMSE and Bias being 0.73 mm d(-1) and -3% for ET, and 2.13 g C m(-2) d(-1) and 3.3% for GPP, which indicates robust model performance. The PML-V2 products are noticeably better than most GPP and ET products that have a similar spatial resolution, and suitable for assessing the influence of carbon-induced impacts on ET. Our estimates show that global ET and GPP both significantly (p < 0.05) increased over the past 15 years. Our results demonstrate it is very promising to use the coupled PML-V2 model to improve estimates of GPP, ET and water use efficiency, and its uncertainty can be further reduced by improving model inputs, model structure and parameterisation schemes.

AB We present an independent validation of the satellite surface velocity fields released by the ESA Data User Element GlobCurrent Project. The validation methodology is based on the analysis of Lagrangian numerical trajectories integrated from satellite-based sea surface currents. Two case studies were considered: Mediterranean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean. The Finite-Scale Lyapunov Exponents provide a rigorous, quantitative tool to evaluate Lagrangian simulations with respect to real drifter trajectories. An accuracy threshold scale can be identified as the scale above which the error size, propagating along a numerical trajectory, grows no faster than the relative separation between real drifters. Below this threshold, the error growth rate tends to diverge linearly as the error decreases. The mean error growth speed, at early stage, is found to be related to the kinetic energy of the missing scales of motion, not resolved by the GlobCurrent products. Established kinematic Lagrangian models are, also, exploited to compensate the energy gap between real and numerical trajectories in the unresolved scale range. Ultimately, GlobCurrent surface velocity fields are shown to have overall good 'Lagrangian skills' for large-scale transport and dispersion numerical simulations.

AB Seventeen years (1998-2014) of satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration (Chl) are used to analyse the seasonal and non-seasonal patterns of Chl variability and the long-term trends in phytoplankton phenology in the Mediterranean Sea. With marked regional variations, we observe that seasonality dominates variability representing up to 80% of total Chl variance in oceanic areas, whereas in shelf-sea regions high frequency variations may be dominant representing up to 49% of total Chl variance. Seasonal variations are typically characterized by a phytoplankton growing period occurring in spring and spanning on average 170 days in the western basin and 150 days in the eastern basin. The variations in peak Chl concentrations are higher in the western basin (0.88 +/- 1.01 mg m(-3)) compared to the eastern basin (0.35 +/- 1.36 mg m(-3)). Differences in the seasonal cycle of Chl are also observed between open ocean and coastal waters where more than one phytoplankton growing period are frequent (> 0.8 probability). During the study period, on average in the western Mediterranean basin (based on significant trends observed over similar to 95% of the basin), we show a positive trend in Chl of +0.015 +/- 0.016 mg m(-3) decade(-1), and an increase in the amplitude and duration of the phytoplankton growing period by +0.27 +/- 0.29 mg m(-3) decade(-1) and +11 +/- 7 days decade(-1) respectively. Changes in Chl concentration in the eastern (and more oligotrophic) basin are generally low, with a trend of -0.004 +/- 0.024 mg m(-3) decade(-1) on average (based on observed significant trends over similar to 70% of the basin). In this basin, the Chl peak has declined by -0.03 +/- 0.08 mg m(-3) decade(-1) and the growing period duration has decreased by -12 +/- 7 days decade(-1). The trends in phytoplankton Chl and phenology, estimated in this study over the period 1998-2014, do not reveal significant overall decline/increase in Chl concentration or earlier/delayed timings of the seasonal peak on average over the entire Mediterranean Sea basin. However, we observed large regional variations, suggesting that the response of phytoplankton to environmental and climate forcing may be complex and regionally driven.

AB The nighttime light (NTL) observations from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescane System (DMSP/OLS) offer great potentials to study urban dynamics from regional to global scales, for more than two decades. In this paper, we presented a new approach to develop spatially and temporally consistent global urban maps from 1992 to 2013, using the DMSP/OLS NTL observations. First, potential urban clusters were delineated using the NTL data and a segmentation method. Then, a quantile-based approach was used to remove rural and suburban areas sequentially in the potential urban clusters. Finally, the derived series of urban extents in the entire study period (1992-2013) were improved for temporal consistency. We found the percentage of global urban areas relative to the world's land surface area increased from 0.23% in 1992 to 0.53% in 2013. Asia is the continent with the most significant urban growth, worldwide. The time series of global urban maps were evaluated for the spatial agreement and temporal consistency using a variety of widely used independent land-cover products. This evaluation indicates that the proposed approach is robust and performs well in deriving global urban dynamics across different spatial scales, i.e., cluster, province (or state), country, and region. Moreover, this quantile-based approach is advantageous, compared with other methods used in previous studies, because it does not require additional data for enhancement or calibration. The new time series of urban maps from this study offer a new dataset for studying global urbanization during the past decades and unique information to explore potential future trajectories of urban development, which appears to be distinct for different nations/regions, globally. Such information is pre-requisite for achieving the sustainable development goals, and associated targets, during ensuing decades.

AB This paper introduces a modular processing chain to derive global high-resolution maps of leaf traits. In particular, we present global maps at 500 m resolution of specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content per dry mass, and leaf nitrogen/phosphorus ratio. The processing chain exploits machine learning techniques along with optical remote sensing data (MODIS/Landsat) and climate data for gap filling and up-scaling of in-situ measured leaf traits. The chain first uses random forests regression with surrogates to fill gaps in the database (> 45% of missing entries) and maximizes the global representativeness of the trait dataset. Plant species are then aggregated to Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Next, the spatial abundance of PFTs at MODIS resolution (500 m) is calculated using Landsat data (30 m). Based on these PFT abundances, representative trait values are calculated for MODIS pixels with nearby trait data. Finally, different regression algorithms are applied to globally predict trait estimates from these MODIS pixels using remote sensing and climate data. The methods were compared in terms of precision, robustness and efficiency. The best model (random forests regression) shows good precision (normalized RMSE <= 20%) and goodness of fit (averaged Pearson's correlation R = 0.78) in any considered trait. Along with the estimated global maps of leaf traits, we provide associated uncertainty estimates derived from the regression models. The process chain is modular, and can easily accommodate new traits, data streams (traits databases and remote sensing data), and methods. The machine learning techniques applied allow attribution of information gain to data input and thus provide the opportunity to understand trait-environment relationships at the plant and ecosystem scales. The new data products the gap-filled trait matrix, a global map of PFT abundance per MODIS gridcells and the high-resolution global leaf trait maps are complementary to existing large-scale observations of the land surface and we therefore anticipate substantial contributions to advances in quantifying, understanding and prediction of the Earth system.

AB Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is an emission of light in the 650-850 nm spectral range from the excited state of the chlorophyll-a pigment after absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). As this is directly linked to the electron transport chain in oxygenic photosynthesis, SIF is a powerful proxy for photosynthetic activity. SIF observations are relatively new and, while global scale measurements from satellites using high-resolution spectroscopy of Fraunhofer bands are becoming more available, observations at the intermediate canopy scale using these techniques are sparse.
   We present a novel ground-based spectrometer system - PhotoSpec - for measuring SIF in the red (670-732 nm) and far-red (729-784 nm) wavelength range as well as canopy reflectance (400-900 nm) to calculate vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI). PhotoSpec includes a 2D scanning telescope unit which can be pointed to any location in a canopy with a narrow field of view (FOV = 0.7 degrees) PhotoSpec has a high signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution, which allows high precision solar Fraunhofer line retrievals over the entire fluorescence wavelength range under all atmospheric conditions using a new two-step linearized least-squares retrieval procedure.
   Initial PhotoSpec observations include the diurnal SIF cycle of single broad leaves, grass, and dark-light transitions. Results from the first tower-based measurements in Costa Rica show that the instrument can continuously monitor SIF of several tropical species throughout the day. The PhotoSpec instrument can be used to explore the relationship between SIF, photosynthetic efficiencies, Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), and the impact of canopy radiative transfer, viewing geometry, and stress conditions at the canopy scale.

AB Conserving multiple facets of biodiversity is important for sustaining ecosystems. However, understanding relationships between faunal diversity and measurable ecosystem quantities, such as heterogeneity and productivity, across continental scales can be complicated by disparate methods. We developed standardized approaches using lidar data and spectral greenness data (via NOVI; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from 637 sampling plots across four sites in North America, Europe, and Asia to test the local effects of habitat heterogeneity and productivity on taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of breeding bird assemblages using boosted generalized additive models. Our results revealed the 3-D (three dimensional) vegetation structure (horizontal and vertical) to be of similar importance as NDVI in multiple biodiversity measures, and the importance of 3-D structure was higher for functional and phylogenetic biodiversity measures than for taxonomic measures. We found congruent responses between functional and phylogenetic diversity; however, patterns of taxonomic diversity differed from those of functional/phylogenetic diversity for most predictors. For example, NDVI had positive relationships with taxonomic diversity, but negative relationships with functional/ phylogenetic diversity. The effect of canopy density on taxonomic diversity was generally bell-shaped, whereas the relationship was U-shaped for functional and phylogenetic diversity. As a result, this study supports a silviculture strategy with a high variety of canopy densities and vertical variabilities across forest stands to create maximum benefits for regional biodiversity. Here, early succession stands and closed stands sustain functionally-rich bird assemblages, while stands with a medium canopy density promote species-rich assemblages.

AB Satellite altimetry is an important tool for monitoring water levels over oceans and inland water bodies, particularly over poorly gauged or ungauged areas. This study uses satellite altimetry (Jason-2/3 and Envisat) to derive water levels of the Great Brahmaputra River (GBR) originating from the Tibetan Plateau. Although the width of the river channels of the Lower Brahmaputra River (LBR) is similar to 1 km, the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR) (which is part of the Yarlung Zangbo River of China) and the Middle Brahmaputra River (MBR) located in high-mountain regions have river widths that are generally less than 400 m. This poses considerable challenges for existing retracking algorithms to obtain accurately retrieved water levels. In this study, an improved approach for deriving water levels in high-mountain regions with complex terrain is proposed, comprising (1) an improved footprint selection and (2) an improved waveform retracking, called the 50% Threshold and Ice-1 Combined algorithm (TIC). It was applied to river channels of varying widths, ranging from 200 m in the UBR to more than 1 km in the LBR. Results show an increase in both the accuracy and sampling of water levels. Most of the derived water levels at 13 virtual stations (VSs) along the GBR agree reasonably well with gauged water levels (for VSs in the UBR) or published results (for VSs in the LBR). The standard deviation of the difference between the TIC-derived water levels and gauged data at the VSs ranges from 0.3 m to 0.8 m with the highest improvement percentage relative to the unretracked ranges reaching 80% in the UBR. In addition, the developed approach increases water level sampling by reasonably demarcating the buffer zone for footprint selection, thereby generating more water levels in the time series than the published results for VSs in the LBR. However, 3 out of the 13 virtual stations show poor performance for Envisat, primarily due to the extremely narrow river channels. Furthermore, TIC can potentially be applied to estimate water levels near ground tracks of altimetric missions, even where there is no crossover between the river and the track. It could also be applied to other altimetric missions, which would further contribute to monitoring water levels and potentially river discharge in high-mountain regions with narrow river channels.

AB Earth Observation (EO) data are used to map mostly affected urban areas after an earthquake generally exploiting change detection techniques applied at pixel scale. However, Civil Protection Services require damage assessment of each building according to a well-established scale to manage rescue operations and to estimate the economic losses.
   Considering the earthquake that hit L'Aquila city (Italy) on April 6, 2009, this work assess the feasibility of producing damage maps at the scale of single building from Very High Resolution (VHR) optical images collected before and after the seismic event. We considered the European Macroseismic Scale 1998 (EMS-98) and assessed the possibility to discriminate between collapsed or heavy damaged buildings (damage grade DG equal to 5 in the EMS-98 scale) and less damaged or undamaged buildings (DG < 5 in the EMS-98).
   The proposed approach relies on a pre-existing urban map to identify image objects corresponding to building footprints. The image analysis is carried out according to many different parameters with the objective of assessing their effectiveness in singling out changes associated to the building collapse. Features describing texture and colour changes, as well statistical similarity and correlation descriptors, such as the Kullbach Leibler Distance and the Mutual Information, were included in our analysis. Two supervised classification approaches, respectively, based on the use of the Bayesian Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) criterion and on Support Vector Machines (SVM), were compared. In our experiment, we considered the whole L'Aquila historical centre comparing classification results with the ground survey performed by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV).
   The work represents one of the first attempt to detect damage at the scale of single building, validated against an extensive ground survey. It addresses methodological aspects, highlighting the potential of textural features computed at object scale and SVMs, and discuss potential and limitations of EO in this field compared to ground surveys.

AB In-situ field measurements of sample plots are a major cost component in airborne laser scanning (ALS) based forest inventories. Field measurements on new inventory areas can be reduced by utilizing existing stand attribute models from former inventory areas. We constructed a nationwide model for stem volume, and examined seven different calibration scenarios using 22 inventory areas distributed evenly throughout Finland. These scenarios can be divided into three main categories: 1) calibration with additional predictor variables, 2) calibration with 200 geographically nearest sample plots, and 3) calibration with MS-NFI (Multi-source National Forest Inventory of Finland) volume at the target inventory area. Calibration with degree days, precipitation, and proportion of birch resulted in the greatest decrease in error rate of stem volume predictions. The mean of the root mean square errors (RMSE) among the 22 inventory areas decreased from 28.6% to 25.9%, and the standard deviation of RMSEs from 4.3% to 3.9% using three additional predictor variables. Correspondingly, the mean and standard deviation of absolute values of mean differences (IMD I) decreased from 8.3% to 5.6% and from 5.6% to 4.4%, respectively. All calibration scenarios decreased the error rate, especially the high I MDs I observed in the northern part of Finland. Calibration with sample plots from geographically nearest inventory areas was useful when there were sample plots that offered a good representation of the target area. MS-NFI based calibration was also a reasonable option if loggings and other inconsistencies between datasets could be detected and accounted for.

AB Maps that categorise the landscape into discrete units are a cornerstone of many scientific, management and conservation activities. The accuracy of these maps is often the primary piece of information used to make decisions about the mapping process or judge the quality of the final map. Variance is critical information when considering map accuracy, yet commonly reported accuracy metrics often do not provide that information. Various resampling frameworks have been proposed and shown to reconcile this issue, but have had limited uptake. In this paper, we compare the traditional approach of a single split of data into a training set (for classification) and test set (for accuracy assessment), to a resampling framework where the classification and accuracy assessment are repeated many times. Using a relatively simple vegetation mapping example and two common classifiers (maximum likelihood and random forest), we compare variance in mapped area estimates and accuracy assessment metrics (overall accuracy, kappa, user, producer, entropy, purity, quantity/allocation disagreement). Input field data points were repeatedly split into training and test sets via bootstrapping, Monte Carlo cross-validation (67:33 and 80:20 split ratios) and k-fold (5-fold) cross-validation. Additionally, within the cross-validation, we tested four designs: simple random, block hold-out, stratification by class, and stratification by both class and space. A classification was performed for every split of every methodological combination (100's iterations each), creating sampling distributions for the mapped area of each class and the accuracy metrics. We found that regardless of resampling design, a single split of data into training and test sets results in a large variance in estimates of accuracy and mapped area. In the worst case, overall accuracy varied between similar to 40-80% in one resampling design, due only to random variation in partitioning into training and test sets. On the other hand, we found that all resampling procedures provided accurate estimates of error, and that they can also provide confidence intervals that are informative about the performance and uncertainty of the classifier. Importantly, we show that these confidence intervals commonly encompassed the magnitudes of increase or decrease in accuracy that are often cited in literature as justification for methodological or sampling design choices. We also show how a resampling approach enables generation of spatially continuous maps of classification uncertainty. Based on our results, we make recommendations about which resampling design to use and how it could be implemented. We also provide a fully worked mapping example, which includes traditional inference of uncertainty from the error matrix and provides examples for presenting the final map and its accuracy.

ID VALIDATION
AB Positive vertical bias in elevation data derived from NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) is known to cause substantial underestimation of coastal flood risks and exposure. Previous attempts to correct SRTM elevations have used regression to predict vertical error from a small number of auxiliary data products, but these efforts have been focused on reducing error introduced solely by vegetative land cover. Here, we employ a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network to perform a 23-dimensional vertical error regression analyses, where in addition to vegetation cover indices, we use variables including neighborhood elevation values, population density, land slope, and local SRTM deviations from ICESat altitude observations. Using lidar data as ground truth, we train the neural network on samples of US data from 1-20 m of elevation according to SRTM, and assess outputs with extensive testing sets in the US and Australia. Our adjustment system reduces mean vertical bias in the coastal US from 3.67 m to less than 0.01 m, and in Australia from 2.49 m to 0.11 m. RMSE is cut by roughly one-half at both locations, from 5.36 m to 2.39 m in the US, and from 4.15 m to 2.46 in Australia. Using ICESat data as a reference, we estimate that global bias falls from 1.88 m to -0.29 m, and RMSE from 4.28 m and 3.08 m. The methods presented here are flexible and effective, and can be effectively applied to land cover of all types, including dense urban development. The resulting enhanced global coastal DEM (CoastalDEM) promises to greatly improve the accuracy of sea level rise and coastal flood analyses worldwide.

AB Deriving inherent optical properties (IOPs) and other water quality parameters from satellite remote sensing data covering optically shallow environments has historically been problematic due to difficulties in separating the benthic signal from that of the water column. While recent advances have improved such retrievals, most methods have high uncertainties for very shallow (< 5 m) or very bright (e.g., carbonate sand) targets. Here, we present a two-stage process to improve IOP derivations from satellite-derived reflectance data, termed the Shallow Water Optimization with Resolved Depth (SWORD). Within this process, a raster bathymetry is first derived through multiple pixel-wise implementations of a spectral matching algorithm on mapped reflectance data. This bathymetry is then used as a fixed input in subsequent implementations of the algorithm, leading to improved IOP retrievals. The SWORD approach was developed and tested using a dataset of simulated reflectance spectra as well as MERIS reflectance data covering two optically shallow water environments. Bathymetries derived using this process showed strong agreement with those determined from soundings and coastal relief models. Although SWORD-derived raster albedo maps showed general concordance to benthic habitat surveys, we found limited benefit of fixing this parameter in spectral matching routines. IOP derivations from SWORD show expected spatiotemporal patterns in the Florida Keys region, consistent with local hydrodynamic processes, seasonal fluctuations, and known anomalous events. This approach is portable to multi spectral reflectance data from similar satellite instruments, allowing regular and ongoing assessment and monitoring of optical water quality for ecologically and economically important marine systems.

AB The snow specific area (SSA) is a quantity to describe the size of snow grains, which controls the albedo of snow surface. The remote sensing retrieval of snow SSA is important for large scale energy and snow physical properties studies. The previous SSA retrieval algorithms are based on snow reflectance forward models with shape assumptions of snow grains, which may cause bias in the quantitative retrieval of SSA. In this paper, a new SSA retrieval algorithm based on a recently developed snow reflectance model is presented. In the reflectance model, the microstructure of snow medium is simulated by computer and the light scattering process is modeled by Monte Carlo ray tracing and radiative transfer theory. Validation shows the model can accurately simulate snow surface reflectance even at large incident or observation zenith angles. Three datasets were used to validate the SSA retrieval algorithm. The validation results show that the SSA can be accurately estimated using MODIS data. The difference of SSA by using reflectance of different wavelengths are studied by MODIS band 5 and band 6 data. The SSA retrieval algorithm is then applied to seasonal snow cover to study the temporal and spatial pattern of snow surface optical grain size.

AB The Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) has produced a climate-quality, error characterised, dataset of ocean-colour products (a designated Essential Climate Variable or 'ECV'). The OC-CCI project uses an optical classification scheme based on fuzzy logic (Moore et al. 2001), to assign product uncertainties on a pixel-by-pixel basis. In this study we show that the pre-existing set of optical water classes derived from in-water remote-sensing reflectance data are insufficient to classify all R-rs spectra present in satellite data at the global scale, particularly in oligotrophic regions. We generate a new set of optical water classes from millions of satellite-derived ocean-colour spectra, providing an improvement in distribution of cumulative class membership values. The use of these classes for uncertainty assignment are demonstrated for chlorophyll-a, utilising a large in situ database of measurements. In addition to being used for uncertainty assignment, performance of multiple chlorophyll algorithms is assessed within each of the classes and a method for blending algorithms while avoiding sharp boundaries, in order to improve final product quality, using class membership is illustrated.

AB Snow is a major source of streamflow in Central Alborz Mountains in northern Iran. Hence, understanding the spatial distribution and temporal variation of snow is crucial for proper management of limited water resources in this region. Since the in-situ measurements in the area are not sufficient, we used the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products, for which their capabilities in providing a spatially distributed and accurate mapping of snow have been well demonstrated. In this analysis, we considered all the available MODIS acquisitions from both Aqua and Terra satellites for a total of 4873 daily tiles of MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 with 500-meters spatial resolution (version 5), collected during the winter seasons between years 2002 and 2015. The problem of cloud coverage, with serious constraints to the snow mapping in the area, is addressed by developing a sequential cloud removal algorithm, which applies different methods subsequently considering their performance in each month. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is able to reduce 94% of cloud coverage and preserve the accuracy of cloud-removed area by 93%. In addition, a clear decreasing trend in snow cover is observed in the region. For example, trend analysis (at 10% significance level) shows that 61% of areas between 2000 and 2300 m elevation levels experienced a reduction in duration of annual snow cover. Moreover, a general reduction in the duration of snow season is also evident over the entire study area. In spite of short duration (13 years) used in this research, outcomes indicate a severe snow cover reduction during recent years. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Tailings impoundment failures may lead to catastrophically fatal, environmental and financial consequences. Monitoring the stability of tailings facility is therefore indispensable for sustainable mining development. Particularly, tailings experience gradual consolidation settlement as the pore pressure dissipates and the terrain subsides. However, field investigations and geotechnical analysis at tailings impoundment are limited by sparse field instrumentation due to high cost. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can provide a full spatial view of settlement rate at millimeter-scale precision with bi-weekly or monthly updates. Here we integrate big remotely sensed data including multi-temporal and multi-spaceborne SAR images of ENVISAT, ALOS PALSAR-1, and Sentinel-1A, and SRTM DEM and LIDAR DEM, as well as water level data, to investigate the dynamics of consolidation settlement over the tailings impoundment area in the vicinity of Great Salt Lake, Utah. We show that the reclaimed south pond is experiencing enormous quasi-linear settlements with the largest rate of 200 + mm/yr around the low-permeable decant pond clay at the northeast corner during 2004-2011, and the rate decreases to 100 + mm/yr during 2015-2016. The nearly decadal InSAR measurements can be well-explained by geotechnical consolidation model, which reveals the long-term exponentially decaying settlement and predicts the settlement process in the near future. InSAR-derived displacement maps also highlight active motions of surrounding infrastructures, such as some highway segments. There is no clear evidence that the fluctuating deformation at those locations and seasonal varied water level are correlated. Our results demonstrate that high resolution surface displacement measurements from InSAR can significantly improve our understanding of tailings settlement process and facilitate the monitoring of dams/infrastructures stability.

AB Carbonate production on coral reefs is responsible for the provision of beach sands, for the maintenance of seawater chemical balances and for the growth of reef structure and associated habitat complexity. Key carbonate producers including hard coral, crustose coralline algae, foraminiferal sand and Halimeda were mapped from satellite imagery (spatial resolution 2.5 m, mean overall accuracy = 81%) and an upscaling model was applied to estimate carbonate production. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the influence of employing different calcification rates for live coral on the upscaling model. Contemporary coral reef carbonate production for the 21 reef platforms of the Capricorn-Bunker Group (southern Great Barrier Reef) is estimated to be between 489,000 and 659,000 t per year based on seawater chemistry, community composition, calcification rates and reef structural complexity (rugosity). The upscaling model was relatively insensitive to different parameterisations of live coral calcification employed, probably due to live coral being a relatively minor contributor by area (approximately 18% of total reef area throughout the study region). This suggests regional scale seafloor characteristics, such as percentage of area dominated by substrates prone to dissolution (e.g. coral rubble), have a strong bearing on calcium carbonate production and need to be given greater consideration The upscaling framework presented provides a new method for quantifying regional carbonate production that could be applied globally, and provides a valuable baseline against which future changes to carbonate production in this region can be assessed.

AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer new opportunities for wildlife monitoring, with several advantages over traditional field-based methods. They have readily been used to count birds, marine mammals and large herbivores in different environments, tasks which are routinely performed through manual counting in large collections of images. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic system able to detect large mammals in semi-arid Savanna. It relies on an animal -detection system based on machine learning, trained with crowd-sourced annotations provided by volunteers who manually interpreted sub-decimeter resolution color images. The system achieves a high recall rate and a human operator can then eliminate false detections with limited effort. Our system provides good perspectives for the development of data-driven management practices in wildlife conservation. It shows that the detection of large mammals in semi-arid Savanna can be approached by processing data provided by standard RGB cameras mounted on affordable fixed wings UAVs.

AB A thorough understanding of full waveform (FW) LiDAR data processing and associated uncertainty is critical to vegetation applications such as retrieving forest structure variables and estimating forest biomass. This paper applies the Bayesian non-linear modeling concept to process small-footprint FW LiDAR data (the Bayesian decomposition) collected at a study site of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) to investigate its potential for waveform decomposition and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, several possible models suitable for fitting waveforms were assessed within the Bayesian framework, and the Gaussian model was selected to perform the Bayesian decomposition. Subsequently, we conducted performance evaluation and uncertainty analysis at the parameter, derived point cloud and surface model levels. Results of the model reasonableness show that the Gaussian model is superior to alternative models with respect to uncertainty, physical meaning and processing efficiency. After converting waveforms to discrete points, the model comparisons demonstrate that the Bayesian decomposition can be utilized for FW LiDAR data processing, and its results are comparable to the direct decomposition (DD), Gold and RL (Richardson-Lucy) approaches in terms of the root mean squared error (RMSE < 0.93 m) of the point distances between the waveform-based point cloud and the reference point cloud. Additionally, more points can be extracted from FW LiDAR data with these methods than discrete-return LiDAR data, especially at the mid-story of vegetation based on the results of height bins, percentile heights and canopy LiDAR density at the individual tree level. Moreover, uncertainty estimates from the Bayesian method enhance the credibility of decomposition results in a probabilistic sense to capture the true error of estimates and trace the uncertainty propagation along the processing steps. For example, results of the surface model yield larger RMSE values (1.38 m vs. 0.65 m) with a wider credible interval than quantile point clouds with a more compact distribution. In contrast to commonly used deterministic approaches, the Bayesian decomposition method can produce an ensemble of reasonable parameter estimates with probability through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from the posterior distribution of model parameters. These parameter estimates and corresponding derived products can be queried to provide meaningful interpretation of results and associated uncertainty. Both the flat priors and empirical priors can achieve good performance of the decomposition while the empirical priors tend to significantly speed up the model convergence. The Bayesian approach also renders an important insight into the uncertainty of the model performance evaluation using field data by generating reasonable prediction intervals to reduce inherent errors of field measurements.

AB Standard atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms work well in open ocean areas where the water inherent optical properties (IOPs) are correlated with pigmented particles. However, the lOPs of turbid coastal waters may independently vary with pigmented particles, suspended inorganic particles, and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). In turbid coastal waters standard AC algorithms often exhibit large inaccuracies that may lead to negative water-leaving radiances (L-w) or remote sensing reflectance (R-rs). We introduce a new atmospheric correction algorithm for coastal waters based on a multilayer neural network (MLNN) method. We use a coupled atmosphere-ocean radiative transfer model to simulate the Rayleigh-corrected radiance (L-rc) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the R-rs just above the surface simultaneously, and train a MLNN to derive the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and R-rs directly from the TOA L-rc. The method is validated using both a synthetic dataset and Aerosol Robotic Network - Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) measurements. The SeaDAS NIR algorithm, the SeaDAS NIR/SWIR algorithm, and the MODIS version of the Case 2 regional water - CoastColour (C2RCC) algorithm are also included in the comparison with AERONET-OC measurements. The performance of the AC algorithms is evaluated with four statistical metrics: the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), the average percentage difference (APD), the mean percentage bias, and the root mean square difference (RMSD). The comparison with AERONET-OC measurements shows that the MLNN algorithm significantly improves retrieval of normalized L-w in blue bands (412 nm and 443 nm) and yields minor improvements in green and red bands compared with the other three algorithms. On a global scale, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD in normalized L-w by up to 13% in blue bands and by 2-7% in green and red bands when compared with the standard SeaDAS NIR algorithm. In highly absorbing coastal waters, such as the Baltic Sea, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD in normalized Lw by more than 60% in blue bands compared to the standard SeaDAS NIR algorithm, while in highly scattering coastal waters, such as the Black Sea, the MLNN algorithm reduces APD by more than 25%. These results indicate that the MLNN algorithm is suitable for application in turbid coastal waters. Application of the MLNN algorithm to MODIS Aqua images in several coastal areas also shows that it is robust and resilient to contamination due to sunglint or adjacency effects of land and cloud edges. The MLNN algorithm is very fast once the neural network has been properly trained and is therefore suitable for operational use. A significant advantage of the MLNN algorithm is that it does not need SWIR bands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Decomposition is an important biosphere process that recycles sequestered nutrients, plays a key role in carbon emissions, and accumulates compounds that exert negative feedbacks on primary production. In certain environments, litter comprises a considerable portion of the canopy, impeding the quantification of living biomass. Decomposition incurs physical changes and the genesis of decay pigments over time, causing the optical properties of litter to evolve in tandem. In order to simulate the spectral evolution of decaying leaves and relate the spectra to meaningful quantities of the biochemical compounds present, knowledge of the in-situ absorption properties of decay pigments is required. To determine the specific absorption coefficients of decay pigments in monocot leaf litter, we developed a spectral data set of multiple species at various decay stages concurrent with quantities of foliar compounds from fiber and humic acid analysis. Utilizing leaf humic acid content, the specific absorption coefficients for initial and advanced decay pigments were estimated using the PROSPECT model. For a 70-sample evaluation data set, simulated litter spectra closely matched the Reflectance, Transmittance, and Absorptance of measured leaves, with an average %RMSE (400-2500 nm range) of 4.95. Inversion of the expanded PROSPECT model had a moderate relationship between measured gravimetric humic acid content and the model inverted sum of initial and advanced decay pigments, as indicated by the R-2 = 0.62 and index of agreement = 0.72 goodness of fit statistics. Integrating the specific absorption coefficients of decay pigments into the PROSAIL model permitted the canopy reflectance of grassland scenes of intertwined photosynthetic leaves and litter to be simulated. Model inversion results aligned well with changes in canopy chlorophyll and biomass, cumulating in an R2 = 0.69 between measured and predicted leaf area index. Sensitivity analysis further revealed that canopy level reflectance in the near infrared region for mixed green vegetation and litter scenes are driven mainly by advanced decay pigments. Hence, the inclusion of decay pigments' specific absorption coefficients are of high importance for accurate simulation of mixed vegetation scenes. Further, the derived specific absorption coefficients can be utilized to quantify humic acid content in monocotyledon leaves as a proxy for decay stage and the carbon quality of litter.

AB Tree inventories, inter alia, need information on the tree species. Previous studies aimed at distinguishing tree species based on three dimensional tree structure metrics derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds or based on features from full-waveform (FW) laser scanning data provided by today's sensors. Classifications based on FW features mainly use echo amplitude, pulse energy (hereafter referred to as energy) and width, which are typically retrieved by waveform decomposition, often performed using the symmetric Gaussian distribution function.
   However, for forested areas, the symmetry of the echo shape is potentially modified by multiple scattering and the distribution of scattering elements (e.g. leaves). We assess the potential of processing full-waveform ALS data such that the third and fourth statistical moments, i.e. the echo skewness and the echo kurtosis, can be retrieved in addition to the amplitude, energy and FWHM. We propose a waveform decomposition approach using the skew normal distribution (SND) function, which enables the modelling of skewed echoes. We investigate the difference of tree-crown aggregated SND derived FW features between seven tree species (969 individual trees) in a temperate mixed forest with the aim of detecting the most descriptive echo features. The such derived FW features are tested for species classification.
   The results reveal that the largest differences across the tree species are in the mean energy of the first echoes (15 out of 21 species pairs show differences), followed by the mean amplitude of the first echoes and the mean skewness of all echoes originating from a single crown (14 out of 21 species pairs show differences against each other for both features).
   The differentiation of coniferous and deciduous trees benefits from the features derived from the SND decomposition compared to the use of echo amplitude only (0.39 vs. 0.61 in Cohen's k). As the classification accuracy of the three dominant tree species within the test site only shows a small increase (0.20 vs. 0.26 in Cohen's k) by adding FW features, we propose the use of such features in combination with features from multispectral data for this purpose.
   The SND decomposition is comparable to the Gaussian decomposition regarding the decomposition accuracy (RMSE = 4.45 vs. RMSE = 3.50) and computational cost. Hence, we propose the default use of the SND decomposition, as the SND is a more flexible function, allowing for the modelling of normally distributed echoes, as well as the fitting of skewed echoes, while no limitations regarding the direction of the skewness are introduced. We attribute the difficulties in the tree species classification to the relatively wide ranges of the crown aggregated features within one species, which for some features results in a considerable overlap of the feature ranges across the species.

AB Vegetative spring green-up date (GUD), an indicator of plants' sensitivity to climate change, exerts an important influence on biogeochemical cycles. Conventionally, large-scale monitoring of spring phenology is primarily detected by satellite-based vegetation indices (VIs), e.g. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). However, these indices have long been criticized, as the derived GUD can be biased by snowmelt. To minimize the snowmelt effect in monitoring spring phenology, we developed a new index, Normalized Difference Phenology Index (NDPI), which is a 3-band VI, designed to best contrast vegetation from the background (i.e. soil and snow in this study) as well as to minimize the difference among the backgrounds. We examined the rigorousness of NDPI in three ways. First, we conducted mathematical simulations to show that NDPI is mathematically robust and performs superior to NDVI for differentiating vegetation from the background, theoretically justifying NDPI for spring phenology monitoring. Second, we applied NDPI using MODIS land surface reflectance products to real vegetative ecosystems of three in-situ PhenoCam sites. Our results show that, despite large snow cover in the winter and snowmelt process in the spring, the temporal trajectories of NDPI closely track the vegetation green-up events. Finally, we applied NDPI to 11 eddy-covariance tower sites, spanning large gradients in latitude and vegetation types in deciduous ecosystems, using the same MODIS products. Our results suggest that the GUD derived by using NDPI is consistent with daily gross primary production (GPP) derived GUD, with R (Spearman's correlation) = 0.93, Bias = 2.90 days, and RMSE (the root mean square error) = 7.75 days, which outcompetes the snow removed NDVI approach, with R = 0.90, Bias = 7.34 days, and RMSE = 10.91 days. We concluded that our newly-developed NDPI is robust to snowmelt effect and is a reliable approach for monitoring spring green-up in deciduous ecosystems. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The intra-and inter-annual variability of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) products in Australia have been analysed using 10 years (2002 2011) of MODIS BRDF Collection 6 data. Root Mean Square (RMS) and Anisotropic Flat Index (AFX) parameters were used as BRDF shape indices to represent the overall BRDF shape. Australian vegetation structure and agro-climate regions were used to separate and analyse different BRDF shape patterns. The results confirmed earlier findings that the intra-annual variation of MODIS BRDF shape is stronger than the inter-annual. High variance in the shape parameters of the base BRDF model as well as poor quality data regions suggest that for spectral data correction, the data are better used as a spatial average of BRDF shape (e.g. over a vegetation structure/climate class patch). This can reduce the spatial variance of shape to similar levels observed in the local variance of spectral data. The within-and between-class variations as well as correlations between some BRDF shape indices and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) show that inter-annual relationships between BRDF parameters can be separated using strata based on vegetation structure (basically height, cover and dominant growth form). However, due to the different climate drivers involved, such as rainfall, light and temperature, the intra-annual variation is better analysed if the patches of vegetation structure classes are identified by climate zone for climatic homogeneity. It is found that if long term averages are used to represent stable focal points in the time series, significant relationships exist between BRDF indices and spectral indices such as NDVI. However, there is no satisfactory way to directly relate short term fluctuations of (e.g.) NDVI with short term BRDF changes. All of the indices are significantly related to rainfall, structural characteristics and biomass with lagged relationships providing a more suitable pathway to analysing short variations. It is concluded that for the situation where a high quality BRDF product is available, the best strategy would involve use of a set of vegetation structure class patches to increase the resolution of local differences in BRDF shape for inhomogeneous scenes as well as control the high variance in MODIS BRDF model shape parameters. The partial relationships found between some BRDF indices (in particular RMS) and average rainfall or stable (longer term) NDVI also provide a potential for empirically updating BRDF shape for climate variation in periods before MODIS data were available.

AB In this study, we used satellite imagery to conduct a statistical study of the ocean vortex train induced by the Kuroshio Current on the leeward side of Green Island, Taiwan. The spatial scale and characteristics of the ocean vortex train were analyzed using image datasets from five different high-resolution satellites, including optical imagery from the Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre and the Formosat-2 satellites and synthetic aperture radar imagery from the European Remote Sensing Satellite, Advanced Land Observing Satellite, and Sentinel -1. Satellite altimetry data and a moored acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) were used to calculate the velocity of the Kuroshio Current. The ADCP data suggest that the velocity increases on the western side of the vortex train when it is formed on the leeward side of Green Island. Data from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) showed that the sea surface temperature of the recirculation water was over 2 degrees C colder and the chlorophyll-a concentration was two times higher than that of the surrounding waters. These phenomena suggested upwelling, mixing processes, and an island-mass effect. Wind forcing had a pronounced effect on the characteristics of the vortex train. High-resolution satellite images indicate that the averaged aspect ratio of the vortex train is 2.09 and the dimensionless width is 2.02 under southerly winds, compared to 1.91 and 2.76, respectively, under northerly winds.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a spaceborne tool allowing near real-time imagery over large ground footprints of areas hundreds of kilometres wide. SAR also allows persistent observations of the process of oil discharges, benefiting from (1) day and night observations, (2) independence of cloud cover and (3) high revisiting frequencies. The interpretation of 82 SAR scenes over the Lower Congo Basin for the 1994-2012 period allowed the recognition of 1400 natural seepage slicks associated with 102 individual seep sites. We acquired an additional SAR data set with a short revisit time over a selected prolific area. The data set consisted of 22 SAR scenes acquired over a 10-day period, meaning a maximum revisiting period of 12 h between subsequent SAR acquisitions. The short-term approach shows that seepage slicks were detected with wind speeds between 1.5 and 6.5 m/s (2.91 to 12.63 knots). Both long-term and short-term monitoring evidences that seepage events are intermittent, with the occurrence rate of oil release ranging from 5 to 80%. Short-term monitoring shows that the seepage pace is independent between seep sites, suggesting contrasted controlling factors. It also shows that the residence time of seepage slicks is systematically shorter than 12 h, which is far below reported values. Understanding the seepage slick residence time is essential to provide an accurate estimation of the fluid flow and to compute the volumetric outflow. The integration of in-situ mooring points measuring the current velocity 10 m below the sea surface, in addition to local wind field and slick length, allowed us to more accurately estimate the residence time of oil slicks at the sea surface before vanishing. The results show that the sea surface residence time of oil slicks is limited to a few hours, with a median value of 3 h 15 min. These new residence time estimations allowed us to propose a quantification of the regional oil output in the Lower Congo Basin, estimated at 4380 m(3)/year. This area may therefore be considered as the world's third biggest oil-supplying province from natural leakages. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurately monitoring global vegetation dynamics with modern remote sensing is critical for understanding the functions and processes of the biosphere and its interactions with the planetary climate. The MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation index (VI) product has been a primary data source for this purpose. To date, the MODIS team had released several versions of VI products that have widely used in global change studies and practical applications. In this study, we re-examined the global vegetation activity by comparing the recent MODIS Collection 6 (C6) VIs with Collection 5 (C5) VIs including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Terra (2001-2015) and Aqua Satellites (2003-2015). We found substantial differences in global vegetation trends betweenTerra-C5 and -C6 VIs, especially EVI. From 2001 to 2015, global vegetation showed a remarkable greening trend in annual EVI from the Terra-C6 (0.28% year(-1) P < 0.001), in contrast to the decreasing EVI trend from the Terra-05 (-0.14% year(-1) P < 0.01). Spatially, large portions of the browning areas in tropical regions identified by Terra-05 VIs were not evident in Terra-C6 VIs. In contrast, the widespread greening areas in Terra-C6 VIs were consistent with Aqua C6 VIs and GIMMS3g NDVI. Our finding of a greening Earth supports the recent studies suggesting an enhanced land carbon sink. Our study suggests that most of the vegetation browning trends detected by MODIS Terra-C5 VIs were likely caused by sensor degradation, particularly for the period after 2007. Therefore, previous studies of temporal vegetation trends based solely on Terra-C5 VIs may need to be reevaluated. Our new analysis offers the most updated understanding of the global vegetation dynamics during the past 15 years and contributes to accurately understanding the role of vegetation played in the Earth's biogeochemical and climatic systems.

AB Numerous land surface phenology (LSP) datasets have been produced from various coarse resolution satellite data and different detection algorithms from regional to global scales. In contrast to field-observed phonological events that are defined by clearly evident organismal changes with biophysical meaning, current approaches to detecting transitions in LSP only determine the timing of variations in remotely sensed observations of surface greenness. Since activities to bridge LSP and field observations are challenging and limited, our understanding of the biophysical characteristics of LSP transitions is poor. Therefore, we set out to explore the scaling effects on LSP transitions at the nominal start of growing season (SOS) by comparing detections from coarse resolution data with those from finer resolution imagery. Specifically, using a hybrid piecewise-logistic-model-based LSP detection algorithm, we detected SOS in the agricultural core of the United States central Iowa at two scales: first, at a finer scale (30 m) using reflectance generated by fusing MODIS data with Landsat 8 OLI data (OLI SOS) and, second, at a coarser resolution of 500 m using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) observations. The VIIRS SOS data were compared with OLI SOS that had been aggregated using a percentile approach at various degrees of heterogeneity. The results revealed the complexities of SOS detections and the scaling effects that are latent at the coarser resolution. Specifically, OLI SOS variation defined using standard deviation (SD) was as large as 40 days within a highly spatially heterogeneous VIIRS pixel; whereas, SD could be <10 days for a more homogeneous set of pixels. Furthermore, the VIIRS SOS detections equaled the OLI SOS (with an absolute difference less than one day) in >60% of OLI pixels within a homogeneous VIIRS pixel, but in <20% of OLI pixels within a spatially heterogeneous VIIRS pixel. Moreover, the SOS detections in a coarser resolution pixel reflected the timing at which vegetation greenup onset occurred in 30% of area, despite variation in SOS heterogeneities. This result suggests that (1) the SOS detections at coarser resolution are controlled more by the earlier SOS pixels at the finer resolution rather than by the later SOS pixels, and (2) it should be possible to well simulate the coarser SOS value by selecting the timing at 30th percentile SOS at the finer resolution. Finally, it was demonstrated that in homogeneous areas the VIIRS SOS was comparable with OLI SOS with an overall difference of <5 days. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Siberian larch forests are a major and unique component of the circumpolar boreal biome. However, because of their large extent, remote location, and lack of consistent satellite data coverage prior to 2000, comparatively little is known about their disturbance and recovery patterns at the regional scale beyond the past 15 years. Spatial distribution of recovering forests in the boreal zone is highly important for quantifying the feedback of forest cover to the climate system through carbon cycling and surface albedo which are strongly related to stand age. This paper presents a new method to map stand age distribution of young recovering forests that are primarily dominated by larch in Siberia using Landsat data acquired during the data-rich post-2000 era. This approach is based on the assumption that the relationship between the spectral signature of a forest stand acquired by Landsat ETM + and TM sensors and stand age before and after the year 2000 is similar thus allowing for training the algorithm on the data from the post-2000 era and applying the algorithm to infer stand age for the pre-2000 era. The output map combines the modeled forest disturbances before 2000 (56% producer's and 81% user's accuracy for disturbances) and direct observations of forest loss after 2000 (80% producer's and 92% user's accuracy for disturbances) to deliver a 24-year stand age distribution map at 30-m resolution for the Siberian larch forests. This is the first dataset that focuses specifically on the mid-term stand age dynamics of these forests at the regional scale. Our results show that >10% of the forested area in the Siberian larch forests has experienced stand-replacing fires in the past 24 years. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Three multi-decadal satellite soil moisture (SM) products, obtained by merging two active and six passive, all-active -merged (CCI-ACT), all-passive-merged (CCI-PAS) and all-active-passive-merged (CCI-COMBINED), and Level-3 SM retrieved from Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission were evaluated over India. The evaluation strategy employed is twofold: (a) time series and correlation analysis of SM datasets with respect to the Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications-Land (MERRA-L) SM simulation and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded rainfall; (b) investigate the spatial distribution of random error of the satellite products using Triple Collocation (TC) approach. The Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the performance of CCI-ACT and CCI-COMBINED are comparable to each other and they agree well with the MERRA-L simulated SM time series. They also had a good rank correlation with rainfall. The random error from TC is represented in terms of fractional Root Mean Square Error (fRMSE(TC)). It also represents the sensitivity of satellite retrievals to changes in true state. The analysis of fRIVISE(TC) showed that descending swath of SMOS SM has a lower error than ascending for 71% of the pixels over India. CCI-ACT was found to have the most number of pixels with the lowest errors, having a mean fRMSE(TC) of 0.7188, compared to 0.7705 for CO-COMBINED, 0.7828 for CCI-PAS and 0.8308 for SMOS-D. However, the error in CCI-ACT was highest in arid desert regions of western India. The error in CCI-COMBINED, CCI-PAS and SMOS-D grew with an increase in vegetation density. The fRMSE(TC) maps were analysed against the maps of the probability of occurrence of Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), soil texture (percentage of clay, sand, and silt) and modified Koppen-Geiger climate classification. The climate classification map was used to classify fRMSE(TC) against the different homogeneous climate classes. The analysis of the maps revealed that the inconsistency in SMOS is because of the RFI events over India. However, a multiple linear regression based attribution study showed that SMOS-D is the least affected by vegetation (4%) and the spatial distribution of CO-ACT and CO-COMBINED error showed more affinity towards soil texture than vegetation density.

AB This study compared surface soil moisture from 11 separate remote sensing and modelled products across Australia in a common framework. The comparison was based on a correlation analysis between soil moisture products and in situ data collated from three separate ground-based networks: OzFlux, OzNet and CosmOz. The correlation analysis was performed using both original data sets and temporal anomalies, and was supported by examination of the time series plots. The interrelationships between the products were also explored using cluster analyses. The products considered in this study include: Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS; both Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) and L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (LMEB) algorithms), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2; both LPRM and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) algorithms) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) satellite-based products, and WaterDyn, Australian Water Resource Assessment Landscape (AWRA-L), Antecedent Precipitation Index (API), Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI), Mount's Soil Dryness Index (MSDI) and CABLE/BIOS2 model based products. The comparison of the satellite and model data sets showed variation in their ability to reflect in situ soil moisture conditions across Australia owing to individual product characteristics. The comparison showed the satellite products yielded similar ranges of correlation coefficients, with the possible exception of AMSR2 JAXA. SMOS (both algorithms) achieved slightly better agreement with in situ measurements than the alternative satellite products overall. Among the models, WaterDyn yielded the highest correlation most consistently across the different locations and climate zones considered. All products displayed, a weaker performance in estimating soil moisture anomalies than the original data sets (i.e. the absolute values), showing all products to be more effective in detecting interannual and seasonal soil moisture dynamics rather than individual events. Using cluster analysis we found satellite products generally grouped together, whereas models were more similar to other models. SMOS (based on LMEB algorithm and ascending overpass) and ASCAT (descending overpass) were found to be very similar to each other in terms of their temporal soil moisture dynamics, whereas AMSR2 (based on LPRM algorithm and descending overpass) and AMSR2 (based on JAXA algorithm and ascending overpass) were dissimilar. Of the model products, WaterDyn and CABLE were similar to each other, as were the API/AWRA-L and KBDI/MSDI pairs. The clustering suggests systematic commonalities in error structure and duplication of information may exist between products. This evaluation has highlighted relative strengths, weaknesses, and complementarities between products, so the drawbacks of each may be minimised through a more informed assessment of fitness for purpose by end users.

AB New approaches need to be considered to solve the current high demand for color producing agent (CPA) retrievals over inland and coastal waters (Case 2 waters). Traditional retrieval algorithms are known to fail over highly turbid Case 2 waters because they were developed specifically for the open ocean (Case 1 waters). Landsat 8 provides an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a new spectral coastal aerosol band in the blue. This additional information provides means to tackle this retrieval endeavor. A look-up-table (LUT) and spectrum matching methodology was implemented to simultaneously retrieve CPAs, taking advantage of Landsat 8's new features. A LUT of spectral remote-sensing reflectances (R-rs) with different concentrations of CPAs was produced using the in-water radiative transfer model HydroLight A model-based empirical line method (MoB-ELM) algorithm was developed to atmospherically correct the Landsat 8 imagery and allow direct comparison with the LUT of R-rs. This MoB-ELM atmospheric correction algorithm uses pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) from the image, ground-truth data and the HydroLight model. The retrieval algorithm was applied over three Landsat 8 scenes and shows a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of about 14% for chlorophyll-a, 11% for total suspended solids (TSS), and 7% for colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) when compared with ground truth data. The CPA concentration maps exhibit expected trends of low concentrations in clear water and higher concentrations in turbid water.
   These results demonstrate that the developed algorithm allows the simultaneous mapping of concentration of all CPAs in Case 2 waters and over areas where the traditional algorithms fail or are not available due to spatial resolution. Therefore, this study shows that the Landsat 8 satellite can be utilized over Case 2 waters as long as a careful atmospheric correction is applied. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We report on the maturation of optical satellite-image-based ice velocity mapping over the ice sheets and large glacierized areas, enabled by the high radiometric resolution and internal geometric accuracy of Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager (OLI). Detailed large-area single-season mosaics and time-series maps of ice flow were created using data spanning June 2013 to June 2015. The 12-bit radiometric quantization and 15-m pixel scale resolution of OLI band 8 enable displacement tracking of subtle snow-drift patterns on ice sheet surfaces at similar to 1 m precision. Ice sheet and snowfield snow-drift features persist for typically 16 to 64 days, and up to 432 days, depending primarily on snow accumulation rates. This results in spatially continuous mapping of ice flow, extending the mapping capability beyond crevassed areas. Our method uses image chip cross-correlation and sub-pixel peak-fitting in matching Landsat path/row pairs. High-pass filtering is applied to the imagery to enhance local surface texture. The current high image acquisition rates of Landsat 8 (725 scenes per day globally) reduces the impact of high cloudiness in polar and mountain terrain and allows rapid compilation of large areas, or dense temporal coverage of seasonal ice flow variations. The results rival the coverage and accuracy of interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) mapping. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The newly launched Landsat 8 satellite continues the long and extremely important record of Earth observation from the Landsat program. We analyzed differences between Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 surface reflectances and cirrus cloud characterization to address how substitutable Landsat 8 observations are within this long archive. Comparison of surface reflectance estimates acquired near simultaneously during Landsat 8's underflight orbital placement shows that Landsat 8 surface reflectance is consistently darker in the blue, green, and red bands and brighter in the near infrared than in Landsat 7. Vegetation indices that rely on the visible and near infrared bands should be used with caution as individual biases in index components can be amplified to create large biases in vegetation indices. We also analyzed time series datasets from the Landsat Climate Data Record (CDR) surface reflectance product across four scenes that contained only Landsat 7 data, Landsat 7 data and only Landsat 8 data post launch, and Landsat 7 data and data from both sensors post-launch to investigate how sensor differences propagate in time series analysis. If left uncorrected or unexplained, the difference in reflectance between Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 creates spurious time trends in visible wavelengths and in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The introduction of Landsat 8 into time series of Landsat 7 data also biases the mean reflectance or vegetation index value as measured by a time series model intercept while increasing the Root Mean Squared Error of such models. We characterized the spectral reflectance of cirrus clouds in the underflight data that were omitted from Landsat 7 cloud masks but were detected in Landsat 8's cloud mask due to the use of the newly added cirrus band. While these cirrus cloud observations missed in Landsat 7's cloud mask are only slightly brighter in the visible bands, a simulation of time series containing Landsat 8 data that does not use the cirrus band shows that omission of cirrus clouds can result in anomalously brighter time series intercepts and positive time trends. Our results indicate that while Landsat 8 has improved on the legacy of previous sensors through increased radiometric resolution, better cloud identification, and better geometric accuracy, difference in reflectance between sensors in the current Landsat CDR product must be corrected or explained within time series analysis to avoid deleterious consequences. Future efforts should identify the contributions of target specific effects versus differences in atmospheric correction methods to better inform approaches to synthesize the two sensors.

AB Ecological zones in a salt marsh are influenced by many factors, including hydroperiod, soil salinity, groundwater flow, and nutrient/oxygen availability. In this project, high-resolution aerial images taken by a Helikite helium balloon-kite at 100 m altitude were used to develop a detailed flooding model and derive a spatially comprehensive map of ecological zones at the headwaters of a small tidal marsh creek at a forest-marsh boundary in North Inlet estuary, South Carolina. We constructed photomosaics from Helikite imagery over a 150 x 100 m area to identify ecological zones using an automated, maximum likelihood classification. In the same area, we developed a digital terrain model with +/- 2 cm overall vertical accuracy, primarily from waterlines at known tide height tracked by Helikite imagery and GPS. These are low-cost, easily implemented methods for studying marsh processes where access is often challenging. Quantifying frequency of inundation, an approximation of hydroperiod, using our terrain model and comparing it to ecological zones revealed that there is not a linear relationship between elevation and inundation above mean high tide. Ecological zones exhibit complex spatial patterns that neither elevation nor hydroperiod alone can explain. In the northwestern basin, adjacent to a forest-marsh boundary, inflow of low salinity groundwater from a large freshwater lens beneath the forest prevents the development of Salicornia virginica zones and allows the high-marsh plant Juncus roemarianus to be present at middle-to-low marsh elevations. Conversely, in the southwestern portion of the basin adjacent to a relict beach ridge underlain by a smaller freshwater lens, saltwater infiltration during spring tides and evapotranspiration during neap tides allows Salicornia virginica zones to develop in hypersaline soils. Many of the current numerical models for predicting salt marsh ecological zonation consider hydroperiod as the main factor; however, the asymmetry of the basin in both ecological zones and freshened groundwater discharge imply groundwater and surface-water inundation should both be considered in the distribution of ecological zones in a coastal salt marsh.

AB MODIS is a reliable means of monitoring the snow cover extent over an entire river basin. However, it displays a few significant limitations for hydrologic forecasting, such as the inability to distinguish dry snow from wet snow, which could be addressed by the use of a technology such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study is based on the Nechako River basin, located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (Canada), where the snowpack can reach several meters in depth. Fifteen RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR Wide images were obtained in VV + VH polarization between the months of March and July 2012 and sixteen SENTINEL-1A IW images were obtained in W polarization between the months of February and June 2015. They were processed with an algorithm based on Nagler and Rott's methodology, but which employs a soft threshold to separate wet snow from dry snow instead of the -3 dB hard threshold used in their method. The wet snow probability maps from this technique correspond better to the uncertainties caused by the coniferous forest found throughout the river basin. They were combined with the MODIS snow-covered area (SCA) product to exploit its ability to accurately detect the snow cover extent. The wet snow probability was also cross-referenced with the MODIS SCA product to remove discrepancies caused by forested areas or waterlogged soil. When compared to the snow metamorphism model SURFEX-Crocus at the location of the snow pillows of the basin, the combined product improves the detection of snow from 81.7 to 915% compared to MODIS alone. It also reliably distinguishes wet snow, dry snow, and snow free conditions with an accuracy of 77.6%. Moreover, an agreement of 72.4% was established between this product and the MODIS Land Surface Temperature. As an example of the future application of this work for watershed management, the current dataset was used to successfully detect snowmelt and predict the peak inflow occurrence in the Nechako reservoir for the 2012 and 2015 winters.

AB Stretching over 4300 km north to south, Chile is a special country with complicated landscapes and rich biodiversity. Accurate and timely updated land cover map of Chile in detailed classification categories is highly demanded for many applications. A conclusive land cover map integrated from multi-seasonal mapping results and a seasonal dynamic map series were produced using Landsat 8 imagery mainly acquired in 2013 and 2014, supplemented by MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index data, high resolution imagery on Google Earth, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission DEM data. The overall accuracy is 80% for the integrated map at level 1 and 73% for level 2 based on independent validation data. Accuracies for seasonal map series were also assessed, which is around 70% for each season, greatly improved by integrated use of seasonal information. The importance of growing season imagery was proved in our analysis. The analysis of the spatial variation of accuracies among various ecoregions indicates that the accuracy for land cover mapping decreases gradually from central Chile to both north and south. More mapping efforts for those ecoregions are needed. In addition, the training dataset includes sample points spatially distributed in the whole country, temporally distributed throughout the year, and categorically encompassing all land cover types. This training dataset constitutes a universal sample set allowing us to map land cover from any Landsat 8 image acquired in Chile without additional ad hoc training sample collection.

AB In this study, a vertical correction method based on a two-layer aerosol model is proposed to estimate the surface-level visibility from satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD). The meteorological parameters from the re-analysis data of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) are applied to estimate the aerosol layer height (ALH) of the two-layer aerosol model via an automatic workflow. The estimated extinction coefficients near the surface by AOD/ALH over the single point of a lidar site in Shanghai agree well with those of the ground measurements from a visibility sensor, with a correlation coefficient of 0.86 and root mean squared error (RMS) of 0.19 km(-1) for the data set from April 18, 2008 to April 30, 2014. The season long spatial comparison demonstrates that most of the correlation coefficients (90%) are >0.6, and more than half of the samples (68%) have coefficients higher than 0.7 for the data set from January 1 to April 30, 2014. Dust transportation and higher relative humidity (RH) have been confirmed to be important factors in reducing the accuracy of estimated visibility, as these situations fail to meet the assumptions of the two-layer model. Additionally, the less-rigorous cloud mask algorithm of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/AOD might lead to overestimates of AOD, and further underestimating of the surface-level visibility. The spatial variation of temporal correlation coefficients shows that most comparison sites (>74%) of satellite estimations agree well with the surface-level visibility measurements, with correlation coefficients up to 0.6 during the study period. The northern area of Eastern China presented better agreement than the southern area. This may be related to the complex underlying surface characteristics and higher RH in the southern part. This work will significantly improve the quality of climate simulations and air quality forecasts in Eastern China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal remote sensing has been used to detect oil slicks, yet estimation of slick thickness has largely remained unfeasible, mainly because the optimal detection time during a day, the minimum detectable thickness (MDT), and the relationship between the thermal response and thickness all remain largely unknown. Here, a ground based experiment is used to address some of these uncertainties. The experiment measured the brightness temperatures (BTs) of oil slicks (with different known thicknesses) and oil-free water as a function of time of the day for both clear and turbid waters. The BT differences (BTDs) between oil slicks and oil-free water were further simulated using a diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model. The results demonstrate that: (1) for an oil slick that is in thermal equilibrium with the water, the optimal time for thermal detection is around local noon (positive BTDs) with midnight (negative BTs) being the next best time; the periods shortly before sunrise and after sunset are not suitable for the thermal detection of oil slicks; (2) a better linear relationship between slick thickness and BTD is found during daytime than night-time and the type of background water also plays a role in this; and (3) assuming a detection limit of 03 degrees C for a thermal sensor, the MDT at noon is approximately 40 mu m for both clear and turbid waters, while for other times of the day the MDT is higher (e.g., 75 and 150 pm for clear and turbid waters, respectively, at midnight). Detection limits for several existing satellite sensors and for other observation scenarios are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wide field view (WFV) sensor on board the Chinese GF-1, the first satellite of the China High-resolution Earth Observation System, is acquiring multi-spectral data with decametric spatial resolution, high temporal resolution and wide coverage, which are valuable data sources for environment monitoring. The objective of this study is to develop a general and reliable fractional vegetation cover (FVC) estimation algorithm for GF-1 WFV data under various land surface conditions. The algorithm is expected to estimate FVC from GF-1 WFV reflectance data with spatial resolution of 16 m and temporal resolution of four dates. The proposed algorithm is based on training back propagation neural networks (NNs) using PROSPECT + SAIL radiative transfer model simulations for GF-1 WFV canopy reflectance and corresponding FVC values. Green, red and near-infrared bands' reflectances of GF-1 WFV data are the input variables of the NNs, as well as the corresponding FVC is the output variable, and finally 842,400 simulated samples covering various land surface conditions are used for training the NNs. A case study in Weichang County of China, having abundant land cover types, was conducted to validate the performance of the proposed FVC estimation algorithm for GF-1 WFV data. The validation results showed that the proposed algorithm worked effectively and generated reasonable FVC estimates with R-2 = 0.790 and root mean square error of 0.073 based on the field survey data. The proposed algorithm can be operated without prior knowledge on the land cover and has the potential for routine production of high quality FVC products using GF-1 WFV surface reflectance data.

AB The net radiation flux available at the Earth's surface drives evapotranspiration, photosynthesis and other physical and biological processes. The only cost-effective way to capture its spatial and temporal variability at regional and global scales is remote sensing. However, the accuracy of net radiation derived from remote sensing data has been evaluated up to now over a limited number of in situ measurements and ecosystems. This study aims at evaluating estimates and uncertainties on net radiation derived from Landsat-7 images depending on reliability of the input surface variables albedo, emissivity and surface temperature. The later includes the reliability of remote sensing information (spectral reflectances and top of canopy brightness temperature) and shortwave and longwave incoming radiations.
   Primary information describing the surface is derived from remote sensing observations. Surface albedo is estimated from spectral reflectances using a narrow-to-broadband conversion method. Land surface temperature is retrieved from top of canopy brightness temperature by accounting for land surface emissivity and reflection of atmospheric radiation; and emissivity is estimated using a relationship with a vegetation index and a spectral database of soil and plant canopy properties in the study area. The net radiation uncertainty is assessed using comparison with ground measurements over the Crau-Camargue and lower Rhone valley regions in France. We found Root Mean Square Errors between retrievals and field measurements of 0.25-033 (14-19%) for albedo, similar to 1.7 K for surface temperature and similar to 20 W.m(-2) (5%) for net radiation. Results show a substantial underestimation of Landsat-7 albedo (up to 0.024), particularly for estimates retrieved using the middle infrared, which could be due to different sources: the calibration of field sensors, the correction of radiometric signals from Landsat-7 or the differences in spectral bands with the sensors for which the models where originally derived, or the atmospheric corrections. We report a global uncertainty in net radiation of 40-100 W.m(-2) equally distributed over the shortwave and longwave radiation, which varies spatially and temporally depending on the land use and the time of year. In situ measurements of incoming shortwave and longwave radiation contribute the most to uncertainty in net radiation (10-40 W.m(-2) and 20-30 W.m(-2), respectively), followed by uncertainties in albedo (<25 W.m(-2)) and surface temperature (similar to 8 W.m(-2)). For the latter, the main factors were the uncertainties in top of canopy reflectances (<10 W.m(-2)) and brightness temperature (5-7 W.m(-2)). The generalization of these results to other sensors and study regions could be considered, except for the emissivity if prior knowledge on its characterization is not available.

AB There are many studies showing the active optical reaction of a green leaf to the changing surroundings based on chloroplast movement and their rearrangement in plant cells. These studies concentrated mostly on the effect of one feature (leaf type, leaf side or light type) on the leaf optical spectra. We have measured the diffuse reflectance and transmittance spectra of tobacco green leaves in combination of 4 variants: in normal and water infiltrated leaves, in collimated or diffuse incident light, on both the adaxial and abaxial leaf sides, and for the face or side chloroplast arrangement. A Simple Explicitly Non-Linear Empirical model for Leaf Optical Properties (SENLELOP model) is used to theoretically describe, simulate and fit the deviations from the Lambert-Beer's law causing nonlinearity in the measured spectral changes. It is shown that the incident diffuse light is captured by the leaf more effectively than the collimated light. The light incident from the adaxial leaf side is more effectively absorbed than the same light incident from the abaxial leaf side. The air in intercellular spaces of natural leaf increases about twice the beam path and strongly deepens the non-linearity of the absorption process when compared with water infiltrated leaf. The chloroplast arrangement in the palisade cells is reflected in most of the studied differences. The leaf absorbance changed in our case of tobacco leaves up to 30% when the chloroplasts moved from the face to the side position. This change depends strongly on the wavelength and quite slightly on the character of incident light. Further analysis predicts that in practice the effect of chloroplast rearrangement on the reflectance spectra is in dependence on the wavelength of the light about 2-5% in our case of fully developed green leaves but can be higher in some cases. Thus it can affect values of some of the indices used in the remote sensing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is an essential biophysical variable and plays a critical role in the carbon cycle. Existing FAPAR products from satellite observations are spatially incomplete and temporally discontinuous, and also insufficiently accurate to meet the requirements of various applications. In this study, a new method is proposed to calculate high quality, accurate FAPAR from the Global [And Surface Satellite (GLASS) leaf area index (LAI) to ensure physical consistency between LAI and FAPAR retrievals. As a result, a global FAPAR product (denoted by GLASS) was generated from the GLASS LAI data from 2000. With no missing values, GLASS FAPAR product is spatially complete. Comparison of the GLASS FAPAR product with the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Geoland2/BioPar version 1 (GEOV1), and the Seaviewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) FAPAR products indicates that these FAPAR products exhibit similar spatial distribution pattern. However, there were relatively large discrepancies between these FAPAR products in equatorial forest regions and around 50-60 N, where the SeaWiFS FAPAR values were lower than the other products and GLASS FAPAR product showed the largest values. Temporal consistency analysis indicates that GLASS FAPAR product has continuous trajectories, while MODIS FAPAR product shows more unstable profiles, especially during the growing season. Direct comparison with ground-based estimates demonstrated that GLASS FAPAR values were more accurate (R-2 = 0.9292 and RMSE = 0.0716) than GEOV1 (R-2 = 0.8681 and RMSE = 0.1085), MODIS (R-2 = 0.8048 and RMSE = 0.1276) and SeaWiFS FAPAR values (R-2 = 0.7377 and RMSE = 0.1635).

AB The annual cycle of vegetation growth may be altered in response to climate changes affecting ecosystem dynamics. However, our understanding of vegetation seasonality is mostly limited to the mechanisms and attributes of phenological events, such as spring emergence and fall senescence. Here we have investigated the seasonal evolution of vegetation growth from winter dormancy to summer maturity of four forest types in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperate and boreal forests for 1982-2011. The present study assesses large-scale variations in the vegetation green-up rate (VG(rate)) and its connection to temperature variability using remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface air temperature. The average of the VG(ate) of the analysis period increases with latitude, which indicates that the canopy develops more rapidly from dormancy to maturity for vegetation in higher-latitude or colder climate zones. VG(rate) and precedent temperature also show a positive correlation (r) over temperate and boreal forests (67% of the forest area in the NH), indicating that increased temperatures lead to faster canopy development within the same climate zone or latitude band. Responsiveness of VG(rate) to temperature variability shows that despite the same magnitude of local temperature variability during extremely cold and warm years, the magnitude of VG(rate) acceleration in warm years (0.07 (15-day)(-1)) is larger than the VG(rate) deceleration in cold years (-0.03 (15-day)(-1)), suggesting that the response of VG(rate) to temperature variability is nonlinear. Among the four forest types examined in this study, the nonlinear responses are most clearly observed in deciduous broadleaf forests indicating that forest composition may regulate the large-scale response of canopy development to temperature variability. Overall, our results suggest that anomalous seasonal warming will significantly affect canopy developments over wide deciduous forest areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB New advances in satellite data acquisition and processing offer promise for monitoring agricultural lands globally. Using these data to estimate crop yields for individual fields would benefit both crop management and scientific research, especially for areas where reliable ground-based estimates are not currently made. Here we introduce a generalized approach for mapping crop yields with satellite data and test its predictions for yields across more than 17,000 maize fields and 11,000 soybean fields spanning multiple states and years in the Midwestern United States. The method, termed SCYM (a scalable satellite-based crop yield mapper), uses crop model simulations to train statistical models for different combinations of possible image acquisition dates, and these are then applied to Landsat and gridded weather data within the Google Earth Engine platform, where the Landsat is composited to find the "best" dates of observations on a pixel-by-pixel basis. SCYM estimates successfully captured a significant fraction of maize yield variation in all state-years, with a range of 14-58% and an average of 35% for this particular study region and crop. Similar results were observed for soybean, with an average of 32% of yield variation captured. The multi-year yield estimates were also used to examine the temporal persistence of yield advantages for the top yielding fields in different counties, which is one measure of how important factors such as farmer skill are in explaining yield gaps. The strength of the SCYM approach lies in its ability to leverage physiological knowledge embedded in crop models to interpret satellite observations in a scalable way, as it can be readily applied to new crops, regions, and types and timing of remote sensing observations without the need for ground calibration.

AB The Mekong Basin spanning large parts of continental Southeast Asia is endowed with rich natural resources that are increasingly under pressure as a result of rapid socio-economic development over the last decades. Particularly the forests in the region are threatened by large-scale infrastructure developments, the expansion of agriculture and trading of timber products. In view of these developments, this study provides an updated view of the current state of the forest resources in the region and the change they have undergone throughout the last decade. Annual maps of percent tree cover, herbaceous cover, and barren land for the years 2001-2011 were derived from 500 m MODIS data, and formed the basis for a tree cover specific identification of changes utilising long-term statistics on inter-annual prediction variability. Furthermore, the temporal patterns shown in the tree cover history of each pixel for the observation period, allowed a differentiation to be made between permanent forest cover conversions and temporary forest losses, as well as between areas of abrupt and more gradual forest dynamics. Average gross forest loss for the Lower Mekong Basin was estimated at a rate of 0.4% per year. When considering permanent forest losses only, the highest annual loss rates were evident for Vietnamese Basin area (1.1%), followed by the respective national areas of Cambodia (0.7%), Laos (0.4%), and Thailand (0.2%). Extensive areas of forests and forest regrowth within Laos and Vietnam have been affected by temporal losses that have been mostly attributed to shifting-cultivation practices and the conversion of natural forests to forest plantations. Furthermore, it could be shown that temporal patterns of change may possibly reveal information about the underlying causes of forest cover reduction. Forest clearance related to large-scale mechanised clear cutting, e.g. by the agroindustry, generally showed very abrupt decreases in canopy cover, while forest losses related to small-scale agricultural clearings or more selective logging where characterised by more gradual decreases.

AB We present the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX), its calibration and subsequent radiometric measurements as well as Earth science applications derived from this data. APEX is a dispersive pushbroom imaging spectrometer covering the solar reflected wavelength range between 372 and 2540 nm with nominal 312 (max. 532) spectral bands. APEX is calibrated using a combination of laboratory, in-flight and vicarious calibration approaches. These are complemented by using a forward and inverse radiative transfer modeling approach, suitable to further validate APEX data. We establish traceability of APEX radiances to a primary calibration standard, including uncertainty analysis. We also discuss the instrument simulation process ranging from initial specifications to performance validation. In a second part, we present Earth science applications using APEX. They include geometric and atmospheric compensated as well as reflectance anisotropy minimized Level 2 data. Further, we discuss retrieval of aerosol optical depth as well as vertical column density of NOx, a radiance data-based coupled canopy atmosphere model, and finally measuring sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs) and infer plant pigment content. The results report on all APEX specifications including validation. APEX radiances are traceable to a primary standard with <4% uncertainty and with an average SNR of >625 for all spectral bands. Radiance based vicarious calibration is traceable to a secondary standard with <= 65% uncertainty. Except for inferring plant pigment content, all applications are validated using in-situ measurement approaches and modeling. Even relatively broad APEX bands (FWHM of 6 nm at 760 nm) can assess Fs with modeling agreements as high as R-2 = 0.87 (relative RMSE = 27.76%). We conclude on the use of high resolution imaging spectrometers and suggest further development of imaging spectrometers supporting science grade spectroscopy measurements. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB In light of the growing volumes of remote sensing data generated by multiple space-borne platforms, integrated multi-sensor frameworks will continue to generate a significant interest in the frame of international forest monitoring initiatives. This work investigates the interoperability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical datasets for the purpose of large-scale and operational forest monitoring. Using a discriminant technique known as canonical variate analysis, we investigate the level of discrimination (between forest and non-forest training sites) achieved by different datasets, thereby providing an assessment of complementarity between Landsat data and SAR data acquired at C-band (RADARSAT-2) and L-band (ALOS PALSAR), as well as related texture measures. Spatio-temporal methods developed as part of Australia's Land Cover Change Program (an established forest mapping and carbon accounting scheme operating at continental scale) are subsequently used for the integration of Landsat and (segmented) PALSAR data. To highlight specific operational aspects of the multi-sensor framework, this approach is demonstrated over the Australian state of Tasmania (approximately 6.8 million ha), one of several national demonstrator sites defined by the Forest Carbon Tracking task of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO-FCT). In terms of complementarity, the combination of Landsat and L-band SAR data is found to provide most of the forest discrimination, while texture information and single-date C-band SAR data are found to provide only limited additional discrimination improvement in the frame of the considered monitoring system. The interoperability of optical and SAR data is assessed by comparison of forest maps resulting from the spatio-temporal processing under different scenarios, including: i) Landsat-only time series, ii) PALSAR-only time series, and iii) mixed Landsat-PALSAR tithe series. A comparison of the single-date optical and SAR-based forest classifications indicates a good agreement over Tasmania, with some bias towards forest in the PALSAR classifications. Significant differences are evident when considering the case of forest conversion (deforestation and afforestation) over large areas, thereby compromising the full interoperability of SAR and optical data within the framework of Australia's carbon accounting system.

AB Passive L-band (1-2 GHz) observables are sensitive to surface soil moisture and ocean salinity, which is the core of the "soil moisture and ocean salinity" (SMOS) mission of the European Space Agency (ESA). This work investigates microwave emission processes that are important to link L-band brightness temperatures with soil freeze/thaw states and the presence and the state of snow. To this end, a ground snow radiative transfer (GS RT) model has been developed on the basis of the "Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks" (MEMLS). Our model sensitivity study revealed that L-band emission of a freezing ground can be affected significantly by dry snow, which has been mostly disregarded in previous studies. Simulations suggest that even dry snow with mostly negligible absorption at the L-band can impact L-band emission of winter landscapes significantly. We found that impedance matching and refraction caused by a dry snowpack can increase or decrease L-band emission depending on the polarization and the observation angle. Based on the performed sensitivity study, these RT processes can be compensatory at vertical polarization and the observation angle of 50 degrees. This suggests the use of vertical polarized brightness temperatures measured at around 50 degrees in order to achieve segregated information on soil-frost. Furthermore, our simulations demonstrate a significant sensitivity of L-band emission at horizontal polarization with respect to the density of the lowest snow layer as the result of refraction and impedance matching by the snowpack.

AB We assess the feasibility of monitoring the landmass of Great Britain with satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, by analysing ERS-1/2 SAR and ENVISAT IS2 Advanced SAR (ASAR) archive data availability, geometric distortions and land cover control on the success of (non-) interferometric analyses. Our assessment both addresses the scientific and operational question of whether a nationwide SAR-based monitoring of ground motion would succeed in Great Britain, and helps to understand controlling factors and possible solutions to overcome the limitations of undertaking SAR-based imaging of the landmass. This is the first time such a nationwide assessment is performed in preparation for acquisition and processing of SAR data in the United Kingdom, and any other country in the world. Analysis of the ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT archives reveals potential for multi-interferogram SAR Interferometry (InSAR) for the entirety of Britain using ERS-1/2 in descending mode, with 100% standard image frames showing at least 20 archive scenes available. ERS-1/2 ascending and both ENVISAT modes show potential for non-interferometric and single-pair InSAR for the vast majority of Britain, and multi-interferogram only for 13% to 38% of the available standard frames. Based on NEXTMap (R) Britain Digital Terrain Model (DTM) we simulate SAR layover, foreshortening and shadow to the ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT Lines-Of-Sight (LOS), and quantify changes of SAR distortions with variations in mode, LOS incidence angles and ground track angles, local terrain orientation, and the effect of scale due to the input DIM resolution. The simulation is extended to the similar to 230,000 km(2) landmass, and shows limited control of local topography on the radar terrain visibility. According to the 50 m to 5 m DTM-based simulations, similar to 1.0-1.4% of Great Britain could potentially be affected by shadow and layover in each mode. Only similar to 0.02-0.04% overlapping between ascending and descending mode distortions is found, this indicating the negligible proportion of the landmass that cannot be monitored using either imaging mode. We calibrate the CORINE Land Cover 2006 (CLC2006) using Persistent Scatterer (PS) datasets available for London, Stoke-On-Trent, Newcastle and Bristol, to quantify land cover control on the PS distribution and characterise the CLC2006 classes in terms of the potential PS density they could provide. Despite predominance of rural land cover types, we predict potential for over 12.8 M monitoring targets for each acquisition mode using a set of image frames covering the entire landmass. We validate our assessment by processing with the Interferometric Point Target Analysis (IPTA) 55 ERS-1/2 SAR scenes depicting South Wales between 1992 and 1999. Although absolute differences between predicted and observed target density are revealed, relative densities and rankings among the various CLC2006 classes are found constant across the calibration and validation datasets. Rescaled predictions for Britain show potential for a total of 2.5 M monitoring targets across the landmass. We examine the use of the topographic and land cover feasibility maps for landslide studies in relation to the British Geological Survey's National landslide Database and DiGMapGB mass movement layer. Building upon recent literature, we finally discuss future perspectives relating to the replication of our feasibility assessment to account for higher resolution SAR imagery, new Earth explorers (e.g.
   , Sentinel-1) and improved processing techniques, showing potential to generate invaluable sources of information on land motions and geohazards in Great Britain. (C) 2014 British Geological Survey (c) NERC. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Wildland fire occurrence has been increasing in peatland ecosystems during recent decades. As such, there is a need for broadly applicable tools to detect and monitor controls on combustion such as surface peat moisture and water-table position. A field portable spectroradiometer was used to measure surface reflectance of two Sphagnum moss-dominated peatland experiments, one being an experimental study utilizing a factorial experiment of vegetation and water-table manipulations and the other being a field site located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan that is broadly representative of northern peatland ecosystems. Relationships were developed correlating spectral indices to surface moisture as well as water-table position using the surface reflectance data. Spectral convolutions, or integrations of the hyperspectral data with the relative spectral response curves of multispectral sensors, were also applied to represent spectral sensitivity of commonly used Earth observing sensors. Band ratios previously used to monitor surface moisture with these sensors were assessed. Strong relationships with surface moisture and water-table position are evident for both the narrow-band indices as well as broad-band indices. This study also revealed a dependence of spectral relationships on changes in vegetation cover, particularly ericoid shrubs, within the vegetation manipulation experiment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB During the last decade, the analysis of the ocean color satellite imagery has allowed determining the dominant phytoplankton groups in surface waters through the development of bio-optical models aimed at identifying the main phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) or size classes from space. One of these bio-optical model is PHYSAT, which is a global method applied for oceanic Case I water and used to identify in satellite pixels specific dominant phytoplankton groups, such as nanoeukaryotes, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, diatoms, Phaeocystis-like and coccolithophores. Here, we present a regionalized version of the PHYSAT method that has been specifically developed for the Mediterranean Sea due to the peculiarities of phytoplankton assemblages and succession than can be found in the basin and its particular optical properties. The updated version of the method, the so called PHYSAT-Med, has been validated successfully with large in situ datasets available for this oceanic region, mainly for nanoeukaryotes, Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and diatoms. PHYSAT-Med allows to include a much higher number of pixels for the Mediterranean than PHYSAT does, through the use of a new Look-Up-Table created specifically for this oceanic region. Results provided by PHYSAT-Med showed the dominance of Synechococcus versus prochlorophytes throughout the year at the basin level, although nanoeukaryotes were more abundant during winter months. In addition, PHYSAT-Med data identified a rise in the eukaryote biomass (mainly diatoms) during the spring period (March to April), especially in the Ligurian and Adriatic seas. PHYSAT-Med represents a useful tool for the spatio-temporal monitoring of different dominant phytoplankton functional types in Mediterranean surface waters at a high resolution.

AB Land surface albedo has been recognized by the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS) as an essential climate variable crucial for accurate modeling and monitoring of the Earth's radiative budget. While global climate studies can leverage albedo datasets from MODIS, VIIRS, and other coarse-resolution sensors, many applications in heterogeneous environments can benefit from higher-resolution albedo products derived from Landsat We previously developed a "MODIS-concurrent" approach for the 30-meter albedo estimation which relied on combining post-2000 Landsat data with MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) information. Here we present a "pre-MODIS era" approach to extend 30-m surface albedo generation in time back to the 1980s, through an a priori anisotropy Look-Up Table (LUT) built up from the high quality MCD43A BRDF estimates over representative homogenous regions. Each entry in the LUT reflects a unique combination of land cover, seasonality, terrain information, disturbance age and type, and Landsat optical spectral bands. An initial conceptual WT was created for the Pacific Northwest (PNW) of the United-States and provides BRDF shapes estimated from MODIS observations for undisturbed and disturbed surface types (including recovery trajectories of burned areas and non-fire disturbances). By accepting the assumption of a generally invariant BRDF shape for similar land surface structures as a priori information, spectral white-sky and black-sky albedos are derived through albedo-to-nadir reflectance ratios as a bridge between the Landsat and MODIS scale. A further narrow-to-broadband conversion based on radiative transfer simulations is adopted to produce broadband albedos at visible, near infrared, and shortwave regimes. We evaluate the accuracy of resultant Landsat albedo using available field measurements at forested AmeriFlux stations in the PNW region, and examine the consistency of the surface albedo generated by this approach respectively with that from the "concurrent" approach and the coincident MODIS operational surface albedo products. Using the tower measurements as reference, the derived Landsat 30-m snow-free shortwave broadband albedo yields an absolute accuracy of 0.02 with a root mean square error less than 0.016 and a bias of no more than 0.007. A further cross-comparison over individual scenes shows that the retrieved white sky shortwave albedo from the "pre-MODIS era" LUT approach is highly consistent (R-2 = 0.988, the scene-averaged low RMSE = 0.009 and bias = -0.005) with that generated by the earlier "concurrent" approach. The Landsat albedo also exhibits more detailed landscape texture and a wider dynamic range of albedo values than the coincident 500-m MODIS operational products (MCD43A3), especially in the heterogeneous regions. Collectively, the "pre-MODIS" LUT and "concurrent" approaches provide a practical way to retrieve long-term Landsat albedo from the historic Landsat archives as far back as the 19805, as well as the current Landsat-8 mission, and thus support investigations into the evolution of the albedo of terrestrial biomes at fine resolution.

AB Incident shortwave radiation (ISR) at the surface is an essential parameter in the land surface radiation budget and in many land surface process models. Incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is required by nearly all terrestrial ecosystem models. Although several global radiation products from numeric models and satellite observations have been released, their coarse spatial resolutions and low accuracy, especially at high altitude regions, limit their applications in land community. In this study, the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) ISR and PAR products are developed based on an improved look-up table method from 2008 to 2010 at a 5 km spatial resolution and a 3 hour temporal resolution, the first global radiation products at such high resolutions, from multiple polar-orbiting and geostationary satellite data, including the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG2) SEVIRI, the Multi-functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT)-1R, and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager. The look-up table algorithm primarily considers the influences of surface elevation, atmospheric water vapor because sensitivity experiments indicate that ISR and PAR are more sensitive to surface elevation, and less sensitive to atmospheric profiles and ozone amount. The water vapor absorption has strong impact on ISR but weak on PAR. Moreover, the surface bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is taken into account to retrieve spatially and temporally continuous surface reflectances from the geostationary satellite observations, which is an input parameter in the revised look-up table method. Ground-based measurement data from 34 sites are used to validate the improved algorithm and the GLASS products. The validation results of the instantaneous ISR and PAR products at all validation sites are notably good with coefficient of determination values of 0.83 and 0.84, respectively, and root mean square error values of 115.0 Wm(-2) and 49.0 Wm(-2), respectively. We also aggregate the GLASS ISR product for comparing with the corresponding ISCCP and CERES data at 7 SURFRAD sites and demonstrate that the GLASS ISR product is more accurate. The GLASS ISR and PAR products have been made publicly available. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes measurements of the phase angle dependence of sand density observable in hyperspectral reflectance. Bi-directional reflectance distribution measurements in the principal scattering plane were recorded for sand samples prepared near minimum and maximum relative densities. Radiative transfer theory for granular media of a single constituent would predict increased reflectance with increased density. However, sands are usually composite materials, and we observed that reflectance can actually decrease with increasing density when the dominant constituents of the sand are semi-translucent, and a darker fraction with typically smaller grains is also present. We postulate that under these circumstances, as density increases, multiple scattering modes are being suppressed as the darker absorbing fraction occupies more optimally the available pore space.

AB Satellite-based passive microwave remote sensing has been shown to be a valuable tool in mapping and monitoring global soil moisture. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Aqua platform (AMSR-E) has made significant contributions to this application. As the result of agency and individual initiatives, several approaches for the retrieval of soil moisture from AMSR-E have been proposed and implemented. Although the majority of these are based on the same Radiative Transfer Equation, studies have shown that the resulting soil moisture estimates can differ significantly. A primary goal of this investigation is to understand these differences and develop a suitable approach to potentially improve the algorithm currently used by NASA in producing its operational soil moisture product In order to achieve this goal, the theoretical basis of several alternative soil moisture retrieval algorithms are examined. Analysis has focused on five established approaches: the operational algorithm adopted by NASA, which is referred to as the Normalized Polarization Difference algorithm, the Single Channel Algorithm, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, the University of Montana soil moisture algorithm, and the HydroAlgo Artificial Neural Network algorithm. Previous comparisons of these algorithms in the literature have typically focused on the retrieved soil moisture products, and employed different metrics and data sets, and have resulted in differing conclusions. In this investigation we attempt to provide a more thorough understanding of the fundamental differences between the algorithms and how these differences affect their performance in terms of range of soil moisture provided. The comparative overview presented in the paper is based on the operating versions of the source codes of the individual algorithms. Analysis has indicated that the differences between algorithms lie in the specific parameterizations and assumptions of each algorithm. The comparative overview of the theoretical basis of the approaches is linked to differences found in the soil moisture retrievals, leading to suggestions for improvements and increased reliability in these algorithms.

AB The Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) sensors operationally measure a broad spectrum from microwave to ultraviolet wavelengths for generating 30 satellite products. The wide swath of the SNPP Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) observed a historic event: 3 typhoons that all hit China mainland within 5 days. The Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) provides critical supports to the SNPP instrumental validation and verification efforts. For example, the CRTM helped to verify image striping in the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) upper atmosphere channels. The CRTM has also been used to characterize the ATMS radiometric bias and has led to the development of a complementary cloud screening method. Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) 6 h analysis data as inputs to the CRTM, we can statistically quantify the spectral bias for each field of view (FOV) of the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS). The CRTM is also a very useful tool for cross-sensor verifications. Using the double difference method, it can remove the biases caused by slight differences in the spectral response and geometric angles between two instruments. The CRTM helps our understanding on radiometric and spectral calibrations. It is the CRTM simulations that enable us to determine the root cause of the VIIRS shortwave infrared band image striping during daytime. The CRTM is operationally used at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) for weather forecasting and monitoring satellite radiance biases and standard deviation.
   This study also demonstrated the CRTM capability for Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) radiance simulations. The first result showed a good agreement between the measurement and simulation. The CRTM for OMPS limb sensing, and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) shortwave radiation and long-wave radiation flux simulation capability need to be extended.

AB The phenology of a landscape is a key parameter in climate and biogeochemical cycle models and its correct representation is central to the accurate simulation of carbon, water and energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere. Whereas biogeographic phenological patterns and shifts have received much attention in temperate ecosystems, much less is known about the phenology of savannas, despite their sensitivity to climate change and their coverage of approximately one eighth of the global land surface. Savannas are complex assemblages of multiple tree, shrub, and grass vegetation strata, each with variable phenological responses to seasonal climate and environmental variables. The objectives of this study were to investigate biogeographical and inter-annual patterns in savanna phenology along a 1100 km ecological rainfall gradient, known as North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT), encompassing humid coastal Eucalyptus forests and woodlands to xeric inland Acacia woodlands and shrublands. Key phenology transition dates (start, peak, end, and length of seasonal greening periods) were extracted from 13 years (2000-2012) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA).
   Two distinct biogeographical patterns in phenology were observed, controlled by different climate systems. The northern (mesic) portion of the transect, from 12 S, to around 17.7 degrees S, was influenced by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (IT) seasonal monsoon climate system, resulting in strong latitudinal shifts in phenology patterns, primarily associated with the functional response of the C4 grass layer. Both the start and end of the greening ( enhanced vegetation activity) season occurred earlier in the northern tropical savannas and were progressively delayed towards the southern limit of the Eucalyptus-dominated savannas resulting in relatively stable length of greening periods. In contrast, the southern xeric portion of the study area was largely decoupled from monsoonal influences and exhibited highly variable phenology that was largely rainfall pulse driven. The seasonal greening periods were generally shorter but fluctuated widely from no detectable greening during extended drought periods to length of greening seasons that exceeded those in the more mesic northern savannas in some wet years. This was in part due to more extreme rainfall variability, as well as a C3/C4 grass-forb understory that provided the potential for extended greening periods. Phenology of Acacia dominated savannas displayed a much greater overall responsiveness to hydroclimatic variability. The variance in annual precipitation alone could explain 80% of the variances in the length of greening season across the major vegetation groups. We also found that increased variation in the timing of phenology was coupled with a decreasing tree-grass ratio. We further compared the satellite-based phenology results with tower-derived measures of Gross Ecosystem Production (GEP) fluxes at three sites over two contrasting savanna classes. We found good convergence between MODIS EVI and tower GEP, thereby confirming the potential to link these two independent data sources to better understand savanna ecosystem functioning.

AB Small glaciers and ice caps in mountainous areas are often sensitive indicators of local and global climate change. In this paper, typical continental glaciers, the Dongkemadi and its neighbouring glaciers in the central area of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, are monitored using multi-sensor C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The study includes analysis of the alternating processes of ablation and freezing, the glacier zones detected on SAR images, and the changing snow/firn line across different days, seasons, and years. Experiments show that in late summer the wet snow-/firn-ice boundary, which is termed the late summer wet snow/firn line (WSFL) is easily detected on SAR images and it is relatively stable over multiple days. Also, the detected late summer WSFL, and the recorded yearly equilibrium line which reflects glacier mass balance, are close in a positive mass balance year, but the detected late summer WSFL is lower than the equilibrium line in a negative mass balance year. By combining pit and SAR observations it was found that the firn can be divided into two parts on the glaciers; the thick firn that lies in the neve basin is distinct on SAR images in winter, but the fins surrounding the basin with thickness ranging from 0 to 20 cm is difficult to recognize. The thick firn line (the lower boundary of neve basin) is stable in observations eight years apart. Based on the C-band VV polarization SAR image experiments, field work, and existing records, the spatiotemporal backscatter signature specific to the typical continental glacier is identified. The spatiotemporal backscatter signature helps to understand mass balance proxies and surface melt patterns of the glaciers in SAR images. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate land surface evapotranspiration (ET) estimations over a heterogeneous ecosystem are important to understand the interaction between the land surface and atmosphere including practical applications in integrated water resources management. Though numerous studies have been adopted and developed based on remote sensing technology to make a more accurate prediction of regional ET distribution, there has been still degree of uncertainty due to high spatio-temporal variability of the ecohydrologic parameter. This study suggested the revised remote sensing-based Penman-Monteith (Revised RS-PM) model and Trapezoid Interpolation Model (TIM) using only remotely sensed data as input data to assess applicability over complex topography in East Asia. Ground observations at the two flux sites having different land surface conditions were used to evaluate intra-annual seasonality in 2008. Both models represented temporal compatibility yielding biases of -74.25-38.79 W m(-2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of 68.96-90.90 W m(-2) while the models consistently overestimated ET at the forests due to large amount of interception relatively restraining sufficient water supply to the plants. The revised RS-PM showed slight overestimation due to the overvalued Leaf Area Index (LAI) as an input parameter and classified parameterization in transpiration calculation. This algorithm was developed for global mapping of ET so that errors occurring from vegetation parameterization are inevitable. TIM reproduced higher ET than the measurements in a non-growing season since remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as an input parameter could be affected by cloud contamination. In contrast to the dormant season, the revised RS-PM estimated a larger amount of ET distribution than TIM in the growing season. A conservative estimation of TIM was mainly caused by the structural characteristics. Relationships between the land surface temperature and NDVI were contextually used to determine both maximum and minimum limits of the Priestley-Taylor parameters in the image data. Determination of the contextual relationship should be carefully conducted to achieve reliable estimations. Results of a sensitivity analysis shows that the net radiation (R-N) plays the most significant role in both models (+/- 17-20% for ET by +/- 20% change of R-N). Variation of LAI impacted ET mostly in the revised RS-PM in a dormant season due to a logarithmic relationship between canopy conductance and LAI. TIM, on the other hand, was barely affected by LAI because of the simple structure of the algorithm including the Priestley-Taylor equation. The results suggest that the models can be applied to a regional scale with heterogeneous topography over long term periods if the input data handling is carefully conducted. In particular, the models can be usefully applied where ground ancillary data are not readily available. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The ability to carry out land cover change analyses based on Land Use/Cover Classification (LUCC) maps from remote sensing data depends on the quality of the mapping method. Land cover areas obtained from unadjusted classifiers with unbalanced misclassification between different classes could result in erroneously identifying trends. The aim of our work is to describe a novel approach to obtaining LUCC maps with balanced misclassification errors and therefore unbiased predicted areas for each class. We achieve this by numerically minimizing the differences between area proportions obtained with unbiased statistical reference estimates, which is measured by a quantity we refer to as the Sum of Squared Class Unbalancedness (SSCU). We assess the proposed methods in the context of land cover classification with support vector machine classifiers at four points in time between 1975 and 2010 in the Maipo river basin (Central Chile) based on Landsat imagery. In this study, the optimization reduced the SSCU (theta) by 94% on average compared to unadjusted classification. The classifier adjustment also slightly increased the accuracy of the resulting LUCC maps. The amount of bias in classified land cover area and the degree of unbalancedness of misclassification errors differed among the land cover classes. Agricultural land showed the largest reduction in mean relative differences from 27% to 2% compared to the unbiased statistical area estimates. The greatest increase in User's Accuracy was obtained for urban land cover in 1999, where an increase from 56% to 85% was achieved. Qualitative improvements in the classification were visible in difficult classification areas such as dry floodplains. The proposed method is especially recommended for studies that aim to provide multitemporal comparisons. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Exploiting imaging spectrometer data with machine learning algorithms has been demonstrated to be an excellent choice for mapping ecologically meaningful land cover categories in spectrally complex urban environments. However, the potential of kernel-based regression techniques for quantitatively analyzing urban composition has not yet been fully explored. To a great extent, this can be explained by difficulties in deriving quantitative training information that reliably represents pairs of spectral signatures with associated land cover fractions needed for empirical modeling. In this paper we present an approach to circumvent this limitation by combining support vector regression (SVR) with synthetically mixed training data to map sub-pixel fractions of single urban land cover categories of interest. This approach was tested on Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap) data acquired over Berlin, Germany. Fraction estimates were validated with extensive manual mappings and compared to fractions derived from multiple, endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). Our regression results demonstrate that the sets of multiple mixtures yielded high accuracies for quantitative estimates for four spectrally complex urban land cover types, i.e., fractions of impervious rooftops and pavements, as well as grass- and tree-covered areas. Despite the extrapolation uncertainty of SVR, which resulted in fraction values below 0% and above 100%, physically meaningful model outputs were reported for a clear majority of pixels, and visual inspection underpinned the quality of produced fraction maps. Statistical accuracy assessment with detailed reference information for 92 urban blocks showed linear relations with R-2 values of 0.86, 0.58, 0.81 and 0.85 for the four categories, respectively. Mean absolute errors (MAE) ranged from 6.4 to 12.8% and block-wise sums of the four individually modeled category fractions were always around 100%. Results of MESMA followed similar trends, but with slightly lower accuracies. Our findings demonstrate that the combination of SVR and synthetically mixed training data enable the use of empirical regression for sub-pixel mapping. Thus, the strengths of kernel-based approaches for quantifying urban land cover from imaging spectrometer data can be well utilized. Remaining uncertainties and limitations Were related to the known phenomena of spectral similarity or ambiguity of urban materials, the spectral deficiencies in shaded areas, or the dependency on comprehensive and representative spectral libraries. Therefore, the suggested workflow constitutes a new flexible and extendable universal modeling approach to map land cover fractions. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The KwaZulu-Natal Bight is a highly variable bio-optical environment, where waters over the shelf can change from the oligotrophic case 1 conditions of the Agulhas Current to the case 2 inshore environment influenced by upwelling and riverine influx. This study represents the first radiometric and biogeochemical validation to be performed in the KwaZulu-Natal Bight. The aim is to assess the performance of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) normalised water-leaving reflectance (rho(w)), aerosol and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) products from the 2nd and 3rd reprocessing as well as the case 2 Regional (C2R) processor. Confidence flags indicated that the ocean colour products from the 2nd reprocessing were not reliable over the sampling site during the study period. Standard MERIS rho(w) products from the 3rd reprocessing gave good returns from 490 to 560 nm, with absolute percentage difference (APD) of 10-16%, whilst underestimations in the red ranged from 124 to 215% compared to in situ data. Adjacency correction with the improved contrast between ocean and land (ICOL) processor leads to a decrease in APD. The C2R gave mostly low correlation coefficient values with a positive bias; APD ranged from 9 to 13% in the blue, whilst the poorest performing waveband was 620 nm with an APD of 67% compared to in situ data. The 3rd reprocessing with ICOL correction Angstrom exponent showed the best correlation (R-2 = 0.951) with in situ data. The Chl-a product for case 1 waters from the 3rd reprocessing, Algal1, had the best agreement with in situ data, with a correlation coefficient of 0.796 and an APD of 54%. The Algal2 and C2R Chl-a products had low correlation coefficients and APD ranging from 72 to 103%. A dynamic per pixel classification technique for applying optimal MERIS Chl-a algorithms in the KwaZulu-Natal Bight or similar south-east African water types is described and evaluated in conjunction with the MERIS fluorescence line height product.

ID VEGETATION COVER; COEFFICIENTS; VALIDATION; ABUNDANCE
AB Linear spectral mixture models can be standardized by using endmembers that span the global mixing space. By combining the benefits of location-specific mixture models with standardized spectral indices, standardized mixture models offer consistency, simplicity, inclusivity and applicability. We construct a globally representative mixing space using a spectrally diverse collection of 100 Landsat ETM+ (Thematic Mapper 8: Enhanced Thematic Mapper+) subscenes. Global composites of 100,000,000 Landsat spectra, constructed from both exoatmospheric reflectance and atmospherically corrected surface reflectance, represent the spectral diversity of a wide range of terrestrial environments. Principal Component (PC) Analysis of the global composite shows that 99% of the spectral variance can be represented in a 3-dimensional mixing space of the low order PCs. Within this 3D space 98% of spectra are contained within a tetrahedral hull bounded by a continuous plane of substrates, and well-defined apexes corresponding to vegetation and dark endmembers. Suites of individual substrate, vegetation and dark endmember spectra are used to derive mean endmembers and to quantify the effects of endmember variability on fractions estimated from a standardized Substrate, Vegetation, and Dark (SVD) linear mixture model. Maximum endmember variability introduces less than 0.05 difference in S, V, and D fractions for most SVD models constructed from individual pixel endmember spectra giving less than 0.05 model misfit for more than 97% of pixels in the global composite. The mean SVD endmembers define a standard global mixture model for Landsat spectra. These SVD endmembers can be used to model mixed reflectance spectra from other sensors with similar spectral responses to Landsat ETM+. Comparisons of endmember fractions estimated from coincident acquisitions of Landsat TM and ETM + and WorldView-2 imagery show strong linear scaling for vegetation and dark fractions. Substrate fractions do not scale as linearly for the urban validation sites because the Landsat substrate endmember does not accurately represent the impervious surfaces imaged by World View-2. Comparisons of Landsat and WorldView-2 unmixed with the same Visible-Near Infrared (VNIR) endmembers derived from the global Landsat endmembers are also strongly correlated but with reduced bias. This linear scaling suggests that the Landsat global endmembers may provide a basis for standardized mixture models for WorldView-2 and other broadband sensors with spectral response similar to Landsat TM and ETM+. Comparisons of vegetation fractions with vegetation indices for the global composite show strong linear correspondence for Tasseled Cap Greenness and Enhanced Vegetation Index, with some degree of saturation at high fractions for the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index and a wide range of responses for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index.

AB Central Business Districts (CBDs) are an important urban structural type (UST), and an apparent structural feature of many large cities. CBD locations play a decisive role in the spatial arrangement of functions and exposures within cities. However, while past research underscores the importance of their spatial detection, delineation and cartographic representation, the definitions used are mostly functional and qualitative. Objective pre-defined methods/thresholds for the semi-automated spatial classification of CBDs, based on a quantitative approach, do not yet exist. This paper presents,a conceptual framework to define the CBD using physical and morphological parameters, and tests the approach using 3-D city models of three European test sites (Canary Wharf in London, La Defense in Paris, and Levent in Istanbul). From these case studies, we develop a transferable method to detect and delineate CBDs over larger areas from a combination of Cartosat-1 digital surface models and multispectral Landsat ETM+ imagery. Applying this wide-area method to the entire extents of the three European megacities of London, Paris and Istanbul, we detect CBDs with a user accuracy of 75.7% and spatially delineate them with overall accuracies of 82.9%. Finally, we apply spatial metrics to analyze and compare the location and distribution of CBDs across the three mega cities, finding many similarities between London and Paris, but showing that Istanbul features a more complex urban footprint, and a different spatial CBD pattern.

AB Volcanic activity is diverse in its manifestations and spans wide temporal and spatial scales. Monitoring volcanoes with any single sensor system can only provide a limited perspective on the nature of such activity because of trade-offs between spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. Spaceborne observations of volcanoes are thus optimized by utilizing data from different and complementary sensing instruments. This study examines the combined use of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) for analyzing thermal anomalies from four separate volcanoes: Erta 'Ale (Ethiopia), Kilauea (Hawai'i), Lascar (Chile) and Kliuchevskoi (Russia). MODIS provides a high temporal resolution (daily) but low spatial resolution (similar to 1 km) dataset and is used to measure volcanic thermal radiance. ASTER provides relatively high spatial resolution (similar to 90 m) image data and is used to define the size of thermal features, albeit at a poorer temporal frequency. Erta 'Ale and Kilauea have been erupting continuously over the 11-year study period and their thermal emission signatures reveal a persistent baseline on which occasional increases in thermal output, associated with more profuse effusions of lava, are superimposed. Kliuchevskoi also displays occasional peaks in thermal activity due to the eruption of lava however intervening periods are characterized by weak or absent thermal anomalies. Lascar, on the other hand, provides an example of volcanic activity that is difficult for MODIS-type sensors to detect. It is characterized by fumarolic activity that is too low in temperature and too spatially limited to be readily detectable with its coarser instantaneous field of view (i.e., pixel size). However, high resolution data from ASTER can be used to supplement and complement the MODIS dataset Beyond characterizing the size of thermal anomalies ASTER can also provide constraints on their shape, location and orientation and is capable of detecting relatively subtle thermal anomalies given its high spatial resolution thermal infrared wavebands. These qualities permitted the identification of a thermal precursor to lava flows at Kliuchevskoi. The precursor, which was associated with a rising lava lake, is characterized as an increase in the size and intensity of ASTER-detected thermal anomalies situated in the active crater. Wavelet analysis of the MODIS dataset was also carried out. This revealed the time scales over which radiant output waxed and waned during individual eruptive episodes as well as the repose time between episodes. Such information might be useful in forecasting the likely duration and onset of future eruptions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Static snow depth retrieval algorithms tend to underestimate the snow depth at the beginning of the snow season and overestimate the snow depth at the end of the snow season because the snow characteristics vary with the age of snow cover. A novel snow depth/water equivalent (SWE) data retrieval algorithm from passive microwave brightness temperature is proposed based on a priori snow characteristics, including the grain size, density and temperature of the layered snowpack. The layering scheme was established based on the brightness temperature difference (TBD) at two different frequencies, which indicates volume scattering, whereas the snow grain size and density of each layer were parameterized according to the age of the snow cover, and the snow temperature and temperature at the snow/soil interface were determined by the air temperature and snow depth. Furthermore, the microwave emission model of layered snowpacks (MEMLS) was used to simulate the brightness temperature at 10 GHz, 18 GHz and 36 GHz based on the a priori snow characteristics including snow grain size, density, depth and snow layering. Finally, three look-up tables (one layer, two layers and three layers) were generated for each day, which represent the relationship between the brightness temperatures at 10 GHz, 18 GHz and 36 GHz and snow depth. To avoid underestimation caused by the saturation of the microwave signal at 36 GHz, the TBD1 (the difference of brightness temperature at 18 and 36 GHz) was used to estimate the snow depth if TBD1 was less than 40 K, and TBD2 (the difference of the brightness temperature at 10 and 18 GHz) was used if TBD1 was greater than 40 K. The snow depth and SWE determined by this new algorithm were validated by snow measurements at thirteen meteorological stations in Xinjiang, China from 2003 to 2010 and compared with existing SWE products from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China (WESTDC), the European Space Agency (ESA) and measurements with a snow course. The results showed that the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the bias from this new algorithm were greatly reduced compared to NSIDC, moderately reduced compared to ESA and slightly reduced compared to WESTDC. The understanding of a priori local snow characteristics can improve the accuracy of snow depth and snow water equivalent estimation from passive microwave remote sensing data. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The uncertainty in tracking tropical forest extent and changes substantially affects our assessment of the consequences of forest change on the global carbon cycle, biodiversity and ecosystem services. Recently cloud-free imagery useful for tropical forest mapping from the Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) has become available. We used PALSAR 50-m orthorectified mosaic imagery in 2009 and a decision tree method to conduct land cover classification and generate a 2009 forest map, which was evaluated using 2106 field photos from the Global Geo-referenced Field Photo Library (http://www.eomf.ou.edu/photos). The resulting land cover classification had a high overall accuracy of 93.3% and a Kappa Coefficient of 0.9. The PALSAR-based forest map was then compared with three existing forest cover products at three scales (regional, national, and continental): the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Forest Resources Assessments (FRA) 2010, Global Land Cover Map with MERIS (GlobCover) 2009, and the MODIS Terra + Aqua land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1) 2009. The intercomparison results show that these four forest datasets differ. The PALSAR-based forest area estimate is within the range (6.1-9.0 x 10(5) km(2)) of the other three products and closest to the FAO FRA 2010 estimate. The spatial disagreements of the PALSAR-based forest, MCD12Q1 forest and GlobCover forest are evident: however, the PALSAR-based forest map provides more details (50-m spatial resolution) and high accuracy (the Producer's and the User's Accuracies were 88% and 95%, respectively) and PALSAR can be used to evaluate MCD12Q1 2009 and GlobCover 2009 forest maps. Given the higher spatial resolution, PALSAR-based forest products could further improve the modeling accuracy of carbon cycle in tropical forests. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates the effects of sub-grid lake variability on brightness temperature measurements and snow mass retrieval from passive microwave satellite data in the North Slope of Alaska. In situ snow measurements of water equivalent, depth and density collected from field surveys during 1996-2004 snow seasons were collocated with gridded SSM/I brightness temperatures. Sub-grid lake fraction was computed from a high-resolution land cover map derived from LANDSAT imagery. Another dataset was created consisting of multi-year time series of SSM/I and AMSR-E brightness temperatures and computed lake fraction. Consistent with other studies, it was found that lake fraction was negatively correlated with in situ snow depth and snow water equivalent and positively correlated with snow density, which indicates that lakes have a direct effect on snow cover distribution: They accumulate less but denser snow than surrounding land areas. Additionally, lake fraction was positively correlated with the brightness temperature measurements at 18 GHz and above, but negatively correlated with the AMSR-E brightness temperatures at low frequency channels (6 and 10 GHz), with the highest correlation values for the SSM/I (r = 0.57) and AMSR-E (r = 0.65) at 37 GHz dominating the response. Brightness temperature-based lake fraction algorithms were derived using stepwise regression. Performance assessment showed that the AMSR-E algorithm was superior to the SSM/I algorithm due to the use of the low frequency measurements not available from the SSM/I instrument. Combined lake fraction- and SSM/I brightness temperature-based snow depth and snow water equivalent algorithms were also derived using stepwise regression, with improved performance compared to conventional brightness temperature-based algorithms.

AB Lava flows represent one of the most significant volcanic hazards from basaltic monogenetic volcanoes, such as spatter cones, scoria cones, maars, and tuff rings. They are common features emanating from parasitic vents on the flanks of polygenetic volcanoes and in dominantly 'flat-lying' intraplate volcanic fields. The Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF) is a volcanic field that has been active for the last ca. 250 ka, hosting at least 50 monogenetic volcanoes. Morphometric parameters of lava flows, such as volume, length, thickness and area, were used to quantify the potential lava-flow inundation susceptibility to New Zealand's most densely populated area, the City of Auckland based on an airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Digital Surface Model (DSM). The morphometric parameters of fifteen studied flows included: average length of 2.5 km (range 0.7-6.5 km), overall average thickness of 14.8 m (range 3.4-43.8 m), average of maximum thicknesses of 48.2 m (range 18.3-180.5 m), average area occupied of 5.1 km(2) (range 0.4-25.1 km(2)) and average volume of 0.12 km(3) (range 0.005-1 km(3)). Based on these parameters and a LiDAR-derived DSM, the present topography was classified into: sea, topographic depressions; low-lying areas prone to inundation by an average lava flow; buffer zones prone to inundation only by extremely thick lava flows; and peaks or ridges, which are unlikely to be overtopped. In monogenetic fields, each new vent occurs in a new location, creating uncertainty around the spatial location of the volcanic hazard. Thus, this research provides a general vent location-independent approach to describe the lava flow susceptibility for a potentially active monogenetic volcanic field. What this analysis reveals is that the City of Auckland can be divided into two distinct areas with strongly different susceptibility to lava flow inundation. The southern part of the City is predominantly flat, without hindrance to lava flow, whereas the hilly northern and central part has many ridges that can limit or channelise lavas. These contrasting properties must be accounted for in scenario-based or probabilistic hazard and risk models developed for the AVF. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Multi-temporal ALOS/PALSAR images are used to automatically investigate landslide activity over an area of similar to 200 km by similar to 350 km in northern California and southern Oregon. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) deformation images, InSAR coherence maps, SAR backscattering intensity images, and a DEM gradient map are combined to detect active landslides by setting individual thresholds. More than 50 active landslides covering a total of about 40 km(2) area are detected. Then the short baseline subsets (SBAS) InSAR method is applied to retrieve time-series deformation patterns of individual detected landslides. Down-slope landslide motions observed from adjacent satellite tracks with slightly different radar look angles are used to verify InSAR results and measurement accuracy. Comparison of the landslide motion with the precipitation record suggests that the landslide deformation correlates with the rainfall rate, with a lag time of around 1-2 months between the precipitation peak and the maximum landslide displacement. The results will provide new insights into landslide mechanisms in the Pacific Northwest, and facilitate development of early warning systems for landslides under abnormal rainfall conditions. Additionally, this method will allow identification of active landslides in broad areas of the Pacific Northwest in an efficient and systematic manner, including remote and heavily vegetated areas difficult to inventory by traditional methods.

AB This paper presents new methods for an automated analysis of the double InterTropical Convergence Zone (dITCZ) phenomena on a daily time scale over the east Pacific. Long-term Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) visible and infrared data are used to spatially identify and segment the convection zones over the east Pacific basin on both sides of the equator and to track the temporal variability of the ITCZ, specifically to identify cases of dITCZs, northern or southern ITCZ, or non-presence events. For the segmentation approach, image processing techniques are developed to extract information about the spatial features of the ITCZ in both hemispheres for each satellite image. These features serve as input to a temporal classification algorithm that is based on a combination of hidden semi Markov model (HsMM) and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The performance of the proposed method is competitive with human experts and the methodology can thus be used to conduct an in-depth analysis of the dITCZ. Such an analysis could provide precise information for refining existing weather and climate models over the sparsely observed east Pacific where the dITCZ is greatly over-represented in most models.

   waters
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DE Lakes; CDOM; Landsat; Carbon cycle
ID CHLORINATION; QUALITY
AB Recent studies indicate that lakes are regulators of carbon cycling and climate. Therefore, it is important to know how the lake carbon content has changed over the last decades. In situ long time data series about the amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in lakes are rare. The only potential way to study retrospectively the changes in lake carbon over the last decades is by means of remote sensing data provided there are sensors that can provide data about coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in lakes over long periods. Landsat data archive contains images from 1984 to nowadays and covers the whole Earth. Although the sensors were not designed for remote sensing of aquatic environments it is still tempting to utilise the long data series. Landsat 4, Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 imagery available in free Landsat image archive was compared with time series of CDOM in situ data from 19 sampling stations available in the Swedish University of Natural Sciences lake monitoring database. There was no correlation between the image and in situ data when all the above mentioned data were used. Low radiometric resolution of the sensor, small size of many lakes (= large adjacency effects) and high concentration of CDOM (negligible water leaving radiation) could be the reasons. The results were more promising (R-2 = 0.62) when Lake Malaren stations were analysed separately. The lake is sufficiently large and with variable, but not extremely high. CDOM content. The Lake Malaren in situ data showed very different trends in CDOM concentrations in different basins of the lake over the last 45 years. Although the correlation between the image and in situ data was a bit low for accurate daily estimation of CDOM concentrations from Landsat data it could allow detecting general trends in lake CDOM content. Unfortunately, there is currently a gap in Landsat archive (for our study sites) between 1988 and 1998 which makes calculations of long time trends unreasonable for the time being.

AB There is an increasing need to monitor the dynamics of green LAI of field crops through the growing season. A simple approach is to use a regression model to estimate crop LAI from a vegetation index derived from optical remote sensing data. However, variations of interference factors in the signal path could induce variations in spectral reflectance, leading to uncertainty in LAI estimation. A semi-empirical equation was implemented to estimate green LAI of field crops from Landsat-5/7 data using a few vegetation indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), the two band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) and the modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2). Data were collected during several growing seasons, from 1999 to 2006, over corn, soybean, and spring wheat fields in an experimental farm in Ottawa (ON, Canada). LAI estimated for corn, soybean and wheat from Landsat data using the vegetation indices was compared to ground LAI. Except for NDVI, comparable results were obtained from the other three vegetation indices, with a coefficient of determination above 0.83 and a root mean square error (RMSE) not more than 0.60. The performance of NDVI was less satisfactory (RMSE>0.66). The uncertainties in LAI estimation induced by variations in soil reflectance, leaf optical properties. canopy structure, and atmospheric conditions were assessed through a global sensitivity analyses using the PROSPECT leaf model coupled to the SAIL canopy model along with the 6S atmospheric transmission model. The sensitivity analyses show that different indices are affected differently by the various interference factors. Comparatively, NDVI is the most influenced by leaf chlorophyll but the least affected by leaf inclination. OSAVI and the narrow band MTVI2 are more efficient in reducing soil effects, and EVI2 has a better performance in reducing aerosol perturbation. At high LAI, the uncertainty of NDVI is the smallest, but the uncertainty propagated to LAI estimation is the largest due to saturation. In this case, vegetation indices that are less prone to saturation should be considered, such as EVI2 and MTVI2. When MTVI2 is used on multispectral data, its ability to reduce soil and leaf chlorophyll perturbation is similar to EVI2 but weaker than when it is used on hyperspectral data. These results show that vegetation indices can be used in a simple regression model to generate baseline green LAI product for seasonal crop growth monitoring, however it is important to be aware of the sources of uncertainty and their relative amplitudes when using the product.

AB Landsat occupies a unique position in the constellation of civilian earth observation satellites, with a long and rich scientific and applications heritage. With nearly 40 years of continuous observation - since launch of the first satellite in 1972 - the Landsat program has benefited from insightful technical specification, robust engineering, and the necessary infrastructure for data archive and dissemination. Chiefly, the spatial and spectral resolutions have proven of broad utility and have remained largely stable over the life of the program. The foresighted acquisition and maintenance of a global image archive has proven to be of unmatched value, providing a window into the past and fueling the monitoring and modeling of global land cover and ecological change. In this paper we discuss the evolution of the Landsat program as a global monitoring mission, highlighting in particular the recent change to an open (free) data policy. The new data policy is revolutionizing the use of Landsat data, spurring the creation of robust standard products and new science and applications approaches. Open data access also promotes increased international collaboration to meet the Earth observing needs of the 21st century. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study develops a Two-source Trapezoid Model for Evapotranspiration (TTME) from satellite imagery by interpreting the remotely sensed fractional vegetation cover (f(c))-radiative surface temperature (T-rad) space and the concept of soil surface moisture availability isopleths superimposed on the space. The theoretical upper boundary condition of TTME is determined by solving for temperatures of the driest bare surface (T-s,T-max) and the driest fully vegetated surface (T-c,T-max) both implicit in radiation budget and energy balance equations. Air temperature (T-a) constitutes the lower boundary of TTME. T-rad of a pixel within the f(c)-T-rad space is decomposed into temperature components (T-c and T-s) by interpolating the slope of the theoretical boundaries and interpreting variation in T-rad with f(c) for each isopiestic line going across the pixel. Vegetation transpiration and soil surface evaporation are then separately parameterized. TTME was applied to the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX) site in central Iowa, U.S., on three days in 2002 during the period of rapid growth in corn and soybean when three scenes of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images and one scene of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) image were acquired. Results indicate that TTME is capable of reproducing latent heat flux (LE) with a mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) of similar to 10%, and a root mean square difference (RMSD) of 45.6 W m(-2) and 63.1 W m(-2) for Landsat TM/ETM+ and ASTER images, respectively. Comparison of TTME with other one-source and two-source models using the same data set suggests that TTME shows comparable accuracy as the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB), but requires relatively fewer inputs and obviates the computation of resistance networks in the modeling domain and the overestimation of vegetation transpiration incurred by using the Priestley-Taylor equation. Sensitivity analysis suggests that TTME is most sensitive to T-rad and T-a, but not sensitive to a range of meteorological observations and variables and parameters derived/specified.

AB Ice concentration retrieved from spaceborne passive microwave observations is a prime input to operational sea ice monitoring programs, numerical weather prediction and global climate models. However, it is usually underestimated by existing algorithms due to surface conditions, especially in case of young ice types. Evaluation of those algorithms identifies errors in concentration estimates but does not necessarily link them to the adverse surface conditions. The present study is an attempt to establish those links for young ice (<25 cm) thick It uses measurements of microwave emission from artificially grown sea ice in an outdoor tank and calculates ice concentration using five established algorithms: NT, Bootstrap (BSA), NT2, ASI and ECICE. Since the actual concentration is known (100%), then any deviation from this value is considered an error and can be linked to the observed surface conditions, which are usually caused by weather events. Those conditions were acquired on hourly or daily basis. Results identify key conditions that lead to underestimation of ice concentration. They include surface refreezing, slush, snow settling following fresh snowfall, and falling precipitation in different forms. The study shows also that NT and NT2 are most affected by surface processes while BSA performs better. ASI is much less affected because it uses the high frequency channel (e.g. SSM/I 85 GHz), which is sensitive only to processes within the top snow layer. ECICE, with its probabilistic and ensemble approach shows also good results under most surface conditions. Dry or wet snow does not lead to significant difference in ice concentration estimate. The study also aims at validation of ECICE. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) is a dual-view Earth observing instrument that builds on the heritage of the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) series. SLSTR is planned for launch in 2013 on Sentinel-3, with two concurrently operating satellites planned for daily global coverage. Here we review the aspects of the SLSTR instrument design specifically targeted at biomass burning events, including operation of the SWIR channels at night and the inclusion of low-gain middle infrared and thermal IR channels that will minimise saturation over even high intensity fires. We detail the active fire detection and fire radiative power dataset to be provided from these SLSTR observations, which will be part of the SLSTR land product suite aimed at supporting both Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) operational services and scientific applications. We describe in detail the pre-launch active fire product algorithm, which uses data from the SLSTR near-nadir scan. The algorithm detects pixels containing actively burning fires, and uses the MIR radiance method to estimate their fire radiative power (FRP). We test the algorithm using a series of EOS MODIS scenes covering a range of fire-affected forest and savannah environments, comparing performance to that of the existing MODIS MOD14 'Fire and Thermal Anomaly' products. Across 385 scenes covering Africa, South America and Australia, we find that the SLSTR algorithm applied to MODIS data detects in total 20% more fire pixels than does the MOD14 algorithm applied to the same data. Some scenes show very large differences, while others showed no differences, and some of the extra detections made by SLSTR maybe false alarms. For a better evaluation, we use the simultaneous high spatial resolution active fire detections made from ASTER to provide an independent accuracy assessment. Across 45 separate geographical regions covered simultaneously by ASTER and MODIS, we find that the SLSTR algorithm in fact detects 13% more correctly identified clusters of active fire pixels than the MOD14 algorithm, and that these contain 36% more active fire pixels. In particular, the SLSTR algorithm shows increased detection probabilities at small/low FRP fires, mainly due to the more liberal characteristics of its potential fire pixel detection stage. This performance enhancement comes, however, at the expense of a small (<2%) increase in commission error (i.e. false alarm rate) when compared to MOD14. The SLSTR algorithms ability to better detect low FRP fires maybe important, since these are usually the most common component of a region's fire regime. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding of mechanisms underlying carbon flux dynamics in the Eastern Arc Mountains and their catchment areas is lacking, due to data shortage (e.g. biome specific canopy structure) and spatial heterogeneity of tropical ecosystems. This study focuses on documenting leaf area index (LAI) for the main biomes in the Eastern Arc Mountains and their surroundings. In situ optical instruments, i.e. hemispherical photography and a SunScan device, were used to acquire ground LAI measurements. Spectral vegetation indices (Vls) extracted from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM +) and Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) reflectance data were used, along with mean annual precipitation (MAP), as explanatory variables of LAI variation. The results indicate that LAI significantly increases with increasing MAP for woody biomes. Implementing long-term MAP as a second predictor variable into the VI-LAI models significantly improved LAI predictions by up to 10% using the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI 2) and 2-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI 2). Varying forest disturbances and agricultural management practises may have contributed to observed discrepancies of LAI with MAP across biomes. The importance of altitudinal gradients is yet to be explained fully with more study required. However, LAI appears to be higher in low-altitude forests compared to forests at higher altitudes. Our results indicate that SPOT and Landsat-derived Vls, in combination with long-term MAP, may be a suitable tool to develop landscape maps of LAI in Eastern Africa. This study also presents the in situ LAI measurements for further validation of global products for areas that are currently under-represented in Earth Observation (EO) global validation networks.

AB A simple quadratic method is proposed for estimating the wavelengths of absorption features in the short wave infrared spectral region from hyperspectral instruments ranging from 2 to 18 rim sampling intervals. The method uses a direct substitution of the three spectral reflectance bands to achieve an estimate of the wavelength of the point of maximum absorption. The method is shown to be stable across different sampling regimes and therefore across different hyperspectral instruments. The results show it is possible to accurately estimate the wavelength of spectral absorption features to an RMSE of +/- 3.8 nm in the 2000-2500 nm spectral region over multiple sampling intervals and resolutions in sensors with signal-to-noise greater than 500:1.

AB We present the application of a photon path length probability density function (PPDF) formalism to atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) retrievals from reflected sunlight measured by the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) over the ocean. GOSAT short-wave infrared (SWIR) radiance spectra detected over the ocean surface were shown to be strongly affected by atmospheric light-scattering. In particular, retrievals of column-averaged CO2 dry-volume mixing ratios (XCO2) were characterised by steady negative bias and significant scatter when optical path modification due to high variability of clouds and aerosols was neglected. Considering that the ocean surface in SWIR is dark in all directions except that of sun-glint observation, PPDF radiative transfer modelling was simplified by neglecting the contribution of photons that interacted with both aerosols/cloud particles and the ocean surface. This permitted implementation of an atmospheric correction technique based on simultaneous retrievals of CO2 concentrations and two PPDF parameters: effective altitude of the aerosol layer and relative layer reflectivity. Using this correction, both bias and scatter of carbon dioxide retrievals were significantly reduced. The retrieval results of XCO2 statistically agreed (both spatially and temporally) with those predicted by the atmospheric transport model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Plot-scale brightness temperature (T-B) measurements at 6.9, 19, 37, and 89 GHz were acquired in forest, open, and lake environments near Churchill, Manitoba, Canada with mobile sled-based microwave radiometers during the 2009-2010 winter season. Detailed physical snow measurements within the radiometer footprints were made to relate the microwave signatures to the seasonal evolution of the snowpack, and provide inputs for model simulations with the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model. Large differences in depth, density, and grain size were observed between the three land cover types. Plot-scale simulations with the HUT model showed a wide range in simulation accuracy between sites and frequencies. In general, model performance degraded when the effective grain size exceeded 2 mm and/or there was an ice lens present in the pack. HUT model performance improved when simulations were run regionally at the satellite scale (using three proportional land cover tiles: open, forest, and lake) and compared to Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) measurements. Root mean square error (RMSE) values ranged from approximately 4 to 16 K depending on the frequency, polarization, and land cover composition of the grid cell. Snow water equivalent (SWE) retrievals produced using forward T-B simulations with the HUT model in combination with AMSR-E measurements produced RMSE values below 25 mm for the intensive study area. Retrieval errors exceeded 50 mm when the scheme was applied regionally. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study provides an introduction to the HyspIRI mission a National Research Council "Decadal Survey" mission that combines a 213 channel visible, near-infrared and shortwave infrared (VSWIR) imaging spectrometer with an 8 channel multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) instrument and evaluates some of its potential in urban science. Potential synergies between VSWIR and TIR data are explored using analogous airborne data acquired over the Santa Barbara metropolitan region in June, 2008. These data were analyzed at both their native spatial resolutions (7.5 m VSWIR and 15 m TIR), and aggregated 60 m spatial resolution similar to HyspIRI. A spectral library of dominant urban materials (e.g., grass, trees, soil, roof types, roads) was developed from field and airborne-measured spectra using Multiple-Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) and used to map fractions of impervious, soil, green vegetation (CV, e.g., trees, lawn) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV). Land Surface Temperature (LST) and emissivity were also retrieved from the airborne data. Co-located pixels from the VSWIR and TIR airborne data were used to generate reflectance/emissivity spectra for a subset of urban materials. MESMA was used to map GV, NPV, soil and impervious fractions at the different spatial resolutions and compare the fractional estimates across spatial scales. Important surface energy parameters, including albedo, vegetation cover fraction, broadband emissivity and surface temperature were also determined for and evaluated for 14 urban and natural land-cover classes in the region. Fractions were validated using 1 m digital photography.
   Fractions for GV and NPV were highly correlated with validation fractions at all spatial scales, producing a near 1:1 relationship but with a <10% overestimate of CV from MESMA. Similar, high correlations were observed for impervious surfaces, although impervious was significantly underestimated in most urban areas and soil overestimated. Comparison of fractions across scales showed high correlation between CV and NPV at 7.5 and 60 m resolution, suggesting that HyspIRI will provide accurate measures of these two measures in urban areas. An inverse relationship between vegetation cover and LST was observed. Albedo proved to be highly variable and poorly correlated with LST. Broadband emissivity was far less variable with high emissivity surfaces (similar to 0.95) including vegetation, water and asphalt, and low emissivity surfaces (<0.95) including selected roof types, beach sands and senesced grasslands. Residential and commercial areas showed a general pattern of increasing LST with increasing impervious fraction with the highest impervious fractions mapped in commercial areas, roads and roofs. Fine scale spatial structure in cover fractions and LST demonstrated important departures from a simple inverse relationship between CV and LST, even at 60 m. The results demonstrate the utility of HyspIRI data for urban studies and provide an insight of what will be possible on a global scale when HyspIRI data become available. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Information about the extent of impervious surface and its rate of development is a valuable indicator of urban growth and environmental quality and thus relevant for a wide range of research related to urban ecosystems. Using SPOT-5 data from 2005 to 2009, impervious surface was estimated at a subpixel level for the area of Can Tho province in the Mekong Delta, based on a Support Vector Regression model. Training data comprised a set of SPOT-5 reflectance values each associated with an individual value of subpixel imperviousness as their respective labels. The latter were obtained on the basis of a land cover map, which in turn was derived from a pansharpened QB subset by means of an object-oriented image classification approach. In addition, by varying different sets of training data in the model building process the spectral interrelationships between the urban land cover classes (water, bare soil, vegetation, and impervious surface) and their effect on the estimation of subpixel imperviousness could be examined. In order to exclude irrelevant areas (natural/undeveloped land) from the impervious surface estimation process, single-polarised TerraSAR-X data were used to delineate settlement areas by an object-oriented image classification approach. Furthermore, a change detection method was applied for the respective time period in order to test the suitability of the approach for the automated detection of structural developments within the urban topography. Settlement areas were correctly identified with overall accuracies between 81% and 94%, whilst the comparison of the modelled impervious estimates to the training values gave an absolute mean error below 15%. The results prove the suitability of the approach for an area-wide but selective mapping and monitoring of impervious surface cover within settlement areas only. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

   ANALYSIS
AB Time series of remote sensing imagery or derived vegetation indices and biophysical products have been shown particularly useful to characterize land ecosystem dynamics. Various methods have been developed based on temporal trajectory analysis to characterize, classify and detect changes in ecosystem dynamics. Although time series similarity measures play an important role in these methods, a quantitative comparison of the similarity measures is lacking. The objective of this study was to provide an overview and quantitative comparison of the similarity measures in function of varying time series and ecosystem characteristics, such as amplitude, timing and noise effects. For this purpose, the performance was evaluated for the commonly used similarity measures (D), ranging from Manhattan (D-Man), Euclidean (D-E) and Mahalanobis (D-Mah) distance measures, to correlation (D-CC), Principal Component Analysis (PCA; D-PCA) and Fourier based (D-FFT,D-xi, D-Fk) similarities. The quantitative comparison consists of a series of Monte-Carlo simulations based on subsets of global MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) data. Results of the simulations reveal four main groups of time series similarity measures with different sensitivities: (i) D-Man, D-E, D-PCA. D-Fk quantify the difference in time series values, (ii) D-Mah accounts for temporal correlation and non-stationarity of variance, (iii) D-CC measures the temporal correlation, and (iv) the Fourier based D-FFT and D-xi show their specific sensitivity based on the selected Fourier components. The difference measures show relatively the highest sensitivity to amplitude effects, whereas the correlation based measures are highly sensitive to variations in timing and noise. The Fourier based measures, finally, depend highly on the signal to noise ratio and the balance between amplitude and phase dominance. The heterogeneity in sensitivity of each D stresses the importance of (i) understanding the time series characteristics before applying any classification of change detection approach and (ii) defining the variability one wants to identify/account for. This requires an understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and time series characteristics related to the baseline, amplitude, timing, noise and variability of the ecosystem time series. This is also illustrated in the quantitative comparison, where the different sensitivities of D for the NDVI, EVI, and LAI data relate specifically to the temporal characteristics of each data set. Additionally, the effect of noise and intra- and interclass variability is demonstrated in a case study based on land cover classification. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Pixels, blocks of pixels, and polygons are all potentially viable spatial assessment units for conducting an accuracy assessment. We develop a population-based statistical framework to examine how the spatial unit chosen affects the outcome of an accuracy assessment. The population is conceptualized as a difference map created by overlaying a complete coverage reference classification and the target map being evaluated. The per-class areas of agreement and disagreement derived from this population are summarized by a population error matrix and accuracy parameters (e.g., overall, user's and producer's accuracies). The population and values of the accuracy parameters are strongly affected by the protocols implemented for the response design which include the choice of spatial unit, how within-unit homogeneity is addressed when assigning class labels, and the definition of agreement between the reference and map classification. Several complete coverage populations are used to illustrate how accuracy results are affected by the spatial unit chosen for the assessment and also to evaluate how spatial misregistration of the map and reference locations impacts accuracy results for different spatial units. The sampling design implemented for accuracy assessment does not change the population or values of the accuracy parameters, but the choice of spatial unit will influence decisions regarding use of strata and clusters in the design. A universally best spatial assessment unit does not exist, so it is critical to recognize how the population, values of the accuracy parameters, and sampling design are impacted by the choice of spatial unit.

AB We present an algorithm for retrieval of the effective Snow Grain Size and Pollution amount (SGSP) from satellite measurements. As well as our previous version (Zege et al., 2008, 1998), the new algorithm is based on the analytical solution for snow reflectance within the asymptotic radiative transfer theory. The SGSP algorithm does not use any assumptions on snow grain shape and allows for the snow pack bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). The algorithm includes a new atmospheric correction procedure that allows for snow BRDF. This SGSP algorithm has been thoroughly validated with computer simulations. Its sensitivity to the atmosphere model has been investigated. It is shown that the inaccuracy of the snow characteristic retrieval due to the uncertainty in the aerosol and molecular atmosphere model is negligible, as compared to that due to the measurement errors at least for aerosol loads typical for polar regions. The significant advantage of the SGSP over conventional algorithms, which use a priori assumptions about particle shape and (or) not allow for the BRDF of the individual snow pack, is that the developed retrieval still works at low sun elevations, which are typical for polar regions.

AB A method is presented to identify absorption characteristics of three optically-distinct phytoplankton classes from a suite of measurements of total phytoplankton absorption coefficient and chlorophyll-a concentration by successive application of the two-population absorption model of Sathyendranath et al. (2001) and Devred et al. (2006a). The total phytoplankton absorption coefficient at multiple wavelengths is expressed as the weighted sum of the absorption coefficients of each class at those wavelengths. The resultant system of equations is solved under some constraints to derive the fraction of each class present in any given sample of seawater, given the spectrum of total phytoplankton absorption coefficient. When applied to a large database, the results compare well with phytoplankton size-classes derived from pigment composition, so that we can assume that the three phytoplankton classes derived from absorption coefficients are representative of the pico-, nano- and microphytoplankton size classes. A modification is proposed to the pigment-based phytoplankton size classification of Uitz et al. (2006) to account for the effect of fucoxanthin associated with nanophytoplankton. Comparison between satellite and in situ data demonstrates the potential of satellite ocean-color data to yield the distribution of phytoplankton size classes from space. The algorithm is applied to phytoplankton absorption coefficients derived from remotely-sensed reflectance values collected by SeaWiFS over the Northwest Atlantic in 2007. Monthly composites for April. August and November, representative of Spring, Summer and Fall, give synoptic views of the phytoplankton community structure: a Spring bloom dominated by microphytoplankton is followed by a second, less intense, bloom in the Fall dominated by nanophytoplankton. Picophytoplankton are dominant in the study area in Summer. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Thermal remote sensing studies of actively burning wildfires are usually based on the detection of Planckian energy emissions in the MIR (3-5 mu m), LWIR (8-14 mu m) and/or SWIR (1.0-2.5 mu m) spectral regions. However, vegetation also contains a series of trace elements which present unique narrowband spectral emission lines in the visible and near infrared wavelength range when the biomass is heated to high temperatures during the process of flaming combustion. These spectral lines can be discriminated by detector systems that are less costly than the longer wavelength, actively cooled instruments more typically used in EO-based active fire studies. The main trace element resulting in the appearance of spectral emission lines appears to be potassium (K), with features at 766.5 nm and 769.9 nm. Here we study K-emission line spectral signature in laboratory scale fires using a field spectrometer, at a series of moderately-sized woodland and shrubland fires using airborne imagery from a new compact hyperspectral imager (HYPER-SIM.GA) operating at a relatively fine spectral sampling interval (1.2 nm), and at large open wildfires using the EO-1 satellite's Hyperion sensor. We derive a metric based on band differencing of the spectral signal both close to and outside of the K-line region in order to quantify the magnitude of the K-emission signature, and find that variations in this metric appear to track quite well with the commonly used measures of fire radiometric temperature and fire radiative power (FRP). We find that substantial flaming activity is required to generate a potassium emission signature, but that once present this can be detected using airborne remote sensing even through a substantial smoke layer that apparently obscures fire across the remainder of the VIS spectral range. Being specific to flaming combustion, detection of the K-emission line signature could prove useful in refining estimates of the gases released in open wildfires, since trace gas emission factors can vary substantially between flaming and smouldering stages. Finally, we demonstrate the first identification of the K-emission line signature from space using the EO-1 Hyperion instrument, but find it detectable only in certain instances. We conclude that a finer spectral and spatial resolution than that offered by Hyperion is required for improved detection performance. Nevertheless, our results point to the potential effectiveness of airborne and spaceborne K-emission signature detection as a complement to the more common thermal remote sensing approaches to wildfire detection and analysis. Sensors targeting this application should consider careful placement of the measurement wavelengths around the location of the K-line wavelengths, in part to minimise influences from the nearby oxygen A-band features.

AB MODIS global evapotranspiration (ET) products by Mu et al. [Mu, Q. Heinsch, F. A., Zhao, M., Running, S. W. (2007). Development of a global evapotranspiration algorithm based on MODIS and global meteorology data. Remote Sensing of Environment, 111, 519-536. doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2007.04.015] are the first regular 1-km(2) land surface ET dataset for the 109.03 Million km(2) global vegetated land areas at an 8-day interval. In this study, we have further improved the ET algorithm in Mu et al. (2007a, hereafter called old algorithm) by 1) simplifying the calculation of vegetation cover fraction; 2) calculating ET as the sum of daytime and nighttime components; 3) adding soil heat flux calculation; 4) improving estimates of stomatal conductance, aerodynamic resistance and boundary layer resistance; 5) separating dry canopy surface from the wet; and 6) dividing soil surface into saturated wet surface and moist surface. We compared the improved algorithm with the old one both globally and locally at 46 eddy flux towers. The global annual total ET over the vegetated land surface is 62.8 x 10(3) km(3), agrees very well with other reported estimates of 65.5 x 10(3) km(3) over the terrestrial land surface, which is much higher than 45.8 x 10(3) km(3) estimated with the old algorithm. For ET evaluation at eddy flux towers, the improved algorithm reduces mean absolute bias (MAE) of daily ET from 0.39 mm day(-1) to 033 mm day(-1) driven by tower meteorological data, and from 0.40 mm day(-1) to 0.31 mm day(-1) driven by GMAO data, a global meteorological reanalysis dataset. MAE values by the improved ET algorithm are 24.6% and 24.1% of the ET measured from towers, within the range (10-30%) of the reported uncertainties in ET measurements, implying an enhanced accuracy of the improved algorithm. Compared to the old algorithm, the improved algorithm increases the skill score with tower-driven ET estimates from 0.50 to 0.55, and from 0.46 to 0.53 with GMAO-driven ET. Based on these results, the improved ET algorithm has a better performance in generating global ET data products, providing critical information on global terrestrial water and energy cycles and environmental changes.

AB This study presents monthly estimates of groundwater anomalies in a large river basin dominated by extensive floodplains, the Negro River Basin, based on the synergistic analysis using multisatellite observations and hydrological models. For the period 2003-2004, changes in water stored in the aquifer is isolated from the total water storage measured by GRACE by removing contributions of both the surface reservoir, derived from satellite imagery and radar altimetry, and the root zone reservoir simulated by WGHM and LaD hydrological models. The groundwater anomalies show a realistic spatial pattern compared with the hydrogeological map of the basin, and similar temporal variations to local in situ groundwater observations and altimetry-derived level height measurements. Results highlight the potential of combining multiple satellite techniques with hydrological modeling to estimate the evolution of groundwater storage. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The application of spaceborne lidar data to mapping of ecosystem structure is currently limited by the relatively small fraction of the earth's surface sampled by these sensors; this limitation is likely to remain over the next generation of lidar missions. Currently planned lidar missions will collect transects of data with contiguous observations along each transect: transects will be spread over swaths of multiple kilometers, a sampling pattern that results in high sampling density along track and low sampling density across track. In this work we demonstrate the advantages of a hybrid spatial sampling approach that combines a single conventional transect with a systematic grid of observations. We compare this hybrid approach to traditional lidar sampling that distributes the same number of observations into five transects. We demonstrate that a hybrid sampling approach achieves benchmarks for the spatial distribution of observations in approximately 1/3 of the time required for transect sampling and results in estimates of ecosystem height that have half the uncertainty as those from transect sampling. This type of approach is made possible by a suite of technologies, known together as Electronically Steerable Flash Lidar. A spaceborne sensor with the flexibility of this technology would produce estimates of ecosystem structure that are more reliable and spatially complete than a similar number of observations collected in transects and should be considered for future lidar remote sensing missions.

AB Crop identification on specific parcels and the assessment of soil management practices are important for agro-ecological studies, greenhouse gas modeling, and agrarian policy development. Traditional pixel-based analysis of remotely sensed data results in inaccurate identification of some crops due to pixel heterogeneity, mixed pixels, spectral similarity, and crop pattern variability. These problems can be overcome using object-based image analysis (OBIA) techniques, which incorporate new spectral, textural and hierarchical features after segmentation of imagery. We combined OBIA and decision tree (DT) algorithms to develop a methodology, named Object-based Crop Identification and Mapping (OCIM), for a multi-seasonal assessment of a large number of crop types and field status.
   In our approach, we explored several vegetation indices (VIs) and textural features derived from visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands of ASTER satellite scenes collected during three distinct growing-season periods (mid-spring, early-summer and late-summer). OCIM was developed for 13 major crops cultivated in the agricultural area of Yolo County in California, USA. The model design was built in four different scenarios (combinations of three or two periods) by using two independent training and validation datasets and the best DTs resulted in an error rate of 9% for the three-period model and between 12 and 16% for the two-period models. Next, the selected DT was used for the thematic classification of the entire cropland area and mapping was then evaluated applying the confusion matrix method to the independent testing dataset that reported 79% overall accuracy. OCIM detected intra-class variations in most crops attributed to variability from local crop calendars, tree-orchard structures and land management operations. Spectral variables (based on VIs) contributed around 90% to the models, although textural variables were necessary to discriminate between most of the permanent crop-fields (orchards, vineyard, alfalfa and meadow). Features extracted from late-summer imagery contributed around 60% in classification model development, whereas mid-spring and early-summer imagery contributed around 30 and 10%, respectively. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to identify the main groups of crops based on the presence and vigor of green vegetation within the fields, contributing around 50% to the models. In addition, other VIs based on SWIR bands were also crucial to crop identification because of their potential to detect field properties like moisture, vegetation vigor, non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil. The OCIM method was built using interpretable rules based on physical properties of the crops studied and it was successful for object-based feature selection and crop identification.

AB This paper discusses an assessment of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series data products for detecting forest defoliation from European gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). This paper describes an effort to aid the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service in developing and assessing MODIS-based gypsy moth defoliation detection products and methods that could be applied in near real time without intensive field survey data collection as a precursor. In our study, MODIS data for 2000-2006 were processed for the mid-Appalachian highland region of the United States. Gypsy moth defoliation maps showing defoliated forests versus non-defoliated areas were produced from temporally filtered and composited MOD02 and MOD13 data using unsupervised classification and image thresholding of maximum value normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets computed for the defoliation period (June 10-July 27) of 2001 and of the entire time series. These products were validated by comparing stratified random sample locations to relevant Landsat and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) reference data sets. Composites of 250 m daily MOD02 outperformed 16-day MOD13 data in terms of classifying forest defoliation, showing a lower omission error rate (0.09 versus 0.56), a similar Kappa (0.67 versus 0.79), a comparable commission error rate (0.22 versus 0.14), and higher overall classification agreement (88 versus 79%). Results suggest that temporally processed MODIS time-series data can detect with good agreement to available reference data the extent and location of historical regional gypsy moth defoliation patches of 0.25 km(2) or more for 250-meter products. The temporal processing techniques used in this study enabled effective broad regional, "wall to wall" gypsy moth defoliation detection products for a 6.2 million ha region that were not produced previously with either MODIS or other satellite data. This study provides new, previously unavailable information on the relative agreement of temporally processed, gypsy moth defoliation detection products from MODIS NDVI time series data with respect to higher spatial resolution Landsat and ASTER data. These results also provided needed timely information on the potential of MODIS data for contributing near real time defoliation products to a USDA Forest Service Forest Threat Early Warning System.

AB To effectively manage forested ecosystems an accurate characterization of species distribution is required. In this study we assess the utility of hyperspectral Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications (AISA) imagery and small footprint discrete return Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data for mapping 11 tree species in and around the Gulf Islands National Park Reserve, in coastal South-western Canada. Using hyperspectral imagery yielded producer's and user's accuracies for most species ranging from >52-95.4 and >63-87.8%, respectively. For species dominated by definable growth stages, pixel-level fusion of hyperspectral imagery with LiDAR-derived height and volumetric canopy profile data increased both producer's ( +5.1-11.6%) and user's (+8.4-18.8%) accuracies. McNemar's tests confirmed that improvements in overall accuracies associated with the inclusion of LiDAR-derived structural information were statistically significant (p<0.05). This methodology establishes a specific framework for mapping key species with greater detail and accuracy then is possible using conventional approaches (i.e., aerial photograph interpretation), or either technology on its own. Furthermore, in the study area, acquisition and processing costs were lower than a conventional aerial photograph interpretation campaign, making hyperspectral/LiDAR fusion a viable replacement technology.

AB During the last few decades, many regions have experienced major land use transformations, often driven by human activities. Assessing and evaluating these changes requires consistent data over time at appropriate scales as provided by remote sensing imagery. Given the availability of small and large-scale observation systems that provide the required long-term records, it is important to understand the specific characteristics associated with both observation scales. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potentials and limits of remote sensing time series for change analysis of drylands. We focussed on the assessment and monitoring of land change processes using two scales of remote sensing data. Special interest was given to the influence of the spatial and temporal resolution of different sensors on the derivation of enhanced vegetation related variables, such as trends in time and the shift of phenological cycles. Time series of Landsat TM/ETM+ and NOAA AVHRR covering the overlapping time period from 1990 to 2000 were compared for a study area in the Mediterranean. The test site is located in Central Macedonia (Greece) and represents a typical heterogeneous Mediterranean landscape. It is undergoing extensification and intensification processes such as long-term, gradual processes driven by changing rangeland management and the extension of irrigated arable land. Time series analysis of NOAA AVHRRR and Landsat TM/ETM+ data showed that both sensors are able to detect this kind of land cover change in complementary ways. Thereby, the high temporal resolution of NOAA AVHRR data can partially compensate for the coarse spatial resolution because it allows enhanced time series methods like frequency analysis that provide complementary information. In contrast, the analysis of Landsat data was able to reveal changes at a fine spatial scale, which are associated with shifts in land management practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing models based on light use efficiency (LUE). provide promising tools for monitoring spatial and temporal variation of gross primary production (GPP) at regional scale. In most of current LUE-based models, maximal LUE (epsilon(max)) heavily relies on land cover types and is considered as a constant, rather than a variable for a certain vegetation type or even entire eco-region. However, species composition and plant functional types are often highly heterogeneous in a given land cover class; therefore, spatial heterogeneity of epsilon(max) must be fully considered in GPP modeling, so that a single cover type does not equate to a single epsilon(max) value. A spatial dataset of epsilon(max) accurately represents the spatial heterogeneity of maximal light use would be of significant beneficial to regional GPP models. Here, we developed a spatial dataset of epsilon(max) by integrating eddy covariance flux measurements from 14 field sites in a network of coordinated observation across northern China and satellite derived indices such as enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and visible albedo to simulate regional distribution of GPP. This dynamic modeling method recognizes the spatial heterogeneity of epsilon(max) and reduces the uncertainties in mixed pixels. Further, we simulated GPP with the spatial dataset of epsilon(max) generated above. Both epsilon(max) and growing season GPP show complex patterns over northern China that reflect influences of humidity, green vegetation fractions, and land use intensity. "Green spots" such as oasis meadow and alpine forests in dryland and "brown spots" such as build-up and heavily degraded vegetation in the east are clearly captured by the simulation. The correlation between simulated GPP and EC measured GPP indicate that the simulated GPP from this new approach is well matched with flux-measured GPP. Those results have demonstrated the importance of considering epsilon(max) as both a spatially and temporally variable values in GPP rnodeling. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, we used the remotely-sensed data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), meteorological and eddy flux data and an artificial neural networks (ANNs) technique to develop a daily evapotranspiration (ET) product for the period of 2004-2005 for the conterminous U.S We then estimated and analyzed the regional water-use efficiency (WUE) based on the developed ET and MODIS gross primary production (GPP) for the region. We first trained the ANNs to predict evapotranspiration fraction (EF) based on the data at 28 AmeriFlux sites between 2003 and 2005 Five remotely-sensed variables including land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and ground-measured air temperature and wind velocity were used. The daily Er was calculated by multiplying net radiation flux derived from remote sensing products with EF. We then evaluated the model performance by comparing modeled ET with the data at 24 AmeriFlux sites in 2006. We found that the ANNs predicted daily ET well (R-2 = 0.52-0.86). The ANNs were applied to predict the spatial and temporal distributions of daily ET for the conterminous U.S. in 2004 and 2005 The ecosystem WUE for the conterminous U.S. from 2004 to 2005 was calculated using MODIS GPP products (MOD17) and the estimated ET. We found that all ecosystems WUE-drought relationships showed a two-stage pattern Specifically, WUE Increased when the intensity of drought was moderate: WUE tended to decrease under severe drought. These findings are consistent with the observations that WUE does not monotonously increase in response to water stress Our study suggests a new water-use efficiency mechanism should be considered in ecosystem modeling. In addition, this study provides a high spatial and temporal resolution Er dataset, an important product for climate change and hydrological cycling studies for the MODIS era (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Net radiation is a key component in the surface radiation budget. Numerous studies have developed frameworks to estimate net radiation or its components (upwelling or downwelling longwave and/or shortwave radiation) from remote sensing data for clear sky conditions. Application of existing methodologies to estimate net radiation for cloudy sky conditions from remote sensing sensors remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present a framework to estimate instantaneous and daily average net radiation under all sky conditions from using the data from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), onboard from the Terra satellites. Bisht et al. (2005) methodology is used for the clear sky portion of the MODIS overpass; while for cloudy portion of the MODIS overpass an extension of Bisht et al. (2005) methodology is applied. The extension of Bisht et al. (2005) methodology utilizes the MODIS cloud data product (MOD06_L2) for cloud top temperature, cloud fraction, cloud emissivity, cloud optical thickness and land surface temperature for cloudy days. The methodology is applied over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) for a time period covering all seasons of 2006. During the MODIS-Terra overpasses in 2006 over the SGP, only 24% of day-overpasses and 9% of night-overpasses had 75% or more of the study region as cloud free. Thus, this proposed study is applicable to a large portion of the MODIS-Terra overpasses. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of instantaneous and daily average net radiation estimated under cloudy conditions using the MOD06_L2 product, comparing to ground-based measurements are 37 W m(-2) and 38 W m(-2), respectively. The strength of the proposed methodology is that it can rely exclusively on remote sensing data in the absence of ancillary ground observations, thus it has a potential to estimate surface energy budget globally.

AB Forest inventories based on single-tree interpretation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data often rely on an allometric estimation chain in which inaccuracies in the estimates of the diameter at breast height (DBH) propagate to other characteristics of interest such as the stem volume. Our purpose was to test nearest neighbor imputation by the k-Most Similar Neighbor (k-MSN) and the Random Forest (RF) methods for the simultaneous estimation of species, DBH, height and stem volume using ALS data. The predictors included computational alpha shape metrics and variables based on the height and intensity distributions in the ALS data. Separate data sets covering 1898 and 1249 dominant to intermediate trees in a typical Scandinavian stand structure were used for training and validation, respectively. RF proved to be a flexible method with an ability to handle 1846 predictors with no need for their reduction. Classification of Scots pine, Norway spruce and deciduous trees showed an accuracy of 78%, and the estimates of DBH, height and volume had root mean square errors of 13%, 3%, and 31%, respectively, when evaluated against the validation data. The two selection strategies implemented here reduced the number of candidate variables effectively without any substantial effect on the accuracy relative to the use of all predictors. Differences in k-MSN and RF imputations were marginal when the reduced sets of variables were used. Estimation accuracies could be maintained practically unchanged with only 12.5% of the initial reference data (237 trees), provided the distribution of the observations was similar in the reference and target data. Since we used information collected in the field for extracting the ALS point clouds for individual trees, our results represent an optimal case and should nevertheless be validated against automated tree delineation.

AB The study presents and discusses the application of in situ data from the ocean color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC) to assess primary remote sensing products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the AQUA platform and from the Sea-viewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) on the OrbView-2 spacecraft. Three AERONET-OC European coastal sites exhibiting different atmospheric and marine optical properties were considered for the study: the Acqua Alta Oceanographic Tower (AAOT) in the northern Adriatic Sea representing Case-1 and Case-2 moderately sediment dominated waters; and, the Gustaf Dalen Lighthouse Tower (GDLT) in the northern Baltic Proper and the Helsinki Lighthouse Tower (HLT) in the Gulf of Finland, both characterized by Case-2 waters dominated by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The analysis of MODIS derived normalized water-leaving radiance at 551 nm, L-WN(551), has shown relatively good results for all sites with uncertainties of the order of 10% and biases ranging from -1 to -4%. Larger uncertainty and bias have been observed at 443 nm for the AAOT (i.e., 18 and -7%, respectively). At the same center wavelength, results for GDLT and HLT have exhibited much larger uncertainties (i.e., 56 and 67%, respectively) and biases (i.e., 18 and 25%, respectively), which undermine the possibility of presently using remote sensing L-WN data at the blue center wavelengths for bio-optical investigations in the Baltic Sea. An evaluation of satellite derived aerosol optical thickness, tau(a), has shown uncertainties and biases of the order of tens of percent increasing with wavelength at all sites. Specifically, MODIS derived tau(a) at 869 rim, has shown an overestimate of 71% at the AAOT, 101% at GDLT and 91% at HLT, respectively. This result highlights the effects of a limited number of aerosol models for the atmospheric correction process, and might also indicate the need of applying a vicarious calibration factor to the remote sensing data at the 869 nm center wavelength to remove the effects of uncertainties in the atmospheric optical model and the space sensor radiometric calibration. Similar results have been obtained from the analysis of SeaWiFS data. Finally, in view of illustrating the possibility of increasing the accuracy of satellite regional radiometric products, AERONET-OC data have been applied to reduce systematic errors in MODIS and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) L-WN data likely due to the atmospheric correction process. Results relying on MODIS match-ups for the Baltic Sites (i.e., GDLT and HLT) and MERIS matchups for the AAOT, have indicated a substantial reduction of both uncertainty and bias in the blue and red center wavelengths.

AB The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) has operated since 19 December 1999 from NASA's Terra Earth-orbiting, sun-synchronous satellite. The Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm is used to calculate surface temperature and emissivity standard products, predicted to be within +1.5 K and +0.015 of correct values, respectively. Analyses of time sequences of ASTER images showing validation sites at Lake Tahoe, California, the Salton Sea, California, Railroad Valley Nevada, and the island of Hawai i demonstrate that TES generally performs within these limits. The validation experiments also demonstrate that, under unusual atmospheric conditions of anomalously high humidity or spatial variability, atmospheric compensation can be incomplete and errors in temperature and emissivity images can be larger than anticipated.

AB Improved wildland fire emission inventory methods are needed to support air quality forecasting and guide the development of air shed management strategies. Air quality forecasting requires dynamic fire emission estimates that are generated in a timely manner to support real-time operations. In the regulatory and planning realm, emission inventories are essential for quantitatively assessing the contribution of wildfire to air pollution. The development of wildland fire emission inventories depends on burned area as a critical input. This study presents a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) - direct broadcast (DB) burned area mapping algorithm designed to support air quality forecasting and emission inventory development. The algorithm combines active fire locations and single satellite scene burn scar detections to provide a rapid yet robust mapping of burned area. Using the U.S. Forest Service Fire Sciences Laboratory (FiSL) MODIS-DB receiving station in Missoula, Montana, the algorithm provided daily measurements of burned area for wildfire events in the western U.S. in 2006 and 2007. We evaluated the algorithm's fire detection rate and burned area mapping using fire perimeter data and burn scar information derived from high resolution satellite imagery. The FiSL MODIS-DB system detected 87% of all reference fires >4 km(2), and 93% of all reference fires >10 km(2). The burned area was highly correlated (R-2 = 0.93) with a high resolution imagery reference burn scar dataset, but exhibited a large over estimation of burned area (56%). The reference burn scar dataset was used to calibrate the algorithm response and quantify the uncertainty in the burned area measurement at the fire incident level. An objective, empirical error based approach was employed to quantify the uncertainty of our burned area measurement and provide a metric that is meaningful in context of remotely sensed burned area and emission inventories. The algorithm uncertainty is +/-36% for fires 50 km(2) in size, improving to +/-31% at a fire size of 100 km(2). Fires in this size range account for a substantial portion of burned area in the western U.S. (77% of burned area is due to fires >50 km(2), and 66% results from fires >100 km(2)). The dominance of these large wildfires in burned area. duration, and emissions makes these events a significant concern of air quality forecasters and regulators. With daily coverage at 1-km(2) spatial resolution, and a quantified measurement uncertainty, the burned area mapping algorithm presented in this paper is well suited for the development of wildfire emission inventories. Furthermore, the algorithm's DB implementation enables time sensitive burned area mapping to support operational air quality forecasting. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Monitoring vegetation dynamics is fundamental for improving Earth system models and for increasing our understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle and the interactions between biosphere and climate. Medium spatial resolution sensors, like MERIS, exhibit a significant potential to study these dynamics over large areas because of their spatial, spectral and temporal resolution. However, the spatial resolution provided by MERIS (300 m in full resolution mode) is not appropriate to monitor heterogeneous landscapes, where typical length scales of these dynamics rarely reach 300 m. We, therefore, motivate the use of data fusion techniques to downscale medium spatial resolution data (MERIS full resolution, FR) to a Landsat-like spatial resolution (25 m). An unmixing-based data fusion approach was applied to a time series of MERIS FR images acquired over The Netherlands. The selected data fusion approach is based on the linear mixing model and uses a high spatial resolution land use database to produce images having the spectral and temporal resolution as provided by MERIS, but a Landsat-like spatial resolution. A quantitative assessment of the quality of the fused images was done in order to test the validity of the proposed method and to evaluate the radiometric characteristics of the MERIS fused images. The resulting series of fused images was subsequently used to compute two vegetation indices specifically designed for MERIS: the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) and the MERIS global vegetation index (MGVI). These indices represent continuous fields of canopy chlorophyll (MTCI) and of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the canopy (MGVI). Results indicate that the selected data fusion approach can be successfully used to downscale MERIS data and, therefore, to monitor vegetation dynamics at Landsat-like spatial, and MERIS-like spectral and temporal resolution.

AB Research on change detected has largely focused on method development and evaluation in a temporally dependent manner where training and validation data are from the same temporal period. Monitoring over several change periods needs to account for increased variability resulting from possible combinations of atmosphere, sensor, and surface conditions. Training a change method for each monitoring period (i.e. a dynamic approach) is an option, but can be costly to develop the needed training datasets and many not be warranted if sufficient accuracy can be obtained without retraining (i.e. a statis approach). In this research the potential of change detection using a static approach suitable for near-real time annual monitoring was evaluated. The research assessed the influence of feature set size, radiometric normalization, incorporation of temporal information, and change object size and sub-pixel fraction on accuracy. The static approach was based on a decision tree developed using 250 m MODIS data from 2005 to 2006 and applied annually for the period 2001-2005. Change results between years were combined and compared to reference data representing change from 2001 to 2005 to evaluate monitoring performance. Results revealed high accuracy for the decision tree change model development from 2005 to 2006 (bootstrap cross-validation KAPPA = 0.91), with lower accuracy (KAPPA = 0.80) when applied for monitoring from 2001 to 2005. Radiometric normalization increased monitoring accuracy (KAPPA = 0.86). Further improvement was achieved with the incorporation of temporal contextual tests to combine the 2001-2005 inter-annual change maps (KAPPA = 0.90), but required a time lag of 1 year. An alternative temporal test that was not restricted by the 1 year time lag produced slightly lower accuracy (KAPPA = 0.88). Evaluation of the effect of object size on detection accuracy showed that accuracy for objects less than 7 pixels was strongly related to object size, with objects less than 3 pixels having low detection rates. The effect of sub-pixel change fraction was found to be dependent on object size with larger objects reducing detection error across the range of fractions evaluated.

AB The current outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) in British Columbia (BC), Canada, has led forest managers to consider thinning as a means of decreasing residual tree susceptibility to attack and subsequent mortality. Previous research indicates that susceptibility to mountain pine beetle is a function of a tree's physiological vigor and the intensity of attack. Trees able to produce >= 80 g (g) of wood per m(2) of projected leaf area annually are highly resistant, because they are able to shift resource allocation locally from wood to resin production to isolate blue-stain fungi introduced by attacking beetles. Typically, the leaf area of susceptible stands must be reduced by two-thirds to permit most residual trees to increase their vigor to a safe level. We evaluate whether Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery (30 x 30 m) provides a means to assess the maximum leaf area index (LAI) of unthinned stands and the extent that thinning reduces LAI. The extent that residual trees in thinned stands may have increased their resistance to attack from mountain pine beetle is predicted from a non-linear relationship between % maximum LAI and mean tree vigor.
   We investigated the merits of this approach in the vicinity of Parson, British Columbia using four stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl), two of which were heavily thinned (stands were spaced to 4 and 5 m, approximately 70% reduction in stand density). An analysis of archived Landsat TM imagery indicated that prior to thinning in 1993, all four stands had full canopy, which, for mature stands, would translate to mean tree vigor between 40 and 70 g of annual wood production per m(2) of foliage. By 1995, based on estimated changes in LAI derived from a second data of Landsat TM imagery. stand vigor in the unthinned stands had not changed; however, in the thinned stands, a nearly two third reduction in LAI resulted in a predicted increase in vigor to between 100 and 160 g wood m(-2) of leaf area. A subsequent assessment in 2001 indicated that stand vigor remained higher in the thinned stands relative to the control stands. Following an infestation of mountain pine beetle in the study area in 2002, mortality data indicated that the thinned stands experienced no mortality relative to the unthinned stands which experienced 5.5% mortality in the initial years of the attack. In the larger area surrounding the study site, a general relationship was found between predicted stand vigor and mountain pine beetle-induced mortality as estimated from aerial overview survey data (r(2) = 0.43. p <0.01).

AB High spatial resolution images allow us to assess the spatial structure and variability of natural vegetation characteristics. In order to optimize quantitative image analysis, we looked for the optimal spatial resolution to map natural vegetation in a Mediterranean environment. The optimal spatial resolution was then related to the spatial characteristics of the scene and the mapped parameters. Based on the relation between airborne hyperspectral imagery and field dataset consisting of 227 measured plots of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and aboveground biomass, we found an optimal pixel size of 55 and 95 m for the mapping of LAI and aboveground biomass, respectively. The optimal spatial resolution we found is determined by the spatial structure of the mapped parameters on the one hand, and by the effects of shading patterns and gaps in the canopy on the other. The spatial properties of scene elements influencing the optimal spatial resolution can be detected effectively using average local variance functions and variograms, provided that these are studied at a wide spatial range. The use of an optimally sized mapping unit instead of the original 5 m pixels resulted in an improvement of mapping accuracy of 7 to 17%. It is therefore recommended that the image support used is considered carefully in all quantitative mapping projects based on remotely sensed imagery. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Annual forest cover loss indicator maps for the humid tropics from 2000 to 2005 derived from time-series 500 m data from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were compared with annual deforestation data from the PRODES (Amazon Deforestation Monitoring Project) data set produced by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE). The annual PRODES data were used to calibrate the MODIS annual change indicator data in estimating forest loss for Brazil. Results indicate that MODIS data may be useful in Providing a first estimate of national forest cover change on an annual basis for Brazil. When directly compared with PRODES change at the MODIS grid scale for all years of the analysis, MODIS change indicator maps accounted for 75% of the PRODES change. This ratio was used to scale the MODIS change indicators to the PRUDES area estimates. A sliding threshold of percent PRODES forest and 2000 to 2005 deforestation classes per MODIS grid cell was used to match the scaled MODIS to the official PRODES change estimates, and then to differentiate MODIS change within various sub-areas of the PRODES analysis. Results indicate significant change outside of the PRODES-defined intact forest class. Total scaled MODIS change area within the PRODES historical deforestation and forest area of study is 120% of the official PRODES estimate. Results emphasize the importance of synoptic monitoring of all forest change dynamics, including the cover dynamics of intact humid forest, regrowth, plantations, and cerrado tree cover assemblages. Results also indicate that operational MODIS-only forest cover loss algorithms may be useful in providing near-real time areal estimates of annual change within the Amazon Basin.

AB We present an automated fire detection algorithm for the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor capable of mapping actively burning fires at 30-m spatial resolution. For daytime scenes, our approach uses near infrared and short-wave infrared reflectance imagery. For nighttime scenes a simple short wave infrared radiance threshold is applied. Based on a statistical analysis of 100 ASTER scenes, we established omission and commission error rates for nine different regions. In most regions the probability of detection was between 0.8 and 0.9. Probabilities of false alarm varied between 9 x 10(-8) (India) and 2x10(-5) (USA/Canada). In most cases, the majority of false fire pixels were linked to clusters of true fire pixels, suggesting that most false fire pixels occur along ambiguous fire boundaries. We next consider fire characterization, and formulate an empirical method for estimating fire radiative power (FRP), a measure of fire intensity, using three ASTER thermal infrared channels. We performed a preliminary evaluation of our retrieval approach using four prescribed fires which were active at the time of the Terra overpass for which limited ground-truth data were collected. Retrieved FRP was accurate to within 20%, with the exception of one fire partially obscured by heavy soot. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An explosive eruption occurred at Bezymianny Volcano (Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia) on 24 December 2006 at 09:17 (UTC). Seismicity increased three weeks prior to the large eruption, which produced a 12-15 kin above sea level (ASL) ash column. We present field observations from 27 December 2006 and 2 March 2007, combined with satellite data collected from 8 October 2006 to 11 April 2007 by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), as part of the instrument's rapid-response program to volcanic eruptions. Pixel-integrated brightness temperatures were calculated from both ASTER 90 m/pixel thermal infrared (TIR) data as well as 30 m/pixel short-wave infrared (SWIR) data. Four days prior to the eruption, the maximum TIR temperature was 45 degrees C above the average background temperature (-33 degrees C) at the dome, which we interpret was a precursory signal, and had dropped to 8 degrees C above background by 18 March 2007. On 20 December 2006, there was also a clear thermal signal in the SWIR data of 128 degrees C using ASTER Band 7 (2.26 mu m). The maximum SWIR temperature was 181 degrees C on the lava dome on 4 January 2007, decreasing below the detection limit of the SWIR data by 11 April 2007. On 4 January 2007 a hot linear feature was observed at the dome in the SWIR data, which produced a maximum temperature of 700 degrees C for the hot fraction of the pixel using the dual band technique. This suggests that magmatic temperatures were present at the dome at this time, consistent with the emplacement of a new lava lobe following the eruption. The eruption also produced a large, 6.5 km long by up to 425 m wide pyroclastic flow (PF) deposit that was channelled into a valley to the south-southeast. The PF deposit cooled over the following three months but remained elevated above the average background temperature. A second field investigation in March 2007 revealed a still-warm PF deposit that contained fumaroles. It was also observed that the upper dome morphology had changed in the past year, with a new lava lobe having in-filled the crater that formed following the 9 May 2006 eruption. These data provide further information on effusive and explosive activity at Bezymianny using quantitative remote sensing data and reinforced by field observations to assist in pre-eruption detection as well as post-eruption monitoring.

AB Radiative transfer models have seldom been applied for studying heterogeneous grassland canopies. Here, the potential of radiative transfer modeling to predict LAI and leaf and canopy chlorophyll contents in a heterogeneous Mediterranean grassland is investigated. The widely used PROSAIL model was inverted with canopy spectral reflectance measurements by means of a look-up table (LUT). Canopy spectral measurements were acquired in the field using a GER 3700 spectroradiometer, along with simultaneous in situ measurements of LAI and leaf chlorophyll content. We tested the impact of using multiple solutions, stratification (according to species richness), and spectral subsetting on parameter retrieval. To assess the performance of the model inversion, the normalized RMSE and R-2 between independent in situ measurements and estimated parameters were used. Of the three investigated plant characteristics, canopy chlorophyll content was estimated with the highest accuracy (R-2 = 0.70, NRMSE = 0.18). Leaf chlorophyll content, on the other hand, could not be estimated with acceptable accuracy, while LAI was estimated with intermediate accuracy (R-2 = 0.59, NRMSE = 0.18). When only sample plots with up to two species were considered (n = 107), the estimation accuracy for all investigated variables (LAI, canopy chlorophyll content and leaf chlorophyll content) increased (NRMSE=0.14, 0.16, 0.19, respectively). This shows the limits of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model in the case of very heterogeneous conditions. We also found that a carefully selected spectral subset contains sufficient information for a successful model inversion. Our results confirm the potential of model inversion for estimating vegetation biophysical parameters at the canopy scale in (moderately) heterogeneous grasslands using hyperspectral measurements.

AB The emerald ash borer (EAB) is an exotic insect pest currently threatening ash species in the Great Lakes region. Because of the potential impact on forests in this area, multiple government agencies are currently focusing their efforts on developing new technologies to detect, monitor and control this insect pest. Previous work has shown that hyperspectral remote sensing technologies can produce detailed maps of forest health and species abundance on a landscape scale. This study examines the capability of a commercially available sensor (SpecTIR VNIR) to map ash decline due to exotic EAB infestations in Michigan and Ohio. A 6-term linear regression equation based on known stress- and chlorophyll-sensitive indices was able to predict decline on a continuous 0- to 10 scale with an r-squared of 0.71 and an average jackknifed residual of 0.61. Treated as an integer, decline was predicted to within one class with 97% accuracy. The ability of this instrument to assess decline below class 4 (when dieback and transparency reach levels first noticeable in the field) is based upon pre-visual reductions in chlorophyll content and function that are characteristic of early stress. The identification of early stress is critical in containing newly introduced exotics such as EAB. While this decline prediction technique is not stress- or species-specific, it will enable land managers to assess and monitor detailed forest health across the landscape. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB The fort-nation of meltponds on the surface of sea ice during summer is one of the main factors affecting variability in surface albedo over the ice cover. However, observations of the spatial extent of ponding are rare. To address this, a MODIS surface reflectance product is used to derive the daily melt pond cover over sea ice in the Beaufort/Chukchi Sea region through the summer of 2004. For this region, the estimated pond cover increased rapidly during the first 20 days of melt from 10% to 40%. Fluctuations in pond cover occurred through summer, followed by a more gradual decrease through late August to 10%. The rapid initial increase in pond cover occurred later as latitude increased and melt progressed northward.
   A surface campaign at Barrow in June 2004 provided pond and ice spectral reflectance needed by the MODIS algorithm to deduce pond coverage. Although individual pond and ice reflectance varies within the comparatively small region of measurement, the mean values used within the algorithm ensured that relevant values (i.e. concurrent with satellite observations) were being applied.
   Aerosonde unpiloted aerial vehicles (UAVs) were deployed in June 2004 from Barrow, Alaska, to photograph the sea ice so melt pond cover could be estimated. Although the agreement between derived pond cover from UAV photos and estimates from MODIS varies, the mean estimates and distribution of pond coverages are similar, suggesting that the MODIS technique is useful for estimating pond coverage throughout the region. It is recommended that this technique be applied to the entire Arctic through the melt season. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Crop residues on the soil surface decrease soil erosion and increase soil organic carbon and the management of crop residues is an integral part of many conservation tillage systems. Current methods of measuring residue cover are inadequate for characterizing the spatial variability of residue cover over large fields. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of water content on the remotely sensed estimates of crop residue cover and to propose a method to mitigate the effects of water content on remotely sensed estimates of crop residue cover. Reflectance spectra of crop residues and soils were measured in the lab over the 400-2400 nm wavelength region. Reflectance of scenes with various residue cover fractions and water contents was simulated using a linear mixture model. Additional spectra of scenes with mixtures of crop residues and soil were also acquired in corn, soybean, and wheat fields with different tillage treatments and different water content conditions. Crop residue cover was linearly related to the cellulose absorption index (CAI), which was defined as the relative intensity of an absorption feature near 2100 nm. Water in the crop residue significantly attenuated CAI and changed the slope of the residue cover vs. CAI relationship. Without an appropriate correction, crop residue covers were underestimated as scene water content increased. Spectral vegetation water indices were poorly related to changes in the water contents of crop residues and soils. A new reflectance ratio water index that used the two bands located on the shoulders of the cellulose absorption feature to estimate scene water conditions was proposed and tested with data from corn, soybean, and wheat fields. The ratio water index was used to describe the changes in the slope of crop residue cover vs. CAI and improve the predictions of crop residue cover. These results indicate that spatial and temporal adjustments in the spectral estimates of crop residue cover are possible. Current mutispectral imaging systems will not provide reliable estimates of crop residue cover when scene water content varies. Hyperspectral data are not required, because the three narrow bands that are used for both CAI and the scene moisture correction could be incorporated in advanced multispectral sensors. Thus, regional surveys of soil conservation practices that affect soil carbon dynamics may be feasible using either advanced multispectral or hyperspectral imaging systems.

AB We present a new method for the extraction of roughness parameters of sand ripples on exposed tidal flats from mufti-frequency synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The method is based on the Integral Equation Model (IEM) which predicts the normalized radar cross-section (MRCS) of randomly rough dielectric surfaces. The data used for this analysis were acquired in the German Bight of the North Sea by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band SAR (SIR-C/X-SAR) in 1994. In-situ measurements of the root-mean-squared (rms) height and the correlation length of the sand ripples clearly demonstrate a relationship between these roughness parameters and the C-band NRCS determined from an ERS SAR image. Using the IEM we have calculated NRCS isolines for the three frequency bands deployed by SIR-C/X-SAR (L, C, and X band), as a function of the rms height and the correlation length of the sand ripples. For each SIR-C/X-SAR image pixel these two roughness parameters were determined from the intersections of the NRCS isolines at different radar bands, and they were used for a crude sediment classification for a small test area at the German North Sea coast. Comparing our results with available sediment maps, we conclude that the presented method is very promising for tidal flat classification by using data from presently existing airborne and future spaceborne mufti-frequency SAR systems.

AB Field data describing the height growth of trees or stands over several decades are very scarce. Consequently, our capacity of analyzing forest dynamics over large areas and long periods of time is somewhat limited. This study proposes a new method for retrospectively reconstructing plot-wise average dominant tree height based on a time series of high-resolution canopy height maps, termed canopy height models (CHMs). The absolute elevation of the canopy surface, or digital surface model (DSM), was first reconstructed by applying image-matching techniques to stereo-pairs of aerial photographs acquired in 1945, 1965, 1983, and 2003. The historical CHMs were then created by subtracting the bare earth elevation provided from a recent lidar survey from the DSMs. A method for estimating average dominant tree height from these historical CHMs was developed and calibrated for each photographic year. The accuracy of the resulting remote sensing height estimates was compared to age height data reconstructed based on dendrometric measurements. The height bias of the remote sensing estimates relative to the verification data ranged from 0.52 in to 1.55 m (1.16 m on average). The corresponding root-mean-square errors varied between 1.49 m and 2.88 m (2.03 m average). Despite being slightly less accurate than historical field data, the quality of the remote sensing estimates is sufficient for many types of forest dynamics studies. The procedures for implementing this method, with the exception of the calibration phase, are entirely automated such that forest height growth curves can be reconstructed and mapped over large areas for which recent lidar data and historical photographs exist.

AB The goal of this study is to evaluate the relative usefulness of high spectral and temporal resolutions of MODIS imagery data for land cover classification. In particular, we highlight the individual and combinatorial influence of spectral and temporal components of MODIS reflectance data in land cover classification. Our study relies on an annual time series of twelve MODIS 8-days composited images (MOD09Al) monthly acquired during the year 2000, at a 500 in nominal resolution. As our aim is not to propose an operational classifier directed at thematic mapping based on the most efficient combination of reflectance inputs - which will probably change across geographical regions and with different land cover nomenclatures - we intentionally restrict our experimental framework to continental Portugal. Because our observation data stream contains highly correlated components, we need to rank the temporal and the spectral features according not only to their individual ability at separating the land cover classes, but also to their differential contribution to the existing information. To proceed, we resort to the median Mahalanobis distance as a statistical separability criterion. Once achieved this arrangement, we strive to evaluate, in a classification perspective, the gain obtained when the dimensionality of the input feature space grows. We then successively embedded the prior ranked measures into the multitemporal and multispectral training data set of a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. In this way, we show that, only the inclusion of the approximately first three dates substantially increases the classification accuracy. Moreover, this multitemporal factor has a significant effect when coupled with combinations of few spectral bands, but it turns negligible as soon as the full spectral information is exploited. Regarding the multispectral factor, its beneficence on classification accuracy remains more constant, regardless of the number of dates being used. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

More specific objectives are to: (1) develop new lidar-derived features as multiband height bins and processing techniques for characterizing the vertical structure of individual tree crowns; (2) investigate several techniques for filtering and analyzing vertical profiles of individual trees to derive crown base height, such as Fourier and wavelet filtering, polynomial fit, and percentile analysis; (3) assess the accuracy of estimating crown base height for individual trees, and (4) investigate which type of lidar data, point frequency or intensity, provides the most accurate estimate of crown base height. A lidar software application, TreeVaW, was used to locate individual trees and to obtain per tree measurements of height and crown width. Tree locations were used with lidar height bins to derive the vertical structure of tree crowns and measurements of crown base height. Lidar-derived crown base heights of individual trees were compared to field observations for 117 trees, including 94 pines and 23 deciduous trees. Linear regression models were able to explain up to 80% of the variability associated with crown base height for individual trees. Fourier filtering used for smoothing the vertical crown profile consistently provided the best results when estimating crown base height. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Hyperspectral water retrievals from AVIRIS data, equivalent water thickness (EWT), were compared to in situ leaf water content and LAI measurements at a semiarid site in southeastern Arizona. Retrievals of EWT showed good correlation with field canopy water content measurements. Statistical analysis suggested that EWT was significantly different among seven community types, from savanna to agriculture. Four band-ratio indexes (NDVI, EVI, NDWI, and NDII) were derived from MODIS showing strong spatial agreement between maps of AVIRIS EWT and MODIS indexes, and good statistical agreement for the range of habitats at the site. Temporal patterns of these four indexes in all vegetation communities except creosote bush and agriculture showed distinct seasonal patterns that responded to the timing and amount of precipitation. Moreover, these time series captured different ecological responses among the different vegetation communities. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite sensor MODIS on two platforms can produce Sea Surface Temperature over certain regions about three to four times per day. Our objective was to test if the MODIS SST product can be applied for lakes whose surface areas are large enough to be observed at the MODIS spatial resolution and to compare the satellite-derived lake surface temperatures with in situ measurements. Surface temperatures for Lakes Vanern and Vattern in Sweden, two of the largest European lakes, are extracted from the MODIS/Terra images for period 2001-2003. The results are analyzed on different quality levels, as all MODIS L2 products are equipped with an additional quality flag. We present temperature development over 2001-2003, and show the capability of the MODIS SST product to couple the known thermodynamical features in the lakes under study, where temperature varies greatly with space and time. These results can complement lake monitoring programs anywhere. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We used LiDAR topographic data, AVIRIS hyperspectral data, and locally measured tidal fluctuations to characterize patterns of plant distribution within a southern California salt marsh (Carpinteria Salt Marsh (CSM)). LiDAR data required ground truthing and correction before they were suitable for use. Twenty to forty percent of the uncertainty associated with LiDAR was due to variance in the elevation of the target surface, the balance was attributed to error inherent in the LiDAR system. The incidence of LiDAR penetration of plant canopy cover (i.e., registration of ground elevation) was only three percent. The depth of LiDAR penetration into the plant canopy varied according to plant species composition; plant species-specific corrections significantly improved LiDAR accuracy (58% reduction in overall uncertainty) and with the use of ground-based surveys, reduced overall RMSE to an average of 6.3 cm in vegetated areas. A supervised classification of AVIRIS data was used to generate a vegetation map with six classification types; overall classification accuracy averaged 59% with a kappa coefficient of 0.40. The vegetation classification map was overlaid with a LiDAR-based digital elevation model (DEM) to compute elevation distributions and frequencies of tidal inundation. The average elevations of the dominant plant classifications found in CSM (e.g., Salicornia virginica,Jaumea carnosa, and salt-grass mix, a mixture of multiple marsh plant species) occurred within a 17 cm range, a vertical change that resulted in a 7% difference in the period of tidal inundation.

AB Since 2000, NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) has provided 1 x 1 km estimates of 8-day gross primary production (GPP). The MODIS algorithm computes GPP as a simple function of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and a regionally assigned light-use conversion efficiency (LUE) that is reduced if temperature or atmospheric vapor pressure deficits are suboptimal. We compared MODIS-derived GPP estimates for forested areas across the United States of America (U.S.A.) with those generated by the 3-PGS (Physiological Principles Predicting Growth using Satellite data) model, the latter of which considers spatial variation in available soil water storage capacity (ASWC) and nitrogen content. We expected seasonal and annual MODIS GPP values to be in close agreement with those derived from the 3-PGS model in regions with adequate precipitation, soil water storage, and moderately fertile soils. 3-PGS was initially run with STATSGO-derived soils information provided by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The analysis was expanded to include sensitivity analyses with ASWC set at 50, 100, 300, and 400 mm to identify areas within nine major ecoregions where drought might prove to be a major limitation on GPP. The majority of forests across the U.S.A. were relatively insensitive to large variations in ASW storage. In areas where ASWC was assumed < 200 mm and average annual rainfall was < 100 mm yr(-1), GPP was predicted to be reduced by > 60%. There was generally good agreement (within 20%) between MODIS and 3-PGS estimates of forest GPP across the U.S.A. GPP predicted by the MODIS model was generally higher in ecoregions with substantial drought and with relatively low soil fertility. The latter, which influences LUE, was more than twice as important as soil drought. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Two different matrices are commonly reported in assessment of change detection accuracy: (1) single date error matrices and (2) binary change/ no change error matrices. The third, less common form of reporting, is the transition error matrix. This paper discuses the relation between these matrices. First, it is shown that the transition error matrix implicitly measures temporal correlation in classification errors. Based on two assumptions (no correlation, maximum correlation), the single date error matrices can be used to obtain a most pessimistic and most optimistic estimate of the transition accuracy. Next, it is shown that the change/no change error matrix does not quantify certain classification errors. It is shown that change/no change error matrix can be used complementary to the full transition error matrix in efforts to improve transition detection accuracy. Despite its advantages, the transition error matrix is only very rarely reported, while it is of interest to all those interested in the accuracy of transitions (from-to) in change detection.

AB Expert labels were used to evaluate arctic cloud detection accuracies of several methods based on MISR angular radiances and MODIS spectral radiances. The accuracy of cloud detections was evaluated relative to 5.086 million expert labels applied to 7.114 million 1.1-km resolution pixels with valid radiances from 57 scenes. The accuracy of the MODIS operational cloud mask was 90.72% for the 32 partly cloudy scenes and 93.37% for the 25 completely clear and overcast scenes. An automated, simple threshold algorithm based on three features extracted from MISR radiances and the MODIS operational cloud mask agreed with each other for 74.91% of the pixels in the 32 partly cloudy scenes and 78.44% of the pixels in the 25 completely clear and overcast scenes. These subsets of pixels had, relative to the expert labels, classification accuracies of 96.53% for the 32 partly cloudy scenes and 99.05% for the 25 completely clear and overcast scenes. Fisher's quadratic discriminate analysis (QDA) trained on expert labels from the 32 partly cloud scenes was applied to MISR radiances, three features based on MISR radiances, MODIS radiances, and the six features of the MODIS operational cloud mask with accuracies ranging from 87.51% to 96.43%. Accuracies increased to about 97% when QDA with expert labels was applied to combined radiances or features from both MISR and MODIS. Operational QDA-based classifiers were developed using as training labels those pixels for which the MISR automated, simple threshold and MODIS operational cloud mask algorithms agreed. Training the QDA classifier on these automatic labels using MISR radiances, three features based on MISR radiances, MODIS radiances, and the six features of the MODIS operational cloud mask led to accuracies ranging from 85.23% to 93.62% for the 32 partly cloudy scenes. Classification accuracies increased to 93.74% (93.40%) when combined MISR and MODIS radiances (features) were used. The highest accuracy attained with any operational algorithm tested on all 57 scenes was 94.51%. These results suggest that both MISR and MODIS radiances are sufficient for cloud detection in daytime polar regions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This work addressed the retrieval of Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) from combined mid-infrared and thermal infrared data of Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) onboard the geostationary satellite-Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). To correct for the atmospheric effects in satellite measurements, a new atmospheric correction scheme was developed for both Middle Infra-Red (MIR) and Thermal Infra-Red (TIR) channels. For the MIR channel, because it is less sensitive to the change of water vapor content, the clear-sky and time-nearest European Centre for Median-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) atmospheric data were used for the images where no atmospheric data are available. For TIR channels, a modified model of Diurnal Temperature Cycle (DTC) used by Gottsche and Olesen [Gottsche, F. M., and Olesen, F. S. (2001). Modeling of diurnal cycles of brightness temperature extracted from METEOSAT data. Remote Sensing of Environment, 76, 337-348.] and Schadlich et al. [Schadlich, S., Gottsche, F. M., and Olesen, F. S. (2001). Influence of land surface parameters and atmosphere on METEOSAT brightness Temperatures and generation of land surface temperature maps by temporally and spatially interpolating atmospheric correction. Remote Sensing of Environment, 75, 39-46.] was adopted. The separation of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and LSE is based on the concept of the Temperature Independent Spectral Indices (TISI) [Becker, F., and Li, Z. L. (1990a). Temperature independent spectral indices in thermal infrared bands. Remote Sensing of Environment, 32, 17-33.] constructed with one channel in MIR and one channel in TIR. The results of two different combinations (combination of channels 4 and 9 and of channels 4 and 10) and two successive days at six specific locations over North Africa show that the retrievals are consistent. The range of emissivity in MSG-SEVIRI channel 4 goes from 0.5 for bare areas to 0.96 for densely vegetated areas, whereas the emissivities in MSG-SEVIRI channels 9 and 10 are usually from 0.9 to 0.95 for bare areas and from 0.95 to 1.0 for vegetated areas. For densely vegetated areas, the emissivities in MSG-SEVIRI channel 9 are larger than the ones in channel 10, whereas the opposite is observed over bare areas. The rms differences between two combinations over the whole studied region are 0.017 for emissivity in channel 4, 0.008 for emissivity in channel 9 and 0.007 for emissivity in channel 10.

AB We tested image texture as a predictor of bird species richness in a semi-arid landscape of New Mexico. Bird species richness was summarized from 10-min point counts conducted at 12 points within 42 plots (108 ha each) from 1996 to 1998. We calculated 14 first- and second-order texture measures in eight different window sizes on a set of digital orthophotos acquired in 1996. For each of the 42 plots, we summarized mean and standard deviation of each texture value within multiple window sizes. The relationship between image texture and average bird species richness was assessed using linear regression models. Single image texture measures such as the standard deviation described up to 57% of the variability in species richness. Coupling multiple measures of texture or coupling elevation with a single texture measure described up to 63% of the variability in bird species richness. Models incorporating two measures of texture and coarse habitat type described 76% of the variability in bird species richness. These results show that image texture analysis is a very promising tool for characterizing habitat structure and predicting patterns of species richness in semi-arid ecosystems. This method has several advantages over methods that rely on classified imagery, including cost-effectiveness, incorporation of within-habitat vegetation variability, and elimination of errors associated with boundary delineation.

AB Mapping urban biophysical and thermal conditions has attracted increasing interest. However, the relationship between them has not been fully understood. This paper explores thermal features and their relationship with biophysical descriptors in an urban environment by analyzing multitemporal ASTER images. Linear spectral mixture analysis was used to unmix the five thermal infrared bands of ASTER into hot-object and cold-object fraction images and to unmix the nine visible, near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared bands into impervious surface, green vegetation, and soil fractions. Land surface temperatures (LSTs) were computed from band 13 (10.25-10.95 mu m) of the ASTER. Correlation analysis was then conducted to examine the relationship between LST and the five derived fraction variables across the spatial resolution of the pixels from the ASTER images, which ranged from 15 m to 90 m. Multiple regression models were further developed to reveal how LSTs were related to urban biophysical descriptors (i.e., impervious surface, green vegetation, and soil) and to the thermal feature fractions (i.e., hot-object and cold-object). Results indicate that impervious surface was positively correlated while vegetation was negatively correlated with LST. Hot objects displayed a more significant role in influencing LST patterns than cold objects. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, spectral indices were calculated from single date HyMap (3 m; 126 bands), Hyperion (30 m; 242 bands), ASTER (15/30 m; 9 bands), and a time series of MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR; 1 km, 7 bands) for a study area surrounding the Tumbarumba flux tower site in eastern Australia. The study involved: a) the calculation of a range of physiologically-based vegetation indices from ASTER, HyMap, Hyperion and MOD43B NBAR imagery over the flux tower site; b) comparison across scales between HyMap, Hyperion and MODIS for the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the Red-Green ratio; c) analysis of relationships between tower-based flux and light use efficiency (LUE) measurements and seasonal and climatic constraints on growth; and d) examination of relationships between fluxes, LUE and time series of NDVI, NDWI and Red-Green ratio. Strong seasonal patterns of variation were observed in NDWI and Red/Green ratio from MODIS NBAR. Correlations between fine (3 and 30 m) and coarse (1 km) scale indices for a small region around the flux tower site were moderately good for Red/Green ratio, but poor for NDWI. Hymap NDWI values for the understorey canopy were much lower than values for the tree canopy. MODIS NDWI was negatively correlated with CO2 fluxes during warm and cool seasons. The correlation indicated that surface reflectance, affected by a spectrally bright grassland understorey canopy, was decoupled from growth of trees with access to deep soil moisture. The application of physiologically-based indices at earth observation scale requires careful attention to applicability of band configurations, contribution of vegetation components to reflectance signals, mechanistic relationships between biochemical processes and spectral indexes, and incorporation of ancillary information into any analysis.

AB High spatial resolution remotely sensed data has the potential to complement existing forest health programs for both strategic planning over large areas, as well as for detailed and precise identification of tree crowns subject to stress and infestation. The area impacted by the current mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has increased 40-fold over the previous 5 years, with approximately 8.5 million ha of forest infested in 2005. As a result of the spatial extent and intensity of the outbreak, new technologies are being assessed to help detect, map, and monitor the damage caused by the beetle, and to inform mitigation of future beetle outbreaks. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of high spatial resolution QuickBird multi-spectral imagery to detect mountain pine beetle red attack damage. ANOVA testing of individual spectral bands, as well as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a ratio of red to green reflectance (Red-Green Index or RGI), indicated that the RGI was the most successful (p < 0.001) at separating non-attack crowns from red attack crowns. Based on this result, the RGI was subsequently used to develop a binary classification of red attack and non-attack pixels. The total number of QuickBird pixels classified as having red attack damage within a 50 in buffer of a known forest health survey point were compared to the number of red attack trees recorded at the time of the forest health survey. The relationship between the number of red attack pixels and observed red attack crowns was assessed using independent validation data and was found to be significant (r(2)=0.48, p < 0.001, standard error=2.8 crowns). A comparison of the number of QuickBird pixels classified as red attack, and a broader scale index of mountain pine beetle red attack damage (Enhanced Wetness Difference Index, calculated from a time series of Landsat imagery), was significant (r(2)=0.61, p < 0.001, standard error=1.3 crowns). These results suggest that high spatial resolution imagery, in particular QuickBird satellite imagery, has a valuable role to play in identifying tree crowns with red attack damage. This information could subsequently be used to augment existing detailed forest health surveys, calibrate synoptic estimates of red attack damage generated from over-view surveys and/or coarse scale remotely sensed data, and facilitate the generation of value-added information products, such as estimates of timber volume impacts at the forest stand level.

AB The Net Surface Shortwave Radiation (NSSR) is of primary interest in climate research because it controls the total energy exchange between the atmosphere and the land/ocean surface. The conventional methods for estimating NSSR rely on broadband satellite data such as Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) wide-field-of-view planetary albedo. The spatial resolution of the current ERBE satellite data having nadir footprints larger than 30 kin is too coarse. The primary objective of this study is to estimate NSSR using multispectral narrowband data such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A direct method was developed for narrowband-to-broadband albedo conversion, which links the narrowband apparent reflectance at the Top Of Atmosphere (TOA) to shortwave broadband albedo for clear and cloudy skies without performing any surface angular modeling. The conversion coefficients were derived as functions of the secant Viewing Zenith Angle (VZA) for a given Solar Zenith Angle (SZA) and a given interval of Relative Azimuth angle (RAA). The result of comparing the values of estimated MODIS TOA shortwave broadband albedos with those of the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data indicated that this direct method could predict TOA shortwave broadband albedo accurately with Root Mean Square (RMS) error between CERES observations and the estimated instantaneous MODIS TOA albedos less than 0.02. Based on more accurate radiative transfer model MODTRAN 4, the parameterization coefficients of Masuda et al. for the estimation of the NSSR from TOA broadband albedo were recalculated. The result showed that the coefficients should be categorized by land surfaces, ocean surface and snow/ice surface, respectively. Finally, the NSSR estimated from MODIS data was compared with the measurements of meteorological data for an extended period of time covering all seasons in a year 2003. The RMS error is less than 20 Win 2 for clear skies and 35 Win 2 for cloudy skies. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Long term observations of global vegetation from multiple satellites require much effort to ensure continuity and compatibility due to differences in sensor characteristics and product generation algorithms. In this study, we focused on the bandpass filter differences and empirically investigated cross-sensor relationships of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and reflectance. The specific objectives were: 1) to understand the systematic trends in cross-sensor relationships of the NDVI and reflectance as a function of spectral bandpasses, 2) to examine/ identify the relative importance of the spectral features (i.e., the green peak, red edge, and leaf liquid water absorption regions) in and the mechanism(s) of causing the observed systematic trends, and 3) to evaluate the performance of several empirical cross-calibration methods in modeling the observed systematic trends. A Level 1A Hyperion hyperspectral image acquired over a tropical forest-savanna transitional region in Brazil was processed to simulate atmospherically corrected reflectances and NDVI for various bandpasses, including Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), NOAA-14 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVERR), and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Data were extracted from various land cover types typically found in tropical forest and savanna biomes and used for analyses. Both NDVI and reflectance relationships among the sensors were neither linear nor unique and were found to exhibit complex patterns and bandpass dependencies. The reflectance relationships showed strong land cover dependencies. The NDVI relationships, in contrast, did not show land cover dependencies, but resulted in nonlinear forms. From sensitivity analyses, the green peak (similar to 550 nm) and red-NIR transitional (680-780 nm) features were identified as the key factors in producing the observed land cover dependencies and nonlinearity in cross-sensor relationships. In particular, differences in the extents to which the red and/or NIR bandpasses included these features significantly influenced the forms and degrees of nonlinearity in the relationships. Translation of MODIS NDVI to "AVHRR-like" NDVI using a weighted average of MODIS green and red bands performed very poorly, resulting in no reduction of overall discrepancy between MODIS and AVHRR NDVI. Cross-calibration of NDVI and reflectance using NDVI-based quadratic functions performed well, reducing their differences to +/- .025 units for the NDVI and +/- .01 units for the reflectances; however, many of the translation results suffered from bias errors. The present results suggest that distinct translation equations and coefficients need to be developed for every sensor pairs and that land cover-dependency need to be explicitly accounted for to reduce bias errors.

AB This paper aims to link the spectral and directional variations of the leaf Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) by differentiating specular and diffuse components. To do this, BRDF of laurel (Prunus laurocesarus), European beech (Fagus silvatica) and hazel (Corylus avellana) leaves were measured at 400 'wavelengths evenly spaced over the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) domains (480-880 nm) and at 400 source-leaf-sensor configurations. Measurement analysis suggested a spectral invariance of the specular component, the directional shape of which was mainly driven by leaf surface roughness. A three-parameter physically based model was fitted on the BRDF at each wavelength, confirming the spectral invariance of the specular component in the VIS, followed by a slight deterioration in the NIR. Due to this component, the amount of reflected light which did not penetrate into the leaf, could be considered as significant at wavelengths of chlorophyll absorption. Finally, by introducing the PROSPECT model, we proposed a five-parameter model to simulate leaf spectral and bidirectional reflectance in the VIS-NIR. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB High resolution, synoptic information on sediment characteristics of intertidal flats is required for coastal management, e.g., for habitat mapping and dredging studies. This study aims to derive such information from space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Estimates of the backscattering coefficient were extracted from ERS-1 SAR and ERS-2 SAR PRI imagery of four intertidal flats in the Westerschelde (southwest Netherlands). They were related to field measurements of surface roughness, moisture conditions and sediment texture. The field data were also used as input to the backscattering model IEM. The data and model predictions show that on the intertidal flats, backscattering depends mainly on vertical surface roughness, with rougher surfaces associated with more backscattering. Surface roughness, mainly determined by the ripple structure of the bed, decreased with the amount of mud in the sediment. This resulted in a significant negative correlation between backscattering and mud content, and a significant positive correlation between backscattering and median grain-size of the sediment. Sediment texture was also correlated with the volumetric moisture content of the sediment, with finer sediments being associated with higher moisture contents. However, moisture contents were generally high, and therefore the backscatter signal was not sensitive to differences in moisture content. The relationships allowed the development of regression models for the prediction of surface characteristics from SAR imagery, from which maps of, for example, mud content, have been derived.

AB Daily time-step normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series from satellite-derived (NOAA/AVHRR, SPOT/ VEGETATION, TERRA/MODIS) and ground-based micrometeorological sensors were evaluated for a coniferous pine forest (Pinus sylvestris L.) located in Hyytiala, Finland. Micrometeorology-based broadband NDVI was calculated from observed upward and downward photosynthetically activity radiation (PAR) and global radiation measurements. The composite satellite-derived NDVI time series were smoothed with a best index slope extraction method (BISE) and adjusted Fourier transform (AFT) in order to downscale from the compositing period to daily scale.
   The broadband and satellite-derived NDVIs were highly correlated during the main growth period (Julian days 90-270), but poorly correlated when the entire year was considered, i.e., large differences occurred during winter. High correlations were also found between the seasonal courses for broadband NDVI and daily air temperature. The analysis revealed that the onset of greenness in spring was consistently determined from broadband NDVI time series in different years, but that fluctuations in NDVI during the late season transition to winter dormancy prevented reliable prediction of the termination in physiological activity. Efforts to retrieve the same relationships during spring from satellite-derived NDVI failed.
   After comparing the smoothed time series from different NDVI determinations, we examined the relationship between NDVI, gross primary production (GPP) and FAPAR. An obvious exponential relationship is found between broadband NDVI and GPP (R-2=0.72 for clear weather conditions; also detectable from the satellite sensors), while a linear relationship occurs between broadband NDVI and FAPAR (R-2=0.79). FAPAR in relation to satellite-derived NDVI is best described with a logistic curve under clear weather conditions, but the level of correspondence is low (R-2=0.53). Overall, broadband NDVI is a good index to describe physiological activity of the pine forest during certain periods, i.e. provides a means for obtaining other physiological parameters that are required by ecosystem models. However, during the late season, broadband NDVI estimated over the pine stand is influenced by more than vegetation physiological activity. Though satellite-derived NDVI is more difficult to link to GPP, it may still provide useful information under clear weather conditions. Satellite-derived NDVI remains our only choice for generalization in large-scale investigations. Thus, intensified examination of the influences of smoothing and downscaling of satellite-derived NDVI is inevitable. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Plant foliage density expressed as leaf area index (LAI) is used in many ecological, meteorological, and agronomic models, and as a means of quantifying crop spatial variability for precision fanning. LAI retrieval using spectral vegetation indices (SVI) from optical remotely sensed data usually requires site-specific calibration values from the surface or the use of within-scene image information without surface calibrations to invert radiative transfer models. An evaluation of LAI retrieval methods was conducted using (1) empirical methods employing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and a new SVI that uses green wavelength reflectance, (2) a scaled NDVI approach that uses no calibration measurements, and (3) a hybrid approach that uses a neural network (NN) and a radiative transfer model without site-specific calibration measurements. While research has shown that under a variety of conditions NDVI is not optimal for LAI retrieval, its continued use for remote sensing applications and in analysis seeking to develop improved parameter retrieval algorithms based on NDVI suggests its value as a "benchmark" or standard against which other methods can be compared. Landsat-7 ETM+ data for July I and July 8 from the Soil Moisture EXperiment 2002 (SMEX02) field campaign in the Walnut Creek watershed south of Ames, IA, were used for the analysis. Sun photometer data collected from a site within the watershed were used to atmospherically correct the imagery to surface reflectance. LAI validation measurements of corn and soybeans were collected close to the dates of the Landsat-7 overpasses. Comparable results were obtained with the empirical SVI methods and the scaled SVI method within each date. The hybrid method, although promising, did not account for as much of the variability as the SVI methods. Higher atmospheric optical depths for July 8 leading to surface reflectance errors are believed to have resulted in overall poorer performance for this date. Use of SVIs employing green wavelengths, improved method for the definition of image minimum and maximum clusters used by the scaled NDVI method, and further development of a soil reflectance index used by the hybrid NN approach are warranted. More importantly, the results demonstrate that reasonable LAI estimates are possible using optical remote sensing methods without in situ, site-specific calibration measurements.

AB Estimating the water status of vegetation is one of the most important elements in assessing forest fire danger. In this paper, laboratory measurement confirmed a relationship between leaf water status and the normalized difference water index (NDWI), derived from near-infrared and shortwave-infrared spectral data. Two results were confirmed: (a) NDWI is related to equivalent water thickness, and, (b) in addition to NDWI, the quantity of leaf material must be known in order to estimate vegetation dryness. Based on these findings, the authors developed a vegetation dryness index (VDI) to estimate global vegetation water content. VDI values, calculated by using SPOT/VEGETATION data, were applied to data from a 1998 forest fire in the Russian Far East. This led to two results: (a) VDI was useful for detecting areas with a high potential for ignition, and (b) VDI may have been able to detect the fire-spread direction. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

ID HEIGHT; LIDAR
AB This paper demonstrates the applicability of small footprint, high sampling density airborne laser scanners for boreal forest change detection, i.e. the estimation of forest growth and monitoring of harvested trees. Two laser acquisitions were carried out on a test site using a Toposys-1 laser scanner. Three-dimensional canopy height models were calculated for both data sets using raster-based algorithms. Object-oriented algorithms were developed for detecting harvested and fallen trees, and for measuring forest growth at plot and stand levels. Out of 83 field-checked harvested trees, 61 could be automatically and correctly detected. All mature harvested trees were detected; it was mainly the smaller trees that were not. Forest growth was demonstrated at plot and stand levels using an object-oriented tree-to-tree matching algorithm and statistical analysis. The precision of the estimated growth, based on field checking or statistical analysis, was about 5 cm at stand level and about 10-15 cm at plot level. The authors expect that the methods may be feasible in large area forest inventories that make use of permanent sample plots. Together with methods for detecting individual sample trees, the methods described may be used to replace a large number of permanent plots with laser scanning techniques. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB A scheme to discriminate and identify materials having overlapping spectral absorption features has been developed and tested based on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Tetracorder system. The scheme has been applied to remotely sensed imaging spectroscopy data acquired by the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument. This approach was used to identify the minerals calcite, epidote, and chlorite in the upper Animas River watershed, Colorado. The study was motivated by the need to characterize the distribution of calcite in the watershed and assess its acid-neutralizing potential with regard to acidic mine drainage. Identification of these three minerals is difficult because their diagnostic spectral features are all centered at 2.3 mum, and have similar shapes and widths. Previous studies overestimated calcite abundance as a result of these spectral overlaps. The use of a reference library containing synthetic mixtures of the three minerals in varying proportions was found to simplify the task of identifying these minerals when used in conjunction with a rule-based expert system. Some inaccuracies in the mineral distribution maps remain, however, due to. the influence of a fourth spectral component, sericite, which exhibits spectral absorption features at 2.2 and 2.4 mum that overlap the 2.3-mum absorption features of the other three minerals. Whereas the endmember minerals calcite, epidote, chlorite, and sericite can be identified by the method presented here, discrepancies occur in areas where all four occur together as intimate mixtures. It is expected that future work will be able to reduce these discrepancies by including reference mixtures containing sericite. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For a data set collected around Baja California with chlorophyll-a concentration ((chl-a)) ranging from 0.16 to 11.3 mg/m(3), hyperspectral absorption spectra of phytoplankton pigments were independently inverted from hyperspectral remote-sensing reflectance using a newly developed ocean-color algorithm. The derived spectra were then compared with those measured from water samples using the filter-pad technique, and an average difference of 21.4% was obtained. These results demonstrate that the inversion algorithm worked quite well for the coastal waters observed and suggest a potential of using hyperspectral remote sensing to retrieve both chlorophyll-a and other accessory pigments.

AB The effect of soil surface texture on spectral reflectance is reported for a site in the Mojave Desert. Abandoned central-pivot agricultural fields in the Manix Basin of southeastern California have introduced deflationary surfaces into the otherwise stable, armored desert surface. This has resulted in sand plumes, eroded from the fields by wind, transported by saltation, and deposited downwind of the fields. Grain size analysis of this wind-transported material reveals a fractionation by size within the plume, with smaller effective particle size toward the toe of the plume. This fractionation results from the greater mobility of smaller particles, and the longer saltation paths they take once airborne. Radiative transfer modeling of quartz grains with absorbing rinds indicates that the differences in grain size observed in the field should be revealed in apparent surface reflectance and are resolvable within the noise-equivalent delta-reflectance of the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) instrument. Analysis of AVIRIS-derived apparent surface reflectance demonstrates the expected negative correlation between effective grain size of sand in the plume and reflectance, with the most significant correlations in the short-wave infrared. The change in reflectance per mm change in particle diameter was -0.06 at lambda similar to 1.7 mum and -0.08 at lambda similar to 2.2 mum with R-2 = 0.89 and 0.93, respectively.

The successful commercial launches of the IKONOS, QuickBird, and OrbView-3 satellites in 1999, 2001, and 2003, respectively, combined with commercial airborne sensors such as the Positive Systems ADAR 5500 (multi spectral), the Intermap STAR-3i (interferometric synthetic aperture radar), and TerraPoint, LLC, LIDAR System have ushered in an era of expanded capability and capacity for the field of remote sensing of our Earth. Remote sensing data from commercial sensors offer the public and private geospatial information communities important new sources of timely and accurate spatial information that can augment data provided by public-sector remote sensing systems. Several Federal agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the U.S. Geological Survey, and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), have established data purchase programs and related activities to access, evaluate, and assimilate new commercial remote sensing products to serve research and operational requirements. Plans for future commercial systems and data products indicate an expanding set of data types using hyperspectral, radar, LIDAR, and microwave technologies. The availability of new data sources has established the basis for Federal programs to provide for systematic characterization of the products, consistent with the characterization of data products enabled by traditional sources that include Landsat, SPOT, and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), An overview of commercial remote sensing initiatives within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the U.S. Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and of their Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (JACIE) team, illustrates these points, highlights lessons learned from these activities, and outlines recommendations for the future.

AB The Space Imaging IKONOS observatory may provide an important benefit in terrestrial scientific research. The five-band, I in panchromatic and 4 in multispectral measurements have the potential to provide a source of measurements to evaluate subpixel land cover variability in measurements from observatories such as Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Terra MODIS sensor. The IKONOS observations are at a spatial scale equivalent to field measurements typically carried out in ecological and land cover research. As such, the IKONOS observations may serve as a source of "virtual" ground measurements, for the lower spatial resolution, global observatories.
   In this study we examine how well IKONOS sensor observations replicate Landsat 7 ETM+ visible/near infrared observations for selected Earth Observation System (EOS) validation sites in the United States. The sites examined-Beltsville, MD, Konza Prairie, KS, and Sevilleta, NM-sample the east-west moisture gradient across the United States. Observations for each site were acquired, as nearly time-coincident as possible, from ETM+ and the IKONOS sensor, several times over the growing season. This was done to insure that we compared these two sensors over the widest range of observing conditions possible.
   We also examined IKONOS imagery from Phoenix, AZ, where Space Imaging had and had not applied a modulation transfer function compensation (MTFC) process. The MTFC is their standard product. We found that this product, at the original 4 in spatial resolution, appears to have minor radiometric artifacts as a result of the process. When the IKONOS observations were aggregated to 30 in, this problem was essentially absent, allowing us to proceed with the remainder of our, study.
   We processed the IKONOS sensor and ETM+ measurements to produce close approximates of each other. Our processing steps included ortho-rectification, calibration to planetary reflectance, pixel alignment and pixel aggregation. We initially found radiometric differences between the two sensors that increased with increasing wavelength. Space Imaging updated their calibration information, based on analyses from NASA Stennis Space Center staff, which removed much of this discrepancy. We now find that the IKONOS red and near infrared measurements differ between the two sensors, with IKONOS generally producing higher reflectance in the red band and lower reflectance in the near infrared band than the Landsat 7 ETM+ sensor. This results in the IKONOS sensor producing lower spectral vegetation index measurements, for the same target, than ETM+, a measurement variation that has been observed between other sensors.
   We also encountered far more cirrus cloud (and shadow) contamination in these paired observations that we had expected. After careful initial selection, we lost over half of our image pairs from the analysis because of cirrus cloud contamination. We do not know whether this is simply because of the paired, comparative design of this study or whether it relates to the increased spatial and radiometric resolution of the IKONOS sensor. The results of this study not only provide a baseline assessment of IKONOS versus Landsat 7 ETM+ visible and near infrared measurements but also suggest some of the issues that need more attention when comparing other sensor systems as well as developing the design of future land observatories.
