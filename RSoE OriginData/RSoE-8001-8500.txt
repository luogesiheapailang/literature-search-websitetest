TI Spatial and temporal variations of summer surface temperatures of wet

AB The surface temperature of permafrost soils in remote arctic areas is accessible by satellite land surface temperature (LST) detection However, the spatial resolution of satellite measurements such as the MODIS LST products is limited and does not detect the heterogeneities of the wet polygonal tundra landscape where surface wetness vanes over distances of several meters This paper examines the spatial and temporal variability of summer surface temperatures of a polygonal tundra site in northern Siberia using a ground based high resolution thermal imaging system. Thermal infrared images were taken of a 1000 m(2) polygonal tundra area in 10 min intervals from July to September 2008 Under clear sky conditions, the individual measurements indicate temperature differences of up to 6 K between dry and wet tundra surfaces and which can exceed 12 K when dry tundra and water surfaces are compared These differences disappear when temperature averages are considered for intervals longer than the diurnal cycle, for weekly averages the spatial temperature variability decreases below 1 K The exception is the free water surface of a shallow polygonal pond where weekly averaged temperature differences of 25 K are sustained compared to the tundra surface.
   The ground based thermal infrared images are upscaled to MODIS sized pixels and compared to available MODIS LST data for individual measurements and weekly averages The comparisons show generally good agreement for the individual measurements under clear sky conditions, which exist during 20% of the studied time period However, several erroneous measurements and large data gaps occur in the MODIS LST data during cloudy conditions, leading to biased weekly temperature averages inferred from the satellite observations Based on these results the following recommendations are given for future permafrost temperature monitoring based on MODIS LST products (i) high resolution surface water masks for the quality assessment in landscapes where lakes and ponds are frequent and (ii) reliable cloud cover detection in conjunction with a gap filling procedure for accurate temporal averages.

AB A multi-component satellite remote sensing program is required to track the response of the world's oceans, lakes and rivers to climate change. Central to this endeavor is the ability to detect the motions of internal waves, swell waves and currents and hence follow energy transport and exchange. However, the present methods of monitoring the motions of water bodies from space, such as those based on altimetry or gravity measurements, are geared mostly toward applications on large spatial scales, whereas the capacity to map the fine details of hydrospheric flows is limited. This paper describes a satellite-based method of detecting wave motion and surface currents at high (in principle metric) resolution that can be applied under specific circumstances in the confined environs of narrow sea straits, lakes and rivers and that compliments the use of other high-spatial resolution techniques such as those based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). The Along-Track Stereo Sun Glitter (ATSSG) technique makes use of images of water bodies that are separated in time by roughly 1 min and are gathered in the forward-, nadir- and backward-looking directions by space-borne optical sensors performing along-track observations. When sensor viewing geometries lead to the presence of Sun glitter in these images, surface slicks, internal waves, swell waves and other phenomena become highlighted through the surface roughness changes they induce, since these in turn modulate the reflected glitter radiance. Measurement of the differential displacements between congruent sections of the surface roughness signatures present within image pairs of the stereoscopic sequence then enables internal wave or swell wave motions to be determined, while surface currents can be deduced if "passive" tracers of the flow in the form of surface roughness structures (such as slicks) are present. The application of the ATSSG technique described herein makes use of data acquired at a spatial resolution of 2.5 m by the Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) to provide the first along-track fine-scale synoptic mapping of the surface motions of individual components within a large group of internal waves and to generate supporting surface-current measurements. The PRISM data we employ were acquired to the south of the Lombok Strait (Indonesia), where highly energetic internal-wave growth takes place and where through-flow surface-current data, of the type derived by the ATSSG technique, can be of value in climate studies.

AB Understory vegetation is an important component in forest ecosystems not only because of its contributions to forest structure, function and species composition, but also due to its essential role in supporting wildlife species and ecosystem services. Therefore, understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of understory vegetation is essential for management and conservation. Nevertheless, detailed information on the distribution of understory vegetation across large spatial extents is usually unavailable, due to the interference of overstory canopy on the remote detection of understory vegetation. While many efforts have been made to overcome this challenge, mapping understory vegetation across large spatial extents is still limited due to a lack of generality of the developed methods and limited availability of required remotely sensed data. In this study, we used understory bamboo in Wolong Nature Reserve, China as a case study to develop and test an effective and practical remote sensing approach for mapping understory vegetation. Using phenology metrics generated from a time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, we characterized the phenological features of forests with understory bamboo. Using maximum entropy modeling together with these phenology metrics, we successfully mapped the spatial distribution of understory bamboo (kappa: 0.59: AUC: 0.85). In addition, by incorporating elevation information we further mapped the distribution of two individual bamboo species, Bashania faberi and Fargesia robusta (kappa: 0.68 and 0.70; AUC: 0.91 and 0.92, respectively). Due to its generality, flexibility and extensibility, this approach constitutes an improvement to the remote detection of understory vegetation, making it suitable for mapping different understory species in different geographic settings. Both biodiversity conservation and wildlife habitat management may benefit from the detailed information on understory vegetation across large areas through the applications of this approach.

AB The ephemeral character of the radiative signal together with the presence of aerosols imposes severe limitations on the use of classical approaches, e.g. based on red and near-infrared, to discriminate between burned and unburned surfaces in tropical environments. Surface reflectance in the middle-infrared (MIR) has been used to circumvent these difficulties because the signal is virtually unaffected by the presence of aerosols associated to biomass burning. Retrieval of the MIR reflected component from the total signal is, however, a difficult problem because of the presence of a diversity of radiance sources, namely the surface reflected solar irradiance and the surface emitted radiance that may reach comparable magnitude during daytime. The method proposed by Kaufman and Remer (1994) to retrieve surface MIR reflectance presents the advantage of not requiring auxiliary datasets (e.g. atmospheric profiles) nor major computational means (e.g. for solving radiative transfer models). Nevertheless, the method was specifically designed to retrieve MIR reflectance over dense dark forests in the middle latitudes and, as shown in the present study, severe problems may arise when applying it beyond the range of validity, namely for burned area mapping in tropical environments. The present study consists of an assessment of the performance of the method for a wide range of atmospheric, geometric and surface conditions and of the usefulness of extracted surface reflectances for burned area discrimination. Results show that, in the case of tropical environments, there is a significant decrease in performance of the method for high values of land surface temperature, especially when associated with low sun elevation angles. Burned area discrimination is virtually impaired in such conditions, which are often present when using data from instruments on-board polar orbiters, namely MODIS in Aqua and Terra, to map burned surfaces over the Amazon forest and "cerrado" savanna regions.

AB High spatial and spectral resolution thermal infrared imagery (8.0-13.5 mu m) from the SEBASS airborne sensor was used to analyze and map tree canopy spectral features at the State Arboretum of Virginia, near Boyce, Virginia. Fifty tree species were analyzed and about half were directly identified with varying degrees of success on the basis of spectral matched filtering that utilized laboratory-measured leaf spectra as the target signatures. Spectral averages of pixels extracted from SEBASS emissivity data compared favorably with laboratory spectra of leaves collected from individual tree species. Best results were obtained from species having relatively strong spectral contrast, wide and flat leaves, closed planophile canopies, and/or large canopy areas. Tree species having small leaves or unfavorable leaf orientations showed spectral attenuation likely resulting from cavity blackbody effects. Increased spatial resolution and better image calibration and atmospheric correction might lead to further improvements in thermal infrared plant species identification. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Remote sensing hyperspectral sensors are important and powerful instruments for addressing classification problems in complex forest scenarios, as they allow one a detailed characterization of the spectral behavior of the considered information classes. However, the processing of hyperspectral data is particularly complex both from a theoretical viewpoint [e.g. problems related to the Hughes phenomenon (Hughes, 1968) and from a computational perspective. Despite many previous investigations that have been presented in the literature on feature reduction and feature extraction in hyperspectral data, only a few studies have analyzed the role of spectral resolution on the classification accuracy in different application domains. In this paper, we present an empirical study aimed at understanding the relationship among spectral resolution, classifier complexity, and classification accuracy obtained with hyperspectral sensors for the classification of forest areas. We considered two different test sets characterized by images acquired by an AISA Eagle sensor over 126 bands with a spectral resolution of 4.6 nm, and we subsequently degraded its spectral resolution to 9.2,13.8,18.4, 23, 27.6, 32.2 and 36.8 nm. A series of classification experiments were carried out with bands at each of the degraded spectral resolutions, and bands selected with a feature selection algorithm at the highest spectral resolution (4.6 nm). The classification experiments were carried out with three different classifiers: Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Maximum Likelihood with Leave-One-Out-Covariance estimator, and Linear Discriminant Analysis. From the experimental results, important conclusions can be made about the choice of the spectral resolution of hyperspectral sensors as applied to forest areas, also in relation to the complexity of the adopted classification methodology. The outcome of these experiments are also applicable in terms of directing the user towards a more efficient use of the current instruments (e.g. programming of the spectral channels to be acquired) and classification techniques in forest applications, as well as in the design of future hyperspectral sensors.

AB Various types of floating algae have been reported in open oceans and coastal waters, yet accurate and timely detection of these relatively small surface features using traditional satellite data and algorithms has been difficult or even impossible due to lack of spatial resolution, coverage, revisit frequency, or due to inherent algorithm limitations. Here, a simple ocean color index, namely the Floating Algae Index (FAI), is developed and used to detect floating algae in open ocean environments using the medium-resolution (250- and 500-m) data from operational MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments. FAI is defined as the difference between reflectance at 859 nm (vegetation "red edge") and a linear baseline between the red band (645 nm) and short-wave infrared band (1240 or 1640 nm). Through data comparison and model simulations, FAI has shown advantages over the traditional NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) or EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) because FAI is less sensitive to changes in environmental and observing conditions (aerosol type and thickness, solar/viewing geometry, and sun glint) and can "see" through thin clouds. The baseline subtraction method provides a simple yet effective means for atmospheric correction, through which floating algae can be easily recognized and delineated in various ocean waters, including the North Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea. Because similar spectral bands are available on many existing and planned satellite sensors such as Landsat TM/ETM+ and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imager/Radiometer Suite), the FAI concept is extendable to establish a long-term record of these ecologically important ocean plants.

AB The concept for a multi-spectral, full-waveform canopy LiDAR instrument was tested by simulating return waveforms using a model providing ecological sound tree structure (TREEGROW) and a model of leaf optical properties (PROSPECT). The proposed instrument will take measurements at four different wavelengths, which were chosen according to physiological processes altering leaf reflectance and transmittance. The modelling was used to assess both the structural and physiological information content such an instrument could provide, especially whether the normally structure-dominated return waveform would pick up small changes in reflectance at the leaf level. Multi-spectral waveforms were simulated for models of single Scots pine trees of different ages and at different stages of the growing season, including chlorophyll concentration induced changes in leaf optical properties. It was shown that the LiDAR waveforms would not only capture the tree height information, but would also pick up the seasonal and vertical variation of NDVI computed from two of the four MSCL wavelengths inside the tree canopy. The instrument concept was further tested in a simulation of a virtual forest stand constructed of 74 trees of different ages according to measurements taken on a field site being 20 by 20 meter in size. A total of 1521 NDVI profiles were computed and mean NDVI corrected backscatter was compared to the actual canopy profile of the virtual stand. The profiles picked up the seasonal variation of chlorophyll within the canopy, while the return of ground remained unchanged from June to September. Thus, it was shown that a MSCL instrument would be able to separately pick up the physiology of canopy and understorey and/or soil. It was found that occlusion would mask the lower parts of the canopy volume within the stand and the seasonal variation of this occlusion effect was quantified, being larger in September, when the absorption of canopy elements is higher. In addition, it could be demonstrated that a new multi-wavelength WAR predictor variable was able to significantly improve the retrieval accuracy of photosynthetically active biomass opposed to using a single-wavelength LiDAR alone.

AB We measured the light absorption properties of two naturally occurring Australian hydrocarbon oils, a Gippsland light crude oil and a North West Shelf light condensate. Using the results from these measurements in conjunction with estimated sensor environmental noise thresholds, the theoretical minimum limit of detectability of each oil type (as a function of oil thickness) was calculated for both the hyperspectral HYMAP and multispectral Quickbird sensors. The Gippsland crude oil is discernable at layer thickness of 20 pm or more in the Quickbird green channel. The HYMAP sensor was found to be theoretically capable of detecting a layer of Gippsland crude oil with a thickness of 10 pm in approximately six sensor channels. By contrast, the North West Shelf light condensate was not able to be detected by either sensor for any thickness up to 200 pm. Optical remote sensing is therefore not applicable for detecting diagnostic absorption features associated with this light condensate oil type, which is typical of the chemistry of many hydrocarbon oils found in the Australian Northwest Shelf area and condensates world wide. We conclude that oil type is critical to the applicability of optical remote sensing for natural oil slick detection and identification. We recommend that a sensor- and oil-specific sensitivity study should be conducted prior to applying optical remote sensors for oil exploration.
   The oil optical properties were obtained using two different laboratory methods, a reflectance-based approach and transmittance-based approach. The reflectance-based approach was relatively complex to implement, but was chosen in order to replicate as closely as possible real world remote sensing measurement conditions of an oil film on water. The transmittance-based approach, based upon standard laboratory spectrophotometric measurements was found to generate results in good agreement with the reflectance-based approach. Therefore, for future oil- and sensor-specific sensitivity studies, we recommend the relatively accessible transmittance-based approach, which is detailed in this paper.

AB Numerous studies have been conducted to compare the classification accuracy of coral reef maps produced from satellite and aerial imagery with different sensor characteristics such as spatial or spectral resolution, or under different environmental conditions. However, in additional to these physical environment and sensor design factors, the ecologically determined spatial complexity of the reef itself presents significant challenges for remote sensing objectives. While previous studies have considered the spatial resolution of the sensors, none have directly drawn the link from sensor spatial resolution to the scale and patterns in the heterogeneity of reef benthos. In this paper, we will study how the accuracy of a commonly used maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm is affected by spatial elements typical of a Caribbean atoll system present in high spectral and spatial resolution imagery.
   The results indicate that the degree to which ecologically determined spatial factors influence accuracy is dependent on both the amount of coral cover on the reef and the spatial resolution of the images being classified, and may be a contributing factor to the differences in the accuracies obtained for mapping reefs in different geographical locations. Differences in accuracy are also obtained due to the methods of pixel selection for training the maximum likelihood classification algorithm. With respect to estimation of live coral cover, a method which randomly selects training samples from all samples in each class provides better estimates for lower resolution images while a method biased to select the pixels with the highest substrate purity gave better estimations for higher resolution images.

AB Degradation of vegetation and soils in drylands, sometimes called desertification, is thought to be a serious threat to the sustainability of human habitation, but maps of the extent and severity of degradation at Country and global scales do not exist. Degraded land, by definition, has suffered a change relative to its previous condition set by its climate, soil properties, topography and expectations of land managers. The local net production scaling (LNS) method, tested here in Zimbabwe, estimates potential production in homogeneous land capability classes and models the actual productivity using remotely-sensed observations. The difference between the potential and actual productivities provides a map of the location and severity of degradation. Six years of 250 m resolution MODIS data were used to estimate actual net production in Zimbabwe and calculate the LNS using three land capability classifications. The LNS maps agreed with known areas of degradation and with an independent degradation map. The principal source of error arose because of inhomogeneity of some land capability classes caused by, for example, the inclusion of local hot-spots of high production and differences in precipitation caused by local topography. Agriculture and other management can affect the degradation estimates and careful inspection of the LNS maps is essential to verify and identify the local causes of degradation. The Zimbabwe study found that approximately 16% of the country was at its potential production and the total loss in productivity due to degradation was estimated to be 17.6 Tg Cyr(-1), that is 13% of the entire national potential. Since the locations of degraded land were unrelated to natural environmental factors such as rainfall and soils, it is clear that the degradation has been caused by human land use, concentrated in the heavily-utilized, communal areas.

AB Surface downwelling longwave radiation (LWDN) and surface net longwave radiation (LWNT) are two components in the surface radiation budget. In this study, we developed new linear and nonlinear models using a hybrid method to derive instantaneous clear-sky LWDN over land from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) TOA radiance at I km spatial resolution. The hybrid method is based on extensive radiative transfer simulation (physical) and statistical analysis (statistical). Linear and nonlinear models were derived at 5 sensor view zenith angles (0 degrees, 15 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees) to estimated LWDN using channels 27-29 and 31-34. Separate models were developed for daytime and nighttime observations. Surface pressure effect was considered by incorporating elevation in the models. The linear LWDN models account for more than 92% of variations of the simulated data sets, with standard errors less than 16.27 W/m(2) for all sensor view zenith angles. The nonlinear LWDN models explain more than 93% of variations, with standard errors less than 15.20 W/m(2). The linear and nonlinear LWDN models were applied to both Terra and Aqua TOA radiance and validated using ground data from six SURFRAD sites. The nonlinear models outperform the linear models at five sites. The averaged root mean squared errors (RMSE) of the nonlinear models are 17.60 W/m(2) (Terra) and 16.17 W/m2 (Aqua), with averaged RMSE -2.5 W/m(2) smaller than that of the linear models. LWNT was estimated using the nonlinear LWDN models and the artificial neural network (ANN) model method that predicts surface upwelling longwave radiation. LWNT was also validated using the same six SURFRAD sites. The averaged RMSEs are 17.72 (Terra) and 16.88 (Aqua) W/m(2); the averaged biases are -2.08 (Terra) and 1.99 (Aqua) W/m(2). The LWNT RMSEs are less than 20 W/m(2) for both Terra and Aqua observations at all sites. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The difference between aerosol optical depths (AODs) retrieved from the Multi-angle Imaging Spectro-Radiometer (MISR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS) is examined over mainland Southeast Asia from a spatial perspective. Though ideally the difference between these measurement methods should be small and randomly distributed over space, our analysis suggests that this difference has a strong negative relationship with MODIS AODs and tend to be spatially clustered. We quantify the spatial dependence in MISR/MODIS AOD differences and explore the extent to which the spatial patterns in these differences can be explained by variables that reflect the influence of physical environment and human activities. While these variables show a strong relationship with MISR/MODIS AOD differences, the results also suggest that further research is needed to fully understand the spatial dependence in these differences.

However, for erectophile dense crops (e.g. corn) the simulations appear less accurate. This inadequacy is due to the assumption that the Multiple scattered fluxes are isotropically distributed. The SAIL parameters are interpretable at the level of elementary layer components. Now, the adding method (initially proposed by Van de Hulst) provides a good framework to model the radiative transfer inside a vegetation layer, but its parameter estimation lies on very simple geometric modeling of the canopy. In this paper, we first propose an adaptation of the Adding method using the SAIL model canopy representation in the turbid case: it is called AddingS model. Such an approach allows to overcome the isotropy assumption. Second, AddingS is extended to the Discrete case: defining the AddingSDmodel. It allows to take into account the multi hot spot effect. Moreover, the AddingS and AddingSD models allow to check the energy conservation in respectively turbid and discrete cases. Finally, in order to keep reasonable time performance, a fast computation method was developed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Optical remote sensing allows to monitor the space and time heterogeneity of phytoplankton growth in marginal and enclosed seas, a factor critical to understanding their ecosystem dynamics. SeaWiFS-derived (1998-2003) data were used to monitor algal blooming patterns and anomalies in the Mediterranean basin. Yearly and monthly means of chlorophyll-like pigment concentration (chl) were computed for the 6 years available, and climatological means derived. The data set statistical variability was assessed by computing yearly and monthly chl anomalies, as the difference between each individual year/month and the corresponding climatological year/month. The space and time patterns of the chl field appear to concur with the Mediterranean general oceanographic climate, while the chl anomalies describe trends and "hotspots" of algal blooming. The analysis shows a general decrease of chl values in the yearly and monthly means, an increasing negative trend of chl anomalies over the basin interior, and the anticipation of the north-western spring bloom, in comparison to what seen in historical CZCS (1979-1985) data. These have been interpreted as symptoms of an increased nutrient-limitation, resulting from reduced vertical mixing due to a more stable stratification of the basin, in line with the general warming trend of the Mediterranean Sea in the last 25 years. The patterns of high chl, coupled to a positive trend of chl anomalies, recurring at near-coastal hotspots, appear to be linked to continental runoff and to a growing "biological dynamism" at these sites, i.e. to the intensification of noxious or harmful algal blooms, in the north-west, and of coastal fisheries, in the south-east.

AB Based on the view of ecological pattern being steady state, rather than an equilibrium phenomenon, we assert that, if real, ecological biomes and provinces in the ocean should be detectable in surface fields obtained from satellite data as coherent, co-varying spatial regions with a high degree of permanence. Likewise, hierarchy is an important property of ecological systems that should be exhibited by Such patterns if they represent real ecological structure. In this paper, we apply a combination of multivariate statistics and classification techniques to a time series of satellite-derived, surface-ocean chlorophyll data from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), (a) to provide an objective characterisation and classification of ecological pattern in the ocean and (b) to investigate the characteristic system Properties (persistence, hierarchy) of the broad-scale patterns observed to test whether they behave as autonomous ecological systems. Comparison of this classification with Longhurst [Longhurst, A. (1998), Ecological Geography of the Sea. San Diego: Academic Press, 398 pp.] suggests the need for equatorial forcing processes to be taken into account to explain observed ecological pattern at the biome level. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB We have developed a model linking phytoplankton absorption to phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) that uses a single variable, the optical absorption by phytoplankton at 443 nm, a(ph)(443), which can be derived from the inversion of ocean colour data. The model is based on the observation that the absolute value of aph(443) co-varies with the spectral slope of phytoplankton absorption in the range of 443-510 nm, which is also a characteristic of phytoplankton size classes. The model when used for analysis of SeaWiFS global data, showed that picoplankton dominated similar to 79.1% of surface waters, nanoplankton similar to 18.5% and microplankton the remainder (2.3%). The N. and S. Atlantic and the N. and S. Pacific Oceans showed seasonal cycles with both micro and nanoplankton increasing in spring and summer in each hemisphere, while picoplankton, dominant in the oligotrophic gyres, decreased in the summer. The PSCs derived from SeaWiFS data were verified by comparing contemporary 8-day composites with PSCs derived from in situ pigment data from quasiconcurrent Atlantic Meridional Transect cruises.

AB Regression models relating variables derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) to above-ground and below-ground biomass were estimated for 1395 sample plots in young and mature coniferous forest located in ten different areas within the boreal forest zone of Norway. The sample plots were measured as part of large-scale operational forest inventories. Four different ALS instruments were used and point density varied from 0.7 to 1.2 m(-2). One variable related to canopy height and one related to canopy density were used as independent variables in the regressions. The statistical effects of area and age class were assessed by including dummy variables in the models. Tree species composition was treated as continuous variables. The proportion of explained variability was 88% for above- and 85% for below-ground biomass models. For given combinations of ALS-derived variables, the differences between the areas were up to 32% for above-ground biomass and 38% for below-ground biomass. The proportion of spruce had a significant impact on both the estimated models. The proportion of broadleaves had a significant effect on above-ground biomass only, while the effect of age class was significant only in the below-ground biomass model. Because of local effects on the biomass-ALS data relationships, it is indicated by this study that sample plots distributed over the entire area would be needed when using ALS for regional or national biomass monitoring.

AB Sixteen sea surface temperature (SST) iniages obtained over the coastal ocean of Portugal during the period September 1992-September 2003 were used aiming to identify automatically the areas covered by upwelling waters. Suitable high resolution colour scales were applied to the SST images in order to enhance the thermal patterns and easily identify the waters with a coastal upwelling origin. The automatic identification of the areas covered by upwelling waters was developed by the authors in a previous work, through the application of fuzzy clustering and validation indexes, and here is explored as an oceanographic application to the Portuguese coastal upwelling. The fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm showed to be able to find partitions that closely defined the upwelling areas and the visualization of the fuzzy c-partitions was achieved through the application of a colour scale. The Xie-Beni validation index was used to select the c-partition that best represented the stage of the upwelling event and showed an agreement with the oceanographic interpretation in 10 of the 14 SST segmented images used in this work. Two SST images without upwelling were also used in order to check the response of the algorithm to the absence of the phenomena. The computation of the matching rate between a c-partition and the two areas split by the hand-contoured upwelling boundary also allowed the evaluation of how closely the obtained segmentation reproduced the shape of the areas covered by upwelling waters. This method successfully identified the upwelling boundary regions in 10 of the 14 SST images. The values obtained for the matching rate were higher than 0.77, thus indicating the good quality of the fuzzy partitions. The segmented images with 3 or 4 clusters were the most suitable ones to reproduce the areas covered by upwelling waters, but it was also shown that, for some cases, the upwelling areas could be reasonably well reproduced by the FCM 2-partition images. While in the latter, the area covered with upwelling waters was coincident with the first cluster, in the former, the segmented image showed two clusters within the upwelling area: the first cluster coincided with the area occupied by the most recently upwelled waters near the coast, while the second cluster was coincident with the area occupied by the "older" upwelling waters with its extensions offshore, the so-called cold filaments. The FCM algorithm revealed to be a promising technique in the automatic identification of upwelling areas on SST images. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The portion of the radiance exiting the ocean and transmitted to the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in a particular direction depends on the angular distribution of the exiting radiance, not just the radiance exiting in the direction of interest. The diffuse transmittance t relates the water component of the TOA radiance to that exiting the water in the same direction. As such t is a property of the ocean-atmosphere system and not just the atmosphere. Its computation requires not only the properties of the atmosphere but the angular distribution of the exiting radiance as well. The latter is not known until a determination of the water properties can be made (which is the point of measuring the radiance in the first place). Because of this, it has been customary to assume an angular distribution (uniform upward radiance beneath the water surface) in the computation of t, which is referred to as t*. However, it is known that replacing t with t* can result in an error of several percent in the retrieved water-leaving radiance. Since the error depends on sun-viewing direction, this error could be particularly important when water-leaving radiance from two or more sensors in different orbits are compared. Even given an estimate of the angular distribution of the water-leaving radiance, computation of t using full radiative transfer theory in an image processing environment is not practical. Thus, we developed a first-order correction to t for bidirectional effects in the water-leaving radiance that captures much of the variability of t with viewing direction. The correction computed across a SeaWiFS scan line shows that a t*-induced error of as much as 5-6% could occur near the edges of the scan; however, limiting the scan to polar viewing angles (0) < 60 degrees reduces the error to similar to 1%. Direct application to SeaWTFS and MODIS (AQUA) suggests that the bidirectionally-induced error in the diffuse transmittance will result in an error less than about 1% in the comparison of their normalized water-leaving radiances, as long as theta is less than about 60 degrees. We conclude that, given this constraint, the nonnalized water-leaving retrievals from these two sensors at a given location can be merged without regard for the bidirectionally-induced error in the diffuse transmittance, as the resulting uncertainty is well below that from other sources. It is important to note that this result is likely to apply to any other polar-orbiting sensor with equatorial crossing times (similar to SeaWiFS and MODIS) between 1030 and 1330 h (local time).

AB Within Australia, the discrimination and mapping of forest communities has traditionally been undertaken at the stand scale using stereo aerial photography. Focusing on mixed species forests in central south-east Queensland, this Paper outlines an approach for the generation of tree species maps at the tree crown/cluster level using 1 m spatial resolution Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI; 445.8 nm-837.7 nm wavelength) and the use of these to generate stand-level assessments of community composition. Following automated delineation of tree crowns/crown clusters, spectral reflectance from pixels representing maxima or mean-lit averages of channel reflectance or band ratios were extracted for a range of species including Acacia, Angophora, Callitris and Eucalyptus. Based on stepwise discriminant analysis, classification accuracies of dominant species were greatest (87% and 76% for training and testing datasets; n=398) when the mean-lit spectra associated with a ratio of the reflectance (rho) at 742 nm (rho(742)) and 714 nm (rho(714)) were used. The integration of 2.6 in HyMap (446.1 nm-2477.8 nm) spectra increased the accuracy of classification for some species, largely because of the inclusion of shortwave infrared wavebands. Similar increases in accuracy were achieved when classifications of field spectra resampled to CASI and HyMap wavebands were compared. The discriminant functions were applied subsequently to classify crowns within each image and produce maps of tree species distributions which were equivalent or better than those generated through aerial photograph interpretation. The research provides a new approach to tree species mapping, although some a priori knowledge of the occurrence of broad species groups is required. The tree maps have application to biodiversity assessment in Australian forests. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Understanding a disturbance regime such as gap dynamics requires that we study its spatial and temporal characteristics. However, it is still difficult to observe and measure canopy gaps extensively in both space and time using field measurements or bi-dimensional remote sensing images, particularly in open and patchy boreal forests. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using small footprint lidar to map boreal canopy gaps of sizes ranging from a few square meters to several hectares. Two co-registered canopy height models (CHMs) of optimal resolution were created from lidar datasets acquired respectively in 1998 and 2003. Canopy gaps were automatically delineated using an object-based technique with an accuracy of 96%. Further, combinatorics was applied on the two CHMs and the delineated gaps to provide information on the area of old and new gaps, gap expansions, new random gap openings, gap closure due to lateral growth of adjacent vegetation or due to vertical growth of regeneration. The results obtained establish lidar as an excellent tool for rapidly acquiring detailed and spatially extensive short-term dynamics of canopy gaps. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An evaluation of the use of airborne lidar for multi-temporal forest height growth assessment in a temperate mature red pine (Pinus resillosa Ait.) plantation over a five-year period is presented. The objective was to evaluate the level of uncertainty in lidar-based growth estimates through time so that the optimal repeat interval necessary for statistically meaningful growth measurements could be evaluated. Four airborne lidar datasets displaying similar survey configuration parameters were collected between 2000 and 2005. Coincident with the 2002 and 2005 acquisitions, field mensuration for 126 trees within 19 plots was carried out. Field measurements of stem height were compared to both coincident plot-level laser pulse return (LPR) height percentile metrics and stand level raster canopy height models (CHM).
   The average plot-level field heights were found to be 23.8 in (standard deviation (sigma) = 0.4 in) for 2002 and 25.0 in (sigma = 0.6 in) for 2005, with an approximate annual growth rate of 0.4 m/yr (sigma=0.5 in). The standard deviation uncertainty for field height growth estimates over the three year period was 4 1 % at the plot-level (it = 19) and 92% at the individual tree level (it = 126). Of the lidar height percentile metrics tested, the 90th (L90), 95th (L95) and maximum (Lmax) LPR distribution heights demonstrated the highest overall correlations with field-measured tree height. While all lidar-based methods, including raster CHM comparison, tended to underestimate the field estimate of growth, Lmax provided the most robust overall direct estimate (0.32 m/yr, sigma=0.37 in). A single factor analysis of variance demonstrated that there was no statistically significant difference between all plot-level field and Lmax mean growth rate estimates (P=0.38) and, further, that there was no difference in Lmax growth rate estimates across the examined time intervals (P=0.59). A power function relationship between time interval and the standard deviation of error in growth estimate demonstrated that over a one-year period, the growth uncertainty was in the range of 0.3 in (similar to 100% of total growth) reducing to less than 0.1 in (similar to 6% of total growth) after 5 years. Assuming a 10% uncertainty is acceptable for operational or research-based conifer plantation growth estimates, this can be achieved at a three-year time interval. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB A hybrid inversion technique based on Bayesian network is proposed for estimating the biochemical and biophysical parameters of land surface vegetation from remotely sensed data. A Bayesian network is a unified knowledge-inferring process that can incorporate information derived from multiple sources including remote sensing and information derived from a priori knowledge. Using this inversion approach, content of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b (Cab) and leaf area index (LAI) of winter wheat were estimated from data derived from simulations as well as field measurements. Estimations from the simulated data proved accurate, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.54 m(2)/m(2) in LAI and 4.5 mu g/cm(2) in Cab. In validating the estimates against field measurements, it was found that prior knowledge of target parameters improved the accuracy of estimates, in terms of RMSEs from 0.73 to 0.22 m(2)/m(2) in LAI and 9.6 to 4.0 mu g/cm(2) in Cab. Bayesian inference in this hybrid inversion scheme produces a posterior probability distribution, which can reveal such properties of the inferred results as updated information contained in the inversion result. Using entropy, the revision of posterior information about the parameters of interest was calculated. Including more data may allow more information to be retrieved about parameters in general. Exceptions were also observed where data from some viewing angles slightly reduced the information on the parameters of interest. It was also found that data from these viewing angles were less sensitive to the parameters. The method proposed here was also validated using LandSat ETM+ imagery provided by the BigFoot project. When used for mapping LAI with ETM+ imagery, the proposed method with an RMSE of 0.70 and a correlation of 0.67 produced a slightly better result than that from empirical regression.

AB To estimate the area affected by stubble burning in southern Australia, use was made of observations from the MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on the Terra and Aqua satellites. The burnt area (BA) was calculated from the number of active fires, known as fire hot spots (FHS) using parameters estimated from a survey of firms in the agricultural area of south-westem Australia. The study also served as a ground validation of the capability and limitations of the MODIS sensor and associated algorithm for detection of small agricultural fires.
   During the period from I March to 23 May 2005, 3240 unique FHS associated with stubble burning were detected. The majority of these FHS occurred in the afternoon in the last 3 weeks of April. To estimate the total area of stubble burning associated with these FHS, a survey was sent to 2066 farmers. This survey determined for each farm, the number of fields in which stubble was burnt, average size of field burnt (A), crop types burnt, dates and time of day of burning. Responses were received from 273 firms, 38% of whom reported over 500 stubble bums. The 3240 FHS were intersected with the polygons of the farm boundaries to determine the proportion (P) of stubble bums detected using MODIS. Only 13% (+/- 3%) of the stubble bums recorded in the farm survey were detected. Average field size burnt was 75 ha ( 6 ha). Total BA was calculated as: BA=A * 3240/P, which gave an estimated area of 1.87 million ha. This area was 27% of the total cropped area in south-westem Australia. This level of stubble burning was similar to that determined by a 1990s survey in the State of Victoria.
   Neither cloud cover nor field size was significantly correlated with the low number of stubble fires that were detected. Therefore it was concluded that many stubble bums went undetected because of the lack of coincidence between the time of the MODIS overpass and when stubble bums were initiated. Also the use of additional sensors such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA satellites with afternoon overpasses would improve the fraction of stubble bums detected.
   Across the whole of Australia where winter cropping occurs, there was a high correlation (r(2) = 0.96) between FHS and total cropped area in each State. This provided the basis for extrapolating the field results from south-western Australia, to estimate the total area of stubble burning in southern Australia for 2005. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Merging time series of satellite derived aerosol products from independent missions can support aerosol science by combining in a consistent way temporally overlapping data sets and by increasing data coverage. A merging technique applied to satellite aerosol optical depth tau(a) is presented and tested with SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua data. The technique relies on least squares fitting of the available tau(a) spectra onto a linear or second-order polynomial relation between log-transformed T. and wavelengths. First, the sensor specific products are compared with field observations collected by a sun-photometer installed on the Acqua Alta Oceanographic Tower in the northern Adriatic Sea. Mean absolute percentage differences are approximately 21% at 412 and 443 nm, and increase with wavelength, with large overestimates in the red and near-infrared bands. The mean absolute differences are typically 0.04. When inter-compared, the 2 satellite products agree well, with mean absolute percentage differences lower than 20% at all wavelengths and little bias. The results of the comparison of the merger outputs with the field data are well in line with the validation results of the sensor specific products, and are comparable for the various merging procedures. The benefits of merging in terms of data coverage are briefly illustrated for the Mediterranean basin. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Estimation of the extent and spread of wildland fires is an important application of high spatial resolution multispectral images. This work addresses a fuzzy segmentation algorithm to map fire extent, active fire front, hot burn scar, and smoke regions based on a statistical model, The fuzzy results are useful data sources for integrated fire behavior and propagation models built using Dynamic Data Driven Applications Systems (DDDAS) concepts that use data assimilation techniques which require error estimates or probabilities for the data parameters. The Hidden Markov Random Field (HMRF) model has been used widely in image segmentation, but it is assumed that each pixel has a particular class label belonging to a prescribed finite set. The inixed pixel problem can be addressed by modeling the fuzzy inernbership process as a continuous Multivariate Gaussian Markov Random Field. Techniques for estimating the class membership and model parameters are discussed. Experimental results obtained by applying this technique to two Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) images show that the proposed methodology is robust with regard to noise and variation in fire characteristics as well as background. The segmentation results of our algorithm are compared with the results of a K-means algorithm, an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (which is very similar to the Fuzzy C-Means Clustering algorithm with entropy regularization), and an MRE-MAP algorithm. Our fuzzy algorithm achieves more consistent segmentation results than the comparison algorithms for these test images with the added advantage of simultaneously providing a proportion or error map needed for the data assimilation problem.

AB Mapping tools are needed to document the location and extent of Phragmites australis, a tall grass that invades coastal marshes throughout North America, displacing native plant species and degrading wetland habitat. Mapping Phragmites is particularly challenging in the freshwater Great Lakes coastal wetlands due to dynamic lake levels and vegetation diversity. We tested the applicability of Hyperion hyperspectral satellite imagery for mapping Phragmites in wetlands of the west coast of Green Bay in Wisconsin, U.S.A. A reference spectrum created using Hyperion data from several pure Phragmites stands within the image was used with a Spectral Correlation Mapper (SCM) algorithm to create a raster map with values ranging from 0 to 1, where 0 represented the greatest similarity between the reference spectrum and the image spectrum and I the least similarity. The final two-class thematic classification predicted monodominant Phragmites covering 3.4% of the study area. Most of this was concentrated in long linear features parallel to the Green Bay shoreline, particularly in areas that had been under water only six years earlier when lake levels were 66 cm higher. An error matrix using spring 2005 field validation points (n = 129) showed good overall accuracy - 81.4%. The small size and linear arrangement of Phragmites stands was less than optimal relative to the sensor resolution, and Hyperion's 30 in resolution captured few if any pure pixels. Contemporary Phragmites maps prepared with Hyperion imagery would provide wetland managers with a tool that they currently lack, which could aid attempts to stem the spread of this invasive species.

AB Work on water stress detection at tree and orchard levels using a high-spatial airborne thermal sensor is presented, showing its connection with yield and some fruit quality indicators in olive and peach commercial orchards under different irrigation regimes. Two airborne campaigns were conducted with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) over olive and peach orchards located in Cordoba, southern Spain. The AHS sensor was flown at three different times on 25 July 2004 and 16 July 2005, collecting 2 in spatial resolution imagery in 80 spectral bands in the 0.43-12.5 mu m spectral range. Thermal bands were assessed for the retrieval of land surface temperature using the split-window algorithm and TES (Temperature-Emissivity-Separation) method, separating pure crowns from shadows and sunlit soil pixels using the reflectance bands. Stem water potential and stomatal conductance were measured on selected trees at the time of airborne flights over the orchards. Tree fruit yield and quality parameters such as oil, weight and water content (for the olive trees), and fruit volume and weight (for the peach trees) were obtained at harvest and through laboratory analysis. Relationships between airborne-estimated crown temperature minus air temperature and stem water potential yielded r(2) = 0.5 (12:30 GMT) at the olive tree level, and r(2) = 0.81 (9:00 GMT) at the treatment level in peach trees. These results demonstrate that water stress can be detected at the crown level even under the usual water management conditions of commercial orchards. Regressions of yield and fruit quality against remote sensing estimates of crown temperature as an indicator of water stress, yielded r(2) = 0.95 (olive fruit water content) and r(2) = 0.94 (peach fruit mean diameter). These results suggest that high-spatial remote sensing thermal imagery has potential as an indicator of some fruit quality parameters for crop field segmentation and irrigation management purposes. A simulation study using ASTER spectral bands and aggregated pixels for stress detection as a function of irrigation level was conducted in order to study the applicability of medium resolution thermal sensors for the global monitoring of open-canopy tree crops. The determination coefficients obtained between the ASTER-simulated canopy temperature minus air temperature and stem water potential yielded r(2)=0.58 (12:30 GMT) for olive trees, suggesting the potential for extrapolating these methods to ASTER satellite for global monitoring of open tree canopies.

AB Variability and trends in lake ice dynamics (i.e. lake ice phenology) are related to climate conditions. Climate influences the timing of lake ice melt and freeze onset, ice duration, and lake thermal dynamics that feedback to the climate system initiating further change. Phenology records acquired in a consistent manner and over long time periods are required to better understand variability and change in climate conditions and how changes impact lake processes. In this study, we present a new technique for extracting lake ice phenology events from historical satellite records acquired by the series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors. The technique was used to extend existing in-situ measurements for 36 Canadian lakes and to develop records for 6 lakes in Canada's far north. Comparison of phenology events obtained from the AVHRR record and in-situ measurements show strong agreement (20 lakes, 180 cases) suggesting, with high confidence especially in the case of break-up dates, the use of these data as a complement to ground observations. Trend analysis performed using the combined in-situ and AVHRR record similar to 1950-2004 shows earlier break-up (average - 0.18 days/year) and later freeze-up (average 0.12 days/year) for the majority of lakes analyzed. Less confidence is given to freeze-up date results due to lower sun elevation during this period making extraction more difficult. Trends for the 20 year record in the far north showed earlier break-up (average 0.99 days/year) and later freeze-up (average 0.76 days/year). The established lake ice phenology database from the historical AVHRR image archive for the period from 1985 to 2004 will to a certain degree fill data gaps in the Canadian in-situ observation network. Furthermore, the presented extraction procedure is not sensor specific and will enable continual data update using all available satellite data provided from sensors such as NOAA/AVHRR, MetOp/AVHRR, MODIS, MERIS and SPOT/VGT.

AB Surface temperature anomalies associated with geothermal activity at Bradys Hot Springs, Churchill County, Nevada were mapped using Advanced Spacebome Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared (TIR) image data. In order to highlight subsurface contributions of geothermal heat, the ASTER images were processed to minimize temperature variations caused by the diurnal heating effects of the sun. Surface temperature variations caused by changes in albedo were corrected with visible and near-infrared ASTER bands, and a 10-meter-smoothed Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to correct for topographic slope effects. Field measurements of ground surface temperatures made over 24-hour periods were used to design a thermal inertia correction incorporating day and night thermal infrared images.
   In the resulting processed image, background temperature variations were reduced 30-50% without reducing the intensity of geothermal anomalies, thus making it easier to distinguish geothermal activity from 'false' anomalies caused by non-thermal springs, topographic effects, and variable rock, soil, and vegetation compositions.

AB Using QuikScat-based vector wind data for 1999-2003, surface wind stress and turbulent heat (Q) have been mapped for the tropical Indian Ocean (10) to understand their seasonal variability. During July wind stress is enhanced by similar to 70% in the Arabian Sea compared to that during January. The Arabian Sea experiences a large Q loss (150-200 W/m(2)) during the summer and winter monsoons, which is nearly 1.3 times of that in the Bay of Bengal. The southeasterlies are strengthened during the southern hemisphere winter. Empirical Orthogonal Function analysis captures different phases of monsoon-induced variability in wind stress and Q, ranging from seasonal to high-frequency perturbations. Coherency between time coefficients of EOF-1 for wind stress and Q suggests that former leads the latter with a temporal lag of 20-40 days for period > 322 days. At high frequencies (< 21 days) Q leads wind stress with a temporal lag of 2 days. Possible explanation for wind stress leading Q over an annual time scale is offered based on the marine atmospheric boundary layer physics and pre-conditioned ocean surface, while on shorter time scales (21 days) ocean thermodynamics through mixed layer processes cause Q to lead wind stress.

AB To determine the degree of comparability between three spectrometers (Analytical Spectral Devices FieldSpec Pro FR (FR), Analytical Spectral Devices HandHeld (HH), and UniSpec Spectral Analysis System (UN)), leaf spectra of three species (Cafea arabica, Lantana camara, Eriobotrya japonica), recorded from each instrument, were compared using two illumination, viewing, and field of view (FOV) scenarios. Scenario 1 eliminated differences due to illumination, viewing, and FOV conditions. Scenario 2 represented a 'typical' illumination and viewing set-up for each instrument. Six vegetation indices were computed from the raw spectra as well as spectra (1) interpolated to 1-nm intervals (the sampling interval of the FR) and (2) interpolated to 3.3 nm (the sampling interval of the UN). The spectra measured from the three instruments differed in both shape and amplitude, more so for scenario 2 than scenario 1. In many cases, indices obtained using one instrument differed significantly from the same indices obtained using the other two instruments (but the same leaves), regardless of scenario. The severity of these differences varied between indices. Interpolation was generally ineffective in 'matching' the spectra from the various instruments. Care should be exercised when comparing indices generated from spectra measured from different instruments. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In a balanced experiment based on 20 field plots located in a 21 km(2) Scots pine forest in southeast Norway covering age classes from newly regenerated to old forest, leaf area index (LAI) was determined in field by a LAI-2000 instrument and hemispheric photography. Based on a fortualized framework, i.e., the so-called Beer-Lambert law, gap fraction derived from small-footprint airborne laser scanner data was regressed against field-measured LAI. LAI was strongly (R-2 =0.87-0.93), positively, and linearly related to the log-transformed inverse of the gap fraction derived from the laser scanner data. This was as expected according to the Beer-Lambert law, as was the absence of an intercept, producing a directly proportionality of the two variables. We estimated an extinction coefficient for the first return echoes to be 0.7, fortunately fairly stable across age classes, and this is likely to be a parameter specific for the applied laser scanner system under the given flight and system settings, such as flying altitude and laser pulse repetition frequency. It was demonstrated that airborne laser was able to detect defoliation in terms of estimated changes in LAI, by three repeated laser data acquisitions over the area where severe insect attacks were going on in between the acquisitions.

AB Both moderate and high spatial resolution imagery can be used to quantify abundance and distribution of urban vegetation for urban landscape management and to provide inputs to physical process models. Estimation of vegetation fraction from Landsat ETM+ and Quickbird allows for operational monitoring and reconnaissance at moderate resolution with calibration and vicarious validation at higher resolution. Establishing a linear correspondence between ETM-derived vegetation fraction and Quickbird-derived vegetation fraction facilitates the validation task by extending the spatial scale from 30 x 30 m to a more manageable 2.8 x 2.8 in. A comparative analysis indicates that urban reflectance can be accurately represented with a three component linear mixture model for both Landsat ETM+ and Quickbird imagery in the New York metro area. The strong linearity of the Substrate Vegetation Dark surface (SVD) mixture model provides consistent estimates of illuminated vegetation fraction that can be used to constrain physical process models that require biophysical inputs related to vegetation abundance. When Quickbird-derived 2.8 m estimates of vegetation fraction are integrated to 30 in scales and coregistered to Landsat-derived 30 in estimates, median estimates agree with the integrated fractions to within 5% for fractions > 0.2. The resulting Quickbird-ETM+ scatter distribution cannot be explained with estimate error alone but is consistent with a 3% to 6% estimation error combined with a 17 m subpixel registration ambiguity. The 3D endmember fraction space obtained from ETM+ imagery forms a ternary distribution of reflectance properties corresponding to distinct biophysical surface types. The SVD model is a reflectance analog to Ridd's V-I-S land cover model but acknowledges the fact that permeable and impermeable surfaces cannot generally be distinguished on the basis of broadband reflectance alone. We therefore propose that vegetation fraction be used as a proxy for permeable surface distribution to avoid the common erroneous assumption that all nonvegetated surfaces along the gray axis are completely impermeable. Comparison of mean vegetation fractions to street tree counts in New York City shows a consistent relationship between minimum fraction and tree count. However, moderate and high resolution areal estimates of vegetation fraction provide complementary information because they image all illuminated vegetation, including that not counted by the in situ street tree inventory.

AB Accurate measurement and characterisation of fluctuations in the irradiance environment is important for many areas of optical remote sensing. This paper describes a method of estimating spectral irradiance over the region 400-1000 nm from the radiance of a calibrated reference panel, measured in four narrow spectral bands (FWHM approx. 10 nm). The reproducibility of the method was found to have an average root-mean-squared error of approximately 30 mW m(-2) nm(-1) over the region 400-1000 nm when applied to spectra covering a range of clear-sky conditions typical of mid-latitude temperate regions. This was approximately twice as precise as the sequential method, even when the interval between target and reference panel measurements was very short (median interval 23 s). The method provides an alternative to linear interpolation between successive reference panel measurements and is particularly appropriate for conditions when irradiance is varying in a non-systematic way, for example, during the passage of sub-visual clouds.

AB The potential of canopy reflectance modelling to retrieve simultaneously several structural variables in managed Norway spruce stands was investigated using the "Invertible Forest Reflectance Model", INFORM. INFORM is an innovative extension of the FLIM model, with crown transparency, infinite crown reflectance and understory reflectance simulated using physically based sub-models (SAILH, LIBERTY and PROSPECT). The INFORM model was inverted with hyperspectral airborne HyMap data using a neural network approach. INFORM based estimates of forest structural variables were produced using site-specific ranges of stand structural variables. A relatively simple three layer feed-forward backpropagation neural network with two input neurons, one neuron in the hidden layer and three output neurons was employed to map leaf area index (LAI), crown coverage and stem density.
   To identify the optimum 2-band spectral subset to be used in the inversion process, all 2-band combinations of the HyMap dataset were systematically evaluated for model inversion. Field measurements of structural variables from 39 forest stands were used to validate the maps produced from HyMap imagery. Using two HyMap wavebands at 837 nm and 1148 nm the obtained accuracy of the LAI map amounts to an rinse of 0.58 (relative rinse = 18% of mean, R-2 = 0.73). With HyMap data resampled to Landsat TM spectral bands and using two "optimum" bands at 840 nm and 1650 nm, rinse was 0.66 and relative rinse 21%. In contrast to approaches based on empirical relations between spectral vegetation indices and structural variables, the main advantage of the inversion approach is that it does not require previous calibration.

AB Global land use and land cover products in highly dynamic tropical ecosystems lack the detail needed for natural resource management and monitoring at the national and provincial level. The MODIS sensor provides improved opportunities to combine multispectral and multitemporal data for land use and land cover mapping. In this paper we compare the MODIS Global Land Cover Classification Product with recent land use and land cover maps at the national level over a characteristic location of Miombo woodlands in the province of Zambezia, Mozambique. The performances of three land cover-mapping approaches were assessed: single-date Supervised classification, principal component analysis of bandpair difference images, and multitemporal NDVI analysis. Extensive recent field data were used for the definition of the test sites and accuracy assessment. Encouraging results were achieved with the three approaches. The classification results were refined with the help of a digital elevation model. The most consistent results were achieved using principal component analysis of band-pair difference images. This method provided the most accurate classifications for agriculture, wetlands, grasslands, thicket and open forest. The overall classification accuracy reached 90%. The multitemporal NDVI provided a more accurate classification for the dense forest cover class. The selection of the right image dates proved to be critical for all the cases evaluated. The flexibility of these alternatives makes them promising options for rapid and inexpensive land cover mapping it) regions of high environmental variability such as tropical developing countries.

AB We compared a set of methods for estimating fractional green vegetation cover (f(c)) over a similar to 4000 km(2) region of central New Mexico, USA. The models used were trained and tested independently using high-resolution, true-color orthoimagery with 0.3 in spatial resolution. Simple NDVI-based methods performed well for estimating f(c) regionally but overestimated f(c) in sparsely vegetated areas with bright soils, and areas with abundant non-photosynthetic vegetation (e.g. dry shrubs). Three-, four-, and five-endmember spectral mixture models (SMA3, SMA4, and SMA5) were also compared. Constrained versions of these models all produced similar accuracy regionally, but constrained and unconstrained versions of the SMA5 model best captured f(c) for the rarer landscapes (bright soils, riparian vegetation) found throughout the region. This indicates that heterogeneous landscapes can be stratified into relatively homogeneous strata, and three or four endmembers may be adequate to characterize the spectral variability within each stratum. Including NDVI along with the six reflective bands of ETM+ data, provided enough data dimensionality to support the five-endmember SMA model. This permitted a more complete representation of the range of spectral landscape types that are germane for separating out green vegetation in this semi-arid region. We also note that green woody vegetation and green grass cover should be spectrally represented by two different endmembers in SMA because these two vegetation types are spectrally different, particularly in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength.

AB The characterisation of the geostrophic surface flow field around the Cape Verde Archipelago in the northeast Atlantic Ocean with satellite altimeter data is presented. The aim is to analyse the main current systems present in the region 3 degrees-30 degrees N, 40 degrees-10 degrees W and their seasonal and interannual variability. A merged data set of Topex/Poseidon (T/P) and ERS-2 altimeter data for an 8-year period, beginning in June 1995, has been used and corrected sea surface heights were computed by applying a homogeneous set of relevant geophysical corrections. ERS-2 data were crossover adjusted to T/P. Monthly maps of sea level anomalies were created for the whole period and were used in the computation of monthly maps of absolute dynamic topography, geostrophic currents and eddy kinetic energy (EKE). The seasonal signal of the northeast Tropical Atlantic large-scale surface circulation appears as the prevailing cause of the variability in the region, particularly in the southernmost portion of the region being studied. This signal is also present in the flow field along the African coast and in the Guinea Dome. Regions of highest EKE values are clearly associated with the North Equatorial Counter-Current and with the currents along the African coast. The significant interannual variability found for 1998 seems to be associated with the 1997-1998 ENSO Pacific event, but other anomalous periods (1996-1997 and 2001-2002) uncorrelated with ENSO are also evident.

AB Two thousand five hundred thirty-nine kilometers of airborne laser profiling and videography data were acquired over the state of Delaware during the summer of 2000. The laser ranging measurements and video from approximately one-half of that data set (1304 km) were analyzed to identify and locate forested sites that might potentially support populations of Delmarva fox squirrel (DFS, Sciurus niger cinereus). The DFS is an endangered species previously endemic to tall, dense, mature forests with open understories on the Eastern Shore of the Chesapeake Bay. The airborne LiDAR employed in this study can measure forest canopy height and canopy closure, but cannot measure or infer understory canopy conditions. This airborne LiDAR profiler, then, must be viewed as a tool that identifies and locates potential, not actual, habitat. Fifty-three potentially suitable DFS sites were identified in the 1304 km of flight transect data. Each of the 53 sites met the following criteria according to the LiDAR and video record: (1) at least 120 in of contiguous forest;, (2) an average canopy height > 20 m; (3) an average canopy closure of > 80%; and (4) no roofs, impervious surface (e.g., asphalt, concrete), and/or open water anywhere along the 120 m length of the laser segment. Thirty-two of the 53 sites were visited on the ground and measurements taken for a DFS habitat suitability model. Seventy-eight percent of the sites (25 of 32) were judged by the model to be suited to supporting a DFS population. All of the LiDAR flight data, 2539 km, were analyzed to estimate county and statewide forest area in different height/canopy closure classes. Approximately 3.3% of Delaware (17,137 ha) supports forest over 20 in tall with crown closures exceeding 80%; the corresponding county percentages are Newcastle County-6.1% (6823 ha), Kent County-2.2% (3431 ha), and Sussex County-2.7% (6883 ha). Estimates of average within-patch crossing distance and average between-patch distances are reported, by county, and for the state. Study results indicate that: 1) systematic airborne LiDAR data can be used to screen extensive areas to locate potential DFS habitat; 2) 78% of sites meeting certain minimum length, height, and canopy closure criteria will support DFS populations, according to a habitat suitability model; 3) airborne LiDAR can be used to calculate county and state acreage estimates of potential habitat, and 4) the linear transect data can be used to calculate patch statistics. The authors suggest that the systematic county and state flight lines can be revisited at intervals to monitor changes to the areal extent of potential habitat over time. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper deals with ERS wind scatterometer (WSC) data for land surface monitoring over the Sahel on a regional scale. Past studies have shown that WSC is particularly well suited for monitoring Sahelian pastoral regions consisting of large homogeneous herbaceous steppes (Jarlan et al., 2002a,b). On the other hand, Sahelian agro-pastoral areas are more heterogeneous in terms of WSC spatial cell resolution owing to different land use caused by anthropic pressure. The objective of this paper is to assess the suitability of WSC data in such a heterogeneous landscape. To this end, WSC data for an agro-pastoral area are compared with results presented in Jarlan et al., 2002b, which focused on 4 pastoral sites, located in Mali. The agro-pastoral area concerned is in the Fakara region (Niger), for which numerous in situ measurements are available for the 1994-2000 period over a 500 kin 2 area. WSC temporal signatures acquired at a 45 degrees incidence angle, sigma(0)(45 degrees), show the typical behaviour observed over the Sahelian areas. sigma(0)(45 degrees) values are higher than those observed by Jarlan et al. (2002b) over Northern Sahelian sites, especially during the dry season, and exhibit a lower yearly amplitude variability. The effect of land use heterogeneity on the radar signal is investigated by comparing WSC profiles acquired at a 21 degrees incidence angle, sigma(0)(21 degrees), with ERS SAR data during the year 1995. The observations are interpreted by combining a radiative transfer model and a vegetation growth model in a similar approach to the one developed by Frison et al., 1998 and Jarlan et al., 2002a, 2002b, 2003. The results indicate that at an incidence angle of 21 degrees, soil contribution is largely predominant, representing 90% of the radar signal, thus explaining the similar behaviour of radar signatures observed despite different land uses. At a 45 degrees incidence angle, even though annual vegetation and bare soil are the two main factors influencing the temporal evolution of the radar signal, the bare soil contribution is still the most significant. It is shown that over the present study site, characterised by low annual vegetation fraction cover and high sigma(0)(45 degrees) values during the dry season, vegetation makes no significant contribution to the yearly amplitude of the radar signal, sigma(0)(adr)(45 degrees). The latter can be explained by the bare soil contribution alone. Consequently, limited soil moisture due to small field capacity accounts for the small sigma(0)(adr)(45 degrees) variability observed. An inversion method to retrieve the volumetric soil moisture content, H-v, using sigma(0)(45 degrees) data is then developed. It appears that vegetation has a negligible influence over estimated Hv. As a result, the soil moisture content can be retrieved from WSC data alone, by representing the present scene as being composed of bare soil only. These results differ from those obtained over pastoral Sahelian sites, where both vegetation and soil moisture play significant roles in radar response. Moreover, the comparison between WSC sigma(0)(45 degrees) retrieved soil moisture with existing soil moisture derived from passive microwave radiometer SSM/I measurements shows a fairly good overall match.

AB We present results of an analysis of deforestation at a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, the Parque National Yasuni, located in the rainforests of eastern Ecuador using multitemporal Landsat TM and ETM+ satellite imagery. Using survival analysis, we assessed both cut-rent and future trends in deforestation rates, and investigated the impact of spatial, cultural, and economic factors oil deforestation. These factors included the distance from roads, rivers, research facilities, oil facilities, markets and towns. and land ownership by colonists, native inhabitants, and an oil company. We found the annual rate of deforestation is currently only 0.11%, but that this rate is increasing with time and, assuming that the trend of increasing rate of forest loss continues, we would predict that by 2063, 50% of the forest within 2 kill of an oil access road will be lost to unhindered colonization and anthropogenic conversion. The Quechua colonists are associated with areas of the highest rate of deforestation, followed by the native Huaorani and the lowest region of deforestation was in areas Occupied by a local oil company. By far, the strongest predictor of where deforestation is predicted to occur was proximity to the road. Proximity to research sites, oil facilities, market, and rivers significantly decreases deforestation rates, and proximity to towns significantly increases deforestation rates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) is an invasive plant species in the north central and western U.S. and southern Canada. Idaho has established populations in the north and southeastern regions which are spreading into new sites. This study demonstrates the ability of high resolution hyperspectral imagery to provide high quality data and consistent methods to locate small and low percent canopy cover occurrences of leafy spurge. Locating leafy spurge in its early stages of invasion is critical for land managers in order to prioritize treatment, conservation, and restoration activities. Hyperspectral data were collected in 2002 and 2003 for the study area in southeastern Idaho. The imagery was classified with the Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF) algorithm. Although classifications from single date images provided discrimination of leafy spurge at approximately 10% cover in one 3.5 m pixel, for repeatability and consistency purposes, the threshold for leafy spurge discrimination is approximately 40% cover. We hypothesize that georegistration errors, small differences in leafy spurge reflectance, training endmember selection, and image processing and field validation biases between years influence multi-date detection limits. Although hyperspectral imagery is costly, in some situations, the advantages of having reliable and repeatable mapping abilities for discrimination of economically damaging invasive species such as leafy spurge outweigh the image and processing costs.

AB In biological modelling of the coastal phytoplankton dynamics, the light attenuation coefficient is often expressed as a function of the concentrations of chlorophyll and mineral suspended particulate matter (SPM). In order to estimate the relationship between these parameters over the continental shelf of the northern Bay of Biscay, a set of in situ data has been gathered for the period 1998-2003 when SeaWiFS imagery is available. These data comprise surface measurements of the concentrations of total SPM, chlorophyll, and irradiance profiles from which is derived the attenuation coefficient of the photosynthetically available radiation, K-PAR. The performance of the IFREMER look-up table used to retrieve the chlorophyll concentration from the SeaWiFS radiance is evaluated on this new set of data. The quality of the estimated chlorophyll concentration is assessed from a comparison of the variograms of the in situ and satellite-derived chlorophyll concentrations. Once the chlorophyll concentration is determined, the non living SPM, which is defined as the SPM not related to the dead or alive endogenous phytoplankton, is estimated from the radiance at 555 nm by inverting a semi-analytic model. This method provides realistic estimations of concentrations of chlorophyll and SPM over the continental shelf all over the year. Finally, a relationship, based on non living SPM and chlorophyll, is proposed to estimate K-PAR on the continental shelf of the Bay of Biscay. The same formula is applied to non living SPM and chlorophyll concentrations, observed in situ or derived from SeaWiFS radiance. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The performance of several criteria to generate multitemporal composites of daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) images for burned land mapping was tested using data acquired over the Iberian Peninsula in 2001, 2003 and 2004. The experiment was based on four tests that assessed the discriminability between burned and unburned areas, the presence of artifacts (clouds and clouds shadows), the verticality of the sensor viewing angle, and the spatial coherency of the composite images. Seven different compositing techniques were tested, based on maximizing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and brightness/surface temperature, and minimizing reflectance and sensor zenith angles. The composite criterions that provide the most accurate images for burned land mapping were based on maximizing brightness/surface temperatures, either as the only criterion or in conjunction with minimizing sensor zenith angle or near infrared (NIR) reflectance. These composites present high discrimination capacity between burned and unburned areas, remove most clouds and cloud shadows, offer high spatial coherency and present middle-to-low sensor zenith angles. Traditional compositing criterion based on maximizing NDVI values provided poor results in most tests. Finally, standard NASA MODIS composite provides close to nadir observation angles, and good spatial coherency, but it offered lower discrimination between burned and unburned areas that those composites based on thermal data.

AB This study investigates the use of single-band reflectance at visible wavelengths for the derivation of suspended sediment concentrations in the Irish Sea. A reasonably strong relationship was observed between irradiance reflectance at 665 rim (R-665) and mineral suspended sediment (MSS) concentrations. Variability in the Reflectance-MSS relationship was found to be the consequence of changes in the mass-specific scattering coefficient (b(MSS)(*)) brought about by differences in particle properties such as grain size and composition. A systematic increase in the slope of the Reflectance-MSS relationship was observed with increasing b(MSS)(*). A reflectance model is presented that highlights the dependence of reflectance on b(MSS)(*) and suggests that the errors in predicted MSS concentrations can be reduced from 56% to as little as 12% with prior knowledge of the scattering properties of the sediments under study. This paper highlights the need for a complete understanding of the scattering properties of particles in order to accurately estimate MSS concentrations from reflectance measurements. It is suggested that in order to obtain quantitative estimates of MSS in moderately turbid waters from space, it may be necessary to pre-determine scattering efficiencies, b(MSS)(*), for the area of interest.

AB Arid lands are distinctive ecological zones that require vegetation maps for management and monitoring. The use of remote sensing for mapping desert vegetation is made difficult by the mixing of reflectance spectra of bright desert soils with the relatively weak spectral response of sparse vegetation. To investigate ways to improve desert vegetation mapping, a comparison of the effect of supervised classification using two contrasting measures of field vegetation data as reference data was performed. We took cover- and density-based field vegetation data that had been collected by the US Army on the US Yuma Proving Ground (USYPG) in southwest Arizona, converted them into cover- and density-based reference classification schemes and used them to train both maximum likelihood (ML) and artificial neural net (ANN) classifiers. The impact on the accuracy of cover- and density-based vegetation maps were further analyzed using different combinations of input data (i.e., Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery, ERS-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, and elevation data). In spite of the fact that a cover-based plot classification is the logical training data for remote sensing classification, both cover- and density-based classified maps had similar accuracies for each data combination. The use of all data combinations gave the highest map classification accuracies, with the radar data improving the accuracy the most where the vegetation is dense. Classification accuracies of maps using the ML classifier were generally higher than those using the ANN classifier. ANN map classification accuracies improved significantly when the sigmoid transfer function was replaced with the hyperbolic tangent transfer function. Using the two contrasting measures for mapping proved complementary: the coverbased map located areas of significant tree presence that were not mapped on the density-based map and the density-based map located areas of significant cacti presence that were not mapped on the cover-based map. Creating both cover- and density-based vegetation maps may therefore better assist and land management than creating only a cover-based vegetation map. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Field mapping of young lava flows at Aleutian volcanoes is logistically difficult, and the utility of optical images from aircraft or satellites for this purpose is greatly reduced by persistent cloud cover. These factors have hampered earlier estimates of the areas and volumes of three young lava flows at Westdahl Volcano, including its most recent (1991-1992) flow. We combined information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images with multispectral Landsat-7 data to differentiate the 1991 - 1992 flow from the 1964 flow and a pre- 1964 flow, and to calculate the flow areas (8.4, 9.2, and 7.3 km(2), respectively). By differencing a digital elevation model (DEM) from the 1970-1980s with a DEM from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) in February 2000, we estimated the average thickness of the 1991-1992 flow to be 13 in, which reasonably agrees with field observations (5-10 m). Lava-flow maps produced in this way can be used to facilitate field mapping and flow-hazards assessment, and to study magma-supply dynamics and thus to anticipate future eruptive activity. Based on the recurrence interval of recent eruptions and the results of this study, the next eruption at Westdahl may occur before the end of this decade. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sub-pixel mapping and sub-pixel sharpening are techniques for increasing the spatial resolution of sub-pixel image classifications. The proposed method makes use of wavelets and artificial neural networks. Wavelet multiresolution analysis facilitates the link between different resolution levels. In this work a higher resolution image is constructed after estimation of the detail wavelet coefficients with neural networks. Detail wavelet coefficients are used to synthesize the high-resolution approximation. The applied technique allows for both sub-pixel sharpening and sub-pixel mapping. An algorithm was developed on artificial imagery and tested on artificial as well as real synthetic imagery. The proposed method resulted in images with higher spatial resolution showing more spatial detail than the source imagery. Evaluation of the algorithm was performed both visually and quantitatively using established classification accuracy indices. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The seasonal transition of the boreal forest between frozen and non-frozen conditions affects a number of ecosystem processes that cycle between winter dormant and summer active states. The relatively short K-u-band wavelength (2.14 cm) of the space-borne NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) is sensitive to changes in dielectric properties, associated with large-scale changes in the relative abundance and phase (frozen or thawed) of canopy and surface water. We used a temporal change detection analysis of NSCAT daily radar backscatter measurements to characterize the 1997 seasonal spring thaw transition period across the 10(6) km(2) BOREAS study region of central Canada. In the spring, air temperature transitions from frozen to non-frozen conditions and surface observations of seasonal snow cover depletion were generally coincident with decreases in radar backscatter of more than 2.9 dB, regardless of regional landcover characteristics. We used a temporal classification of NSCAT daily differences from 5-day smoothed backscatter values to derive three simple indices describing the initiation, primary event and completion of the spring thaw transition period. Several factors had a negative impact on the relative accuracy of NSCAT-based results, including periodic gaps in NSCAT daily time-series information and a large (i.e., >2 cm day(-1)) spring rainfall event. However, these results were generally successful in capturing the seasonal transition of the region from frozen to non-frozen conditions, based on comparisons with regional weather station network information. These results illustrate the potential for improved assessment of springtime phenology and associated ecosystem dynamics across high latitude regions, where field based and optical remote-sensing methods are substantially degraded by frequent cloud cover, low solar illumination and sparse surface weather station networks.

AB Hydrographic data collected in the upper 50 m off La Jolla, CA, USA (31degreesN, 117degreesW) between 1970 and 1972 were reanalyzed to examine temporal variability in the local temperature-nitrate relationship and to document how chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton community structure covary with the temperature-nitrate relationship. Based on the linear expression y=mx+b, they-intercepts (b), slopes (m), and x-intercepts ( - b/m or nitrate depletion temperature, NDT) of four seasonal (January-March, April-June, July-September, and October-December) temperature-nitrate relationships, obtained from the combined multiyear data set, were statistically different from each other and varied around overall multiyear values of b = 72.73 muM, m = - 5.33 muM degreesC(-1), and NDT = 13.65degreesC. Three interannual temperature-nitrate relationships from February to April 1970, 197 1, and 1972 also had y-intercepts, slopes, and x-intercepts that were statistically different from each other. Nevertheless, limited variability in direct comparisons among seasonal or interannual regression lines and a 1 degreesC La Jolla NDT range compared to a 25 degreesC global NDT range supported the general utility of NDT-based comparisons. A nitrate-normalized temperature axis (T - NDT) was created for the La Jolla data set by subtracting NDT from the recorded water column temperatures (T). Chlorophyll a reached a maximum between 0 and 2 degreesC on this T-NDT axis that ranged from - 4 to 10 degreesC. Microscope-based determinations of La Jolla centric diatom, permate diatom and dinoflagellate abundances, and La Jolla chlorophyll a, partitioned in proportion to the numerical abundance of the three groups, both peaked in logical progression along the T-NDT axis. In a separate analysis of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data from three Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) cruises (50degreesN to 52degreesS), chlorophyll a peaked below 0 degreesC and three different phytoplankton classes, nanoflagellates, large eukaryotes and prokaryotes, distributed in logical progression along a sea surface temperature (SST) minus NDT axis. To further generalize these results, a previously reported 1degrees latitude x 1degrees longitude grid of NDTs for the world ocean was applied to satellite-derived grids of SST for March 1999 through June 2000. The SST - NDT calculation provided a standard nitrate-normalized axis simultaneously applicable to all locations in the world ocean. Sixteen plots of satellite-derived chlorophyll a versus SST - NDT for March 1999 through June 2000 demonstrated the opposing seasonal movements of northern and southern hemisphere chlorophyll a along the SST-NDT axis. Based on the phytoplankton community patterns along the temperature minus NDT in the La Jolla and AMT data sets, this chlorophyll a movement along the SST-NDT axis can be associated with phytoplankton community changes related to location around SST - NDT = 0 degreesC. The SST - NDT index appears to provide a useful tool for interpreting the character of the phytoplankton community structure contributing to satellite-derived chlorophyll a in the world ocean.

AB During the period 1973-1999, the effects of air pollution on the terrestrial ecosystems in the border areas of Norway and Russia have been investigated by the use of satellite remote sensing. Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) and Thematic Mapper (TM) data, in combination with field work data collected in the period 1970-2000, were applied to produce land cover maps for seven different years, with an overall accuracy of 75-83%. On the basis of this monitoring, we can conclude that the main effect of air pollution was that the areas of lichen (Cladina spp.)-dominated forests and mountain heaths were reduced from 37% in 1973 to 10% in 1994, followed by a slight increase to 12% in 1999. The lichen-dominated vegetation types were changed into barrens, partly damaged vegetation entities, and dwarf shrub (e.g., Vaccinium myrtillus)-dominated vegetation. We found a significant negative relationship (r=-0.94, p=0.001) between the extent of the area of mixed forests with lichen content and the emissions Of SO2 during the period. The area of the category industrial barrens had a significant negative relationship (r= -0.95, p = 0.001) to the emissions Of SO2 during the same period. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Fluorescence spectral characteristics associated with growth under different irradiance levels, and during rapidly changing lighting conditions, were measured on healthy bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants using a laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (LIFS) system. The LIFS system was designed as a prototype of a handheld field remote sensing system and used a tripled Nd:YAG laser to produce ultraviolet (UV) excitation photons at 355 nm. Dark-adapted canopies of the bean and wheat plants grown under 150, 300, or 450 mumol m(-2) s(-1) of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) exhibited LIFS spectra with higher relative fluorescence intensities than emissions from light-adapted plants at all three light levels. Blue/red and blue/far-red leaf fluorescence ratios for both bean and wheat plants increased dramatically as PAR increased, but red/far-red ratios decreased as PAR increased. Light-adapted plants grown under the three light levels were then subjected to several rapidly changing lighting conditions. Plants were exposed sequentially to 150, 300, and 650 mumol m(-2) s(-1) PAR from metal halide lamps, followed by a fourth light treatment of 650 mumol m(-2) s(-1) PAR from a mixture of metal halide and tungsten-halogen lamps. The tungsten-halogen lamps added significant amounts of near-infrared (NIR) irradiation to the background light environment provided by the metal halide lamps. Results indicated that both bean and wheat canopies generally exhibited stable blue, green, red, and far-red fluorescence emissions when plants were exposed to 150, 300, and 650 mumol m(-2) s(-1) PAR from the metal halide lamps. In contrast, when bean and wheat plants were exposed to the NIR-enriched light supplied by the tungsten-halogen lamps, blue and green fluorescence remained stable, but red and far-red fluorescence increased dramatically immediately after exposure to the NIR photons. However, the increased levels of red and far-red fluorescence observed after exposure to NIR light decreased quickly (within 55 s) and returned to "baseline" levels observed at the start of the rapidly changing light experiments. Results indicate that handheld LIFS instruments can be used for remote sensing of plant canopies under a diversity of lighting conditions including full darkness, dawn and dusk lighting environments, and under rapidly changing light environments similar to those encountered on partly cloudy days.

AB Evaluation of an Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) image of the Mountain Pass, California area indicates that several important litbologic groups can be mapped in areas with good exposure by using spectral-matching techniques. The three visible and six near-infrared bands, which have 15-m and 30-m resolution, respectively, were calibrated by using in situ measurements of spectral reflectance. Calcitic rocks were distinguished from dolomitic rocks by using matched-filter processing in which image spectra were used as references for selected spectral categories. Skarn deposits and associated bright coarse marble were mapped in contact metamorphic zones related to intrusion of Mesozoic and Tertiary granodioritic rocks. Fe-muscovite, which is common in these intrusive rocks, was distinguished from Al-muscovite present in granitic gneisses and Mesozoic granite.
   Quartzose rocks were readily discriminated, and carbonate rocks were mapped as a single broad unit through analysis of the 90-m resolution, five-band surface emissivity data, which is produced as a standard product at the EROS Data Center. Three additional classes resulting from spectral-angle mapper processing ranged from (1) a broad granitic rock class (2) to predominately granodioritic rocks and (3) a more mafic class consisting mainly of mafic gneiss, amphibolite and variable mixtures of carbonate rocks and silicate rocks.

ID HIERARCHICAL SCENE MODELS; IMAGES; VARIOGRAMS
AB The development of appropriate ground-based validation techniques is critical to assessing uncertainties associated with satellite data-based products. In this paper, the second of a two-part series, we present a method for validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Leaf Area Index (MODIS LAI) product with emphasis on the sampling strategy for field data collection. Using a hierarchical scene model, we divided 30-m resolution LAI and NDVI images from Maun (Botswana), Harvard Forest (USA) and Ruokulahti Forest (Finland) into individual scale images of classes, region and pixel. Isolating the effects associated with different landscape scales through decomposition of semivariograms not only shows the relative contribution of different characteristic scales to the overall variation, but also displays the spatial structure of the different scales within a scene. We find that (1) patterns of variance at the class, region and pixel scale at these sites are different with respect to the dominance in order of the three levels of landscape organization within a scene; (2) the spatial structure of LAI shows similarity across the three sites, that is, ranges of semivariograms from scale of pixel, region and class are less than 1000 in. Knowledge gained from these analyses aids in formulation of sampling strategies for validation of biophysical products derived from moderate resolution sensors such as MODIS. For a homogeneous (within class) site, where the scales of class and region account for most of the spatial variation, a sampling strategy should focus more on using accurate land cover maps and selection of regions. However, for a heterogeneous (within class) site, accurate point measurements and GPS readings are needed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We examine methodologies for estimation of vegetation cover, leaf area index (LAI), and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (f(APAR)), considering the spectral sampling and dual-view capability of the ATSR-2 sensor. A set of Simulated ATSR-2 reflectance measurements and corresponding vegetation parameters is defined using a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model. The case of semiarid vegetation is considered allowing for varying fractional cover, structure, and presence of standing litter, The error in estimation of vegetation properties using vegetation indices, linear spectral unmixing, and model inversion is compared over this dataset, quantified by a measure of signal to noise (S/N). For the estimation of f(APAR), the NDVI gave best S/N among vegetation indices (S/N 4.5). Linear mixture modelling based on library spectra showed considerable improvement over vegetation indices for estimation of total vegetation cover. LAI is not retrieved with much accuracy by any method in the presence of standing litter and variable fractional cover, Model inversion has potential to be the most accurate method for retrieving all parameters, but only if the model approximates reality within 15%. Overall, the S/N in estimating parameters by any method is considerably lower than the S/N in instrument calibration (20/1). Use of the dual-view showed potential to improve estimates, but requires accurate registration. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Atmospheric correction for airborne sensors: Comment on a scheme used

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID IMAGERY; ALGORITHM
AB In a recent work by Gould and Arnone [Remote Sens. Environ. 61 (1997) 290] the compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI) was used to map the absorption and scattering properties of a coastal environment. The methodology used in this work is also cited in a number of more recent studies. The authors found large discrepancies between the parameters estimated from measurements (AC9) and from a biooptical model by Carder et al. [J. Geophys. Res. 104 (1999) 5403]. As a result, they adjusted the backscattering efficiency parameter of the model. We found, however. that the discrepancies may actually be due. at least in part, to an erroneous atmospheric correction used for the airborne data. Because the removal of the surface-reflected sky radiance was neglected, the estimated water-leaving radiance was erroneously augmented and used as the input of the bio-optical model. This caused a scattering overestimate and an absorption underestimate. It is suggested that the surface reflection, unlike for land applications, should always be removed to obtain the water signal for use with such biooptical models. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB In this study, information on variograms is integrated with image interpretation of standwise volume of tree stock by using a nonparametric method based on a distance-weighted mean of most similar neighbors (MSN). The usability of the various indicator attributes, including image pixel characteristics and features derived from a variogram curve, in the interpretation is studied by analyzing the accuracy of the results at the compartment level. The accuracy of the volume estimation at the stand level was improved when the empirical variogram values were included in the set of indicator attributes in the MSN analysis. With this kind of MSN analysis, the chosen k nearest neighbors have a similar spatial variation structure in the image material as in the target stand. It was found that increasing the number of similar neighbors beyond 3 did not improve the accuracy. When the variogram information was included in the indicator attribute set, the root mean square error (RMSE) of volume estimate was at its lowest at 18% and the bias was then - 0.6%. When the variogram information was not used, the RMSE was at its lowest at 24-27% and the bias was 0.2-1.8%, depending on the number of indicator variables used. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB This paper aims to clarify the potential of the new Landsat 7/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors for change detection in coral reef environments. We processed images of two reef sites in Florida and Hawaii acquired over short time intervals (2 weeks and 3 months). During these periods, reefs were not affected by major disturbances (phase shift, strategy shift, bleaching, and hurricanes). This stability allowed us to assess the bias in change detection analysis. Two methods for change detection analysis were applied. The first one estimates the atmospheric conditions (Rayleigh and aerosol radiances, ozone and diffuse transmittances) using an ETM+/SeaWiFS multisensor approach. The second method is an empirical correction based on pseudoinvariant features that compensates for different atmospheric conditions as well as for any sensor (noise) or environmental (water column, sea surface state) conditions. The atmospheric correction alone did not provide an accurate match in images across time due to significant whitecaps and possible sun glint and its products required an empirical adjustment. Therefore, for the images in this study there was not substantial benefit in performing an atmospheric correction compared to an empirical correction alone. Both methods resulted in a minimum uncertainty of 4, 3, and 3 digital counts, respectively, in ETM+ Bands 1-3. Finally, we completed the study of real images by the analysis of ETM+ reflectance spectra for a large variety of coral reef objects. We concluded that the assessment of the rates of change in three ubiquitous classes 'sand,' 'background' (including rubble, pavement, and heavily grazed dead coral structure), and 'foreground' (including living corals and macroalgae) emerges as the most reproducible and feasible application for the ETM+ sensor.

AB Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data from Landsat-7 are providing glaciologists with an ever-expanding data set that makes a comprehensive monitoring of the global cryosphere feasible for the first time in history. Examples of ETM+ data illustrate its ability to satisfy major scientific needs in the glaciological subdisciplines of sea-ice, glacier, ice-cap, and ice-sheet research with high-resolution optical satellite imagery. Examples shown include use as proxy ground-truth, positioning glacier termini and snowlines, and determining snow facies boundaries. The additional ETM+ panchromatic band, at a higher spatial resolution of 15 m, improves the spatial accuracy of these applications. The glaciological aspects of the Landsat-7 Long-Term Acquisition Plan are discussed to show how the timing and location of the image acquisitions will generate a cryospheric data set of unprecedented utility for future research.

AB The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) is an Earth-observing sensor, which provides global retrievals of aerosols, clouds, and land surface parameters. Instrument specifications require an accurate absolute calibration, as well as accurate camera-to-camera, band-to-band and pixel-to-pixel relative response determinations. In order to achieve these requirements, MISR makes use of an on-board calibrator (OBC), as well as vicarious calibration (VC) experiments. The OBC makes use of two Spectralon diffuse panels in order to provide a flatfield illumination. Bi-monthly deployments of these panels into the camera fields-of-view will be made. At these times, solar-reflected radiance values are measured by photodiode detector standards. Accurate relative bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data are required to transfer these photodiode-measured radiances into camera-incident values. An independent calibration pathway, known as VC, will also be implemented in order to reduce systematic errors and to provide a crosscheck on the OBC findings. Here, the top-of-atmosphere radiances are computed from in situ observations of surface reflectance and atmospheric transmittances, Key to these measurements is knowledge of the hemispheric/directional reflectance factor (HDRF) of the field reflectance standards. This report describes the BRF measurements of the MISR flight panels, and provides an estimation as to the differences between HDRF and BRF for the MISR view angles. This BRF data base is available from the MISR web site, http://www-misr.jpl.nasa.gov. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

ID VEGETATION
AB Sequences of satellite images are increasingly being used to monitor our environment. An important step in the development of methods for detecting, measuring, and monitoring change through time is the ability to compare images from different dates and sites in different scenes. These comparisons require the digital counts from each scene to be calibrated to common reference values. A method of relative calibration using robust regression and large numbers of likely invariant targets has been developed and implemented operationally. One or more images are calibrated to the digital numbers of a common reference scene. The technique has been used to calibrate over 100 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes of the Western Australian wheatbelt. The method and its application are described. The repeatability of the calibrations over a sequence of images of the same scene from different dates is examined. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Estimation of timber volume at the sample plot level by means of image
   segmentation and Landsat TM imagery
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB The use of image segments in the feature extraction for the estimation of timber volumes using a Landsat TM image was investigated by applying the k nearest neighbour estimation method (knn) and Finnish National Forest Inventory (NFI) sample plots. The estimates of the volumes by tree species at the plot level were derived by means of the cross-validation technique. Ten nearest neighbours (NNs) were applied in the estimation. Image segments were derived by two different methods: (1) a measurement space-guided clustering followed by the connected component labeling (ISOCCL) and (2) a directed trees algorithm (NG). The segmentations were fine-tuned by means of two different region-merging algorithms. The spectral features were extracted in two ways: from a fixed window (FW) around the field sample plot, and from those pixels within the FW that belonged to the same segment as the: sample plot pixel. Window sizes from 1 to 11 x 11 pixels were tested, and the average of the extracted pixel values was used in the estimation. Features from the ISOCCL-based segments gave the best estimates for the volumes of pine and spruce, as well as for the total volume. Best estimates for the volume of broad-leaved trees were obtained from NG-based segments. Compared to the estimates of the FW approach, the improvements were, however, quite small and relative root mean square errors (RMSEs) remained high. The minimum and maximum improvements of relative RMSEs were 1% and 11.3%. respectively. The NG was considered a more applicable segmentation method for forest inventory purposes at the stand level, even though the ISOCCL gave slightly better estimation results in this study. The use of image segmentation in the stratification of the image material into stand margin and within stand areas could be more suitable for the estimation of forest variables. This is the case especially if only the plot-level field information is available. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Zn an effort to further develop the methods needed to remotely sense the biochemical concentration of plant canopies, we report the results of an experiment to estimate the concentration of 12 foliar biochemicals (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, lignin, nitrogen, cellulose, water, phosphorous, protein, amino acids, sugar, starch) from reflectance spectra of dried and ground slash pine needles. The three methodologies employed used stepwise regression and either of the following: (i) standard first derivative reflectance spectra (FDS), (ii) absorption band depths, following continuum removal and normalisation against band depth at the centre of the absorption feature (BNC) or (iii) absorption band depths, following continuum removal and normalisation against the area of the absorption feature (BNA). These latter two methodologies have been proposed in this journal [Remote Sens. Environ., 67 (1999) 267.] on the basis of an experiment using reflectance spectra of dried and ground tree leaves and the concentration of three foliar biochemicals: nitrogen, lignin and cellulose. All three methodologies were implemented on a spectra/biochemical data set from early in the growing season and tested on a similar data set from late in the growing season. The accuracy with which foliar biochemical concentration could be estimated: while high for all methodologies, was highest when using the two proposed by Kokaly and Clark. At an illustrative R-2 threshold of .85 (between estimated and observed biochemical concentration), all three methodologies could be used to estimate total chlorophyll, nitrogen, cellulose and sugar; in addition, the BNC methodology could be used to estimate chlorophyll a and b, and in addition to this, the BNA methodology could be used to estimate lignin and water. Given the advantages offered by the Kokaly and Clark methodologies lover and above the standard methodology) for a wide range of foliar biochemicals, it is recommended that their utility is investigated for the estimation of foliar biochemical concentration from field, airborne and spaceborne spectra.

AB Space-time variability in the global distribution of atmospheric total column water vapor (tcwp) greatly impacts the hydrologic cycle. NASA's Water Vapor Project (NVAP) produced a global 1 degrees x1 degrees tcwp data set for use as a tool to investigate, among other things, atmospheric variability. An independent cross-comparison of the NVAP tcwp product was performed using the TOPEX/POSEIDON (TIP) TOPEX microwave radiometer (TMR) data and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)-based range delay data set produced by Meteo-France (MF) and distributed with T/P data. When these T/P range delay data are converted to tcwp, they show that NVAP is biased dry and ECMWF/MF is biased wet relative to the independent TMR measurement. Although the absolute accuracy of the NVAP tcwp product is uncertain, results indicate its relative accuracy is sufficient for variability studies. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and spectral analysis applied to this data set show that seasonal variability over the annual cycle accounts for about 20% of the variance (EOF1). An El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) signal is found in the annually demeaned data; the magnitude of the crosscorrelation between the temporal amplitude (TA) of EOF1 and the Nino 3.3 (SST) time series is .9. Comparisons also were made between the NVAP patterns of variability in tcwp and independent reanalysis and interpretation of numerical model generated atmospheric fields. In general, there is good agreement between the NVAP data and the reanalysis fields. Finally, specific recommendations are made for: (1) improvement of the NVAP data set upon reanalysis and (2) use of the NVAP data, in place of ECMWF/MF-based range delay data, for T/P retrievals when TMR data are not available if and when T/P data are reanalyzed. This latter recommendation is especially important for regions of the tropical Indo-Pacific (e.g., Indonesia) where islands can interfere with valid TMR retrievals. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Monitoring vegetation using remote sensing is beset with difficulties. Primary among these are the variations of vegetation reflectance with sun zenith angle, view zenith angle. and terrain slope angle. To provide corrections of these effects, for visible and near-infrared light, we derive two simple physicial models of vegetation reflectance, both of which have three parameters. The first model., WAK I. is applicable when illumination is by direct light only, and the second model, WAK II, is applicable when illumination is by both diffuse and direct light. The models were tested by fitting them to reflectance data of Virginia pine, irrigated wheat. and alfalfa. at large sun zenith angles, and then comparing predictions of reflectance at small sun zenith angles with measurements. The process was then reversed to do the fitting on the small sun zenith measurements and the prediction of the large sun zenith measurements. Using this method of assessment, the WAK models were found to perform better than several other published models. The WAK models were used to derive a formula for the variation of reflectance with terrain slope angle, which was tested by measuring reflectances of microcanopies set up on different slopes in the laboratory. The formula permits topographic correction of vegetation reflectance without needing to know the bidirectional reflectance factor. The simplicity and robustness of the WAK models make them useful for general correction and calibration of remotely sensed imagery. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In this work different classification algorithms including contextual classifiers, one of them being original, are applied and compared on sites belonging to landscape units ranging from tiny fields surrounded by hedges to larger and more open fields. Confusion matrices and result analysis are presented at two observation scales: at the catchment area level and at the landscape unit level. We show how the choice of a classification technique can significantly influence the results of crop inventories and how the accuracy of classification algorithms vary according to the landscape units of the studied area. From these results a strategy can be developed Sor a better choice of classification algorithms regarding the considered landscape structure. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.,All Rights Reserved.

AB The characteristic behavior of red-near-infrared (NIR) reflectance-based vegetation isolines were analyzed by focusing on its three features: the slope, NIR-intercept, and the intersection between the vegetation isoline and the soil line. These properties are the key factors in understanding variations of vegetation index values with changes of canopy background brightness, known as background noise. The analysis was conducted based on a vegetation isoline equation derived by using the representation of canopy reflectance by the adding method. The isoline parameters, slopes, and NIR-intercepts of vegetation isolines were numerically obtained by the SAIL canopy model. Some of the known behaviors of the vegetation isoline were simulated and analyzed in detail. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB With the launch of new spaceborne sensors capable of acquiring bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data of the earth surface, extensive ground BRDF measurements will become necessary to provide much-needed ground reference data from numerous remote sensing applications. To obtain homologous BRDF data from field goniometer devices, guidelines and recommendations are required that will allow a better comparison between BRDF data from different goniometer systems, from air- and spaceborne sensors, as well as form theoretical studies with physically based BRDF models. In this study, tow examples of recent goniometer systems are given, and the quality and limits of field goniometer systems are discussed, along with detailed practical advice for the acquisition, processing, and documentation of BRDF data and ancillary information. Special emphasis is on the characterization and documentation of atmospheric and measurement surface conditions. The study also presents common shortcomings and limitations of field BRDF data, such as the influence of diffuse irradiance and changes in illumination conditions, and gives recommendations for correcting these effects from an application-oriented viewpoint.

AB Cloud top height is an important variable for both scientific and operational meteorological applications. Unfortunately, direct observations of cloud top height are generally not routinely made. This article develops a new hybrid method for estimating cloud top height from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data to help provide more abundant and accurate cloud top height estimates at low cost. It takes into account arbitrary viewing and illumination conditions which can affect the accuracy of both cloud shadow detection and cloud shadow-based cloud top height retrievals. Results were validated with data taken by NASA's ER-2 Cloud LIDAR System (CLS). The mean differences between the AVHRR-based cloud height estimates and the LIDAR observations for the two validation images analyzed are 0.45 km and 0.67 km. The sensitivity of the results to the parametrizations used by the new algorithm was also evaluated. Parameters can be chosen to minimize their effect on retrieved cloud top heights; the procedure executes quickly. Given the accuracy of the cloud top height retrievals, the method could be used routinely to provide cloud top heights for a wide variety of meteorological and hydrometeorological applications (e.g., numerical weather prediction, drought monitoring). With the improved spatial resolution (and reduced cost) of data from soon to be launched new satellite observing systems, proportionally higher accuracy and resolution for cloud top heights can be achieved economically using this method.

AB A recent article by Ottle et al. (1997) has discussed the use of covariance-variance techniques for the determination of atmospheric water vapor content from split-window radiance measurements. We have applied the recommended technique to several sets of data from both AVHRR and ATSR and find no correlation with associated water vapor measurements for oceanic data and for AVHRR data over the land. However, some weak correlation is found with ATSR-2 data over land, but our analysis shows that any such relation is fragile and at the moment, cannot be used operationally.

AB Large areas of sand fields in and and semiarid regions are covered by cyanobacteria soil crusts. The objective of this article is to analyze (systematically throughout the VIS, NIR, and the SWIR regions of the spectrum) the unique spectral features of cyanobacteria crust relative to bare sands mid under different moisture conditions. It was found that: 1) When biogenic soil crusts a-re wet, their NDVI value can reach 0.30 units due to their photosynthetic activity; 2) the chaser the red edge inflection point is to the longer wavelengths, the higher the relative abundance and distribution of the microphytic community; 3) the phycobilin pigments, which are unique to cyanobactria, contribute to higher reflectance in the blue region relative to the sand substrate; 4) a crust index based on this uncommon spectral feature can be useful for detecting and mapping, from remote sensing imagery, different lithologic/morphologic units; 5) although most dune sand areas are generally made of quartz, other notable features appear on their spectra. In the study area, there are absorption features representing minerals (iron oxides at 860 nm and clay minerals at 2200 nm) and biogenic crusts (chlorophyll at 670 nm and organic matter at 1720 nm, 2180 mn, and 2309 nm).

   spectral matching and mixture modeling of SWIR AVIRIS imagery
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID MULTISPECTRAL IMAGES; REFLECTANCE; NEVADA
AB Spectral matching and linear mixture modeling techniques have been applied to synthetic imagery and AVIRIS SWIR imagery of a semiarid rangeland in order to determine their effectiveness as mapping tools, the synergism between the two methods, and their advantages, and limitations for rangeland resource exploitation and management. Spectral matching of pure library spectra was found to be an effective method of locating and identifying endmembers for mixture modeling although some problems were found with the false identification of gypsum. Mixture modeling could accurately estimate proportions for a large number of materials in synthetic imagery; however, it produced high variance estimates and high error estimates when presented with all nine AVIRIS endmembers because of high noise levels in the imagery. The problem of which endmembers to select was addressed by implementing a mixture model that allowed estimation of the errors on the proportions estimates, discarding the endmembers with the highest errors, recomputing the errors, and the proportions estimates, and iterating this process until the mixture maps were relatively free from noise. This methodology ensured that the lowest contrast materials were discarded. The inevitable confusion that followed was monitored the using the maps produced by spectral matching. Spectral matching was more effective than mixture modeling for geological mapping because it allowed identification and mapping of the relatively pure regions of all the surficial materials that exert an influence on the spectral response. The maps of the different clay minerals were of considerable value for mineral exploration purposes. Conversely, spectral matching was less useful than mixture modeling for rangeland vegetation studies because a classification of all pixels is needed and abundance estimates are required for many applications. Mixture modeling allowed identification of both nonphotosynthetic and green vegetation cover and thus total cover. Though the green vegetation mixture map appears to be very precise, the nonphotosynthetic vegetation estimates were poor. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB Analyses of various biophysical and biochemical factors affecting plant canopy reflectance have been carried out over the past few decades, yet the relative importance of these factors has not been adequately addressed. A combination of field and modeling techniques wee used to quantify the relative contribution of leaf, stem, and litter optical properties (incorporating known variation in foliar biochemical properties) and canopy structural attributes to nadir-viewed vegetation reflectance data. Variability in tissue optical properties was wavelength-dependent. For green foliage, the lowest variation was in the visible (VIS) spectral region and the highest in the near-infrared (NIR). For standing litter material, minimum variation occurred in the VIS/NIR, while the largest differences were observed in the shortwave-IR (SWIR). Woody stem material slowed opposite trends, with lowest variation in the SWIR and highest in the NIR. Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle distribution (LAD) were the dominant controls on canopy reflectance data with the exception of soil reflectance and vegetation cover in sparse canopies. Leaf optical properties (and thus foliar chemistry) were expressed most directly at the canopy level in the NIR, but LAI and LAD strongly controlled the relationship between leaf and canopy spectral characteristics. Stem material played a small but significant role in determining canopy reflectance in woody plant canopies, especially those with LAI<5.0. Standing litter significantly affected the reflectance characteristics of grassland canopies; small increases in the percentage of standing litter had a disproportionately large affect on canopy determine the relative contribution of tissue, canopy, and landscape factors that drive variation in a reflectance signal. Deconvolution of these factors requires an understanding of the sources of variance at each scale (which is ecosystem dependent) as well as an adequate sampling (spectral, angular, and temporal) of the shortwave (400-2500 nm) spectrum.

ID ABUNDANCE
AB Spectral mixture modeling was performed for identification and mapping of land degradation features related to soil erosion processes in the Sacaba Valley, Bolivia. The model allowed use of up to five surface components to characterize the selected area, since six bands (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7) of the Landsat TM sensor were used as inputs. Among the various methods commonly used to determine end-members from the satellite image, three were selected: a) identification of one "pure" pixel representing a particular surface component from false color composites; b) average of "pure" pixels to characterize a particular end-member; and c) a method based on principal components. The best characterization of end-members was achieved by using average pure pixel reflectance. The median of the abundance images showed that, in 95% of the cases, the individual pixel compositions were explained by the selected surface components. The research has demonstrated that regional patterns of soil surface erosion features can be reliably mapped using linear spectral mixture analysis. Extrapolation of this approach to other regions where soil degradation features are correlated with spectrally distinguishable surface characteristics is feasible, provided that an optimization of the unmixing model as a function of local or regional surface component types is completed.

ID DIFFUSION-MODELS
AB Forests on the Kola Peninsula in Northern Russia are growing close to the limits of the northern tree line. They are subjected to both natural (low temperatures and a short period of biochemical activity) and anthropogenic stress factors. The metallurgic industry complex Severo-nickel close to the city of Monchegorsk in the central Russian Kola Peninsula is one of the major sources of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nickel, and copper emissions in the region. The environmental impact on the surrounding area is dramatic. In this study multispectral changes observed in landsat-MSS satellite image data from 1978, 1986, and 1992 are used to evaluate the relevance of a mathematical model of SO2 concentration in ambient air as a component for assessment of forest decline. The multispectral changes detected were found to have a statistically significant correspondence to the modeled (SO2) concentration levels in ambient air. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB Little research has focused on the use of imaging spectrometry for change detection. In this paper, we apply Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data to the monitoring of seasonal changes in atmospheric water vapor, liquid water, and surface cover in the vicinity of the Jasper Ridge, CA, for three dates in 1992. Apparent surface reflectance was retrieved and water vapor and liquid water mapped by using a radiative-transfer-based inversion that accounts for spatially variable atmospheres. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) was used to model reflectance data as mixtures of green vegetation (GV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), soil, and shade. Temporal and spatial patterns in endmember fractions and liquid water were compared to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The reflectance retrieval algorithm was tested by using a temporally invariant target. Atmospheric analysis showed a strongly negative linear between water vapor and elevation with significant seasonal variation in water vapor. Comparison of AVIRIS estimates of specific humidity to ground-based measures showed good correspondence for all three dates. Analysis of surface properties showed that GV, NDVI, and liquid water varied in response to green vegetation and were highly correlated. However, whereas the NDVI peaked between 0.7 and 0.85 in forests, liquid water continued to vary by as much as a factor of two. Seasonal patterns included senescence in herbaceous and nonconiferous vegetation, potential leaf growth in coniferous forests, and a general increase in shadows. This resulted in seasonal declines in NDVI, GV, and liquid water for nonforested vegetation and increases in NPV. Nonconiferous forests showed similar declines in liquid water and GV and increases in shade and NPV, but they showed an increase in NDVI. In coniferous forests, liquid water and NDVI increased seasonally, matching an interpretation of continued growth, but GV decreased owing to increased shade. The combination of retrieved surface reflectance, atmospheric modeling, and mapping of liquid water demonstrates the utility of imaging spectrometry for change detection. SMA with the use of reference end-members is an effective method for monitoring surficial changes. Temporal patterns in NDVI that contradict trends of GV and liquid water in nonconiferous forests raise additional questions about the NDVI. Liquid water may be more appropriate for analysis of high-leaf-area, shadowed forests because it overcomes the problem of saturation with NDVI. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB We monitored the impact of water stress, nitrogen stress, and the combination of both on the fractional interception of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) and growth per unit of intercepted radiation in sunflower canopies over a growing season. The efficiency with which intercepted radiation was converted into biomass (epsilon) was reduced by approximately 35% in the nitrogen-limited canopy and approximately 30% in the water-limited canopy. The relative effect of the stress treatments on epsilon was sensitive to assumptions concerning solar geometry. The impact of stress on fPAR depended more on whether the canopy was nitrogen- and/or water-limited. In the second half of the season, nitrogen stress reduced fPAR by approximately 25%, whereas water stress reduced fPAR by about 70%. Reduction in leaf area index, 45% and 85% for the nitrogen-stressed and water-stressed canopies, respectively, appeared to be a major factor in the fPAR reductions. In the water-stressed canopy, wilting also contributed to the reduced fPAR. Neither of the stress treatments affected the strong correlation between fPAR and simple ratio (SR) or the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We used three approaches to calculate fPAR, with two based on a single sun position and one based on the sun position updated at hourly intervals. In general, epsilon was notably higher in the calculations with higher solar elevation angles. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB A geometric-optical reflectance model is presented which estimates the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of forest canopies by modeling EorLr shadowing pattern components (i.e., illuminated crown, illuminated ground shadowed crown, and shadowed ground. The model represents the forest canopy group of discrete tree crowns and uses a deterministic ray tracing procedure to generate a two-dimensional scene of shadow pattern components. It provides the type of shadow fraction information used to calculate the reflectance of forests when it is treated as an area-weighted sum of the shadow component reflectances. The model is designed to test the effect of canopy structure parameters on the bidirectional reflectance of forests and can easily be adapted to accommodate different crown shapes, crown sizes, stem densities, and distributions. The model was used to isolate and quantify the effects of crown shape, canopy cover stem distribution pattern, and canopy gaps on the shadowing pattern and the canopy reflectance, using a set of statistically generated forest scenes and data gathered for a natural tropical lowland forest scene. The illuminated crown component and the illuminated ground component have the greatest impact on the reflectance values in the red and near-infrared region respectively The red BRDF, mainly influenced by the illuminated ground component, proves to be sensitive to canopy cover tree pattern distribution, and canopy gaps. The near-infrared BRDF, affected by the illumination crown component, is sensitive to canopy cover, crown-center height distribution, and crown shape. Th sensitivity of the BRDF to canopy gaps and crown clumping teas investigated in more detail. Reflectance measurements close to the hotspot are found to be insensitive to clumping while retaining sensitivity to crown cover Forward scattering measurements are found to be more sensitive to gap size and frequency. The spatial effects of plantations, logging, or road features on the BRDF is further analyzed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The shadowing theory has been widely used to account for the hot-spot effect for the canopy and soil. However, it is not valid for soils that are composed of the particles and do not have well-defined shadows. The coherent backscattering theory is used in this study to calculate both the magnitude and the angular width of the hot-spot peak for clay and silt soils. The soil hot-spot magnitude is calculated by solving the vector radiative transfer equation. The dense nature of the soil medium is taken into account in the calculations of the hot-spot angular width. The results are also linked with the Hapke hot-spot empirical function. The effects of the wavelength dependence mid of particle size and shape also are examined. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB The spatial information in a single spectral image can be estimated from the spatial autocorrelation, which is a measure of how the local variation compares with the overall variance in a scene. In images of random noise, the local variation tends to be similar to the overall variance. In contrast, scenes in which large features can be discerned have clusters of pixels with similar values, which cause the local variation to be much smaller on average than the overall scene variance. A comparison of the autocorrelation of images formed by the ratios of two spectral bands is an excellent way to determine which combinations provide the best spectral representation of objects greater in size than the spatial resolution of the sensor. This is because an image formed from the ratios of two nonredundant bands will enhance spectral objects and thus tend to have greater spatial autocorrelation than the ratio of two bands that are very similar. Ratios are a particularly effective method of combining images because this operation tends to reduce the effect of illumination differences and to enhance spectral features.
   Feature selection is the process of finding a subset of the original bands that provides an optimal trade-off between probability of error and classification cost (Swain and Davis, 1978). Three feature selection problems are addressed in this paper: (1) narrow band feature selection, which is the selection of a subset of individual bands; (2) broad band feature selection, in which groups of adjacent bands are selected, and (3) nonadjacent multiple band feature selection, in which selection of the groups of bands is not limited to adjacent bands. Spatial autocorrelation is useful in all three feature selection problems. Narrow band feature selection is carried out by ranking the spatial autocorrelation of all possible combination of ratioed bands. Broad band feature selection can be carried out by iteratively grouping adjacent bands that are the most similar. If the grouping is started from the previously identified best bands, it is possible to develop a metric to check that the incorporation of each additional band to the group enhances the spatial autocorrelation of all the groups of bands together. Nonadjacent multiple band feature selection is simply an extension of the broad band case, except any of the original bands can potentially be grouped in any of the features. Tests with stimulated data indicate that the spatial autocorrelation based methods consistently identify the best bands or groups of bands. Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data of easter Washington state are used to illustrate the technique on real data. The results suggest that visible and near-infrared bands provide a large proportion of the spectral and spatial information in that scene. Adjacent bands in many cases provide similar information, but there are important exceptions such as on the red edge of the infra-red plateau. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Multitemporal imagery is needed to monitor agricultural landscapes characterized by high temporal variability. With the use of a database of 10 Landsat Thematic Mapper images dating from 1984 to 1993, the effects of the number and timing of images on area estimates of productive and nonproductive lands are evaluated for agricultural lands in Egypt. Average underestimation of non-productive lands in the Nile Delta ranges from 5% with data sets of nine images to more than 300% with data sets of two images. Average underestimation of reclaimed lands in the Western Desert ranges from 4% with six image data sets to 42% with one-image data sets. Generally, data sets including more high-growth-season imagery result in higher accuracies, although in some cases a mixture of high- and low-growth-season imagery is more accurate. A single peak-growth image dominates results in both regions; data sets including this image are consistently more accurate than those without it. The results indicate the critical significance of using extensive multitemporal data sets to monitor agricultural landscapes. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID SATELLITE DATA; FORESTS; EXTENT; BRAZIL
AB In this paper, the potential use of spaceborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in mapping land-cover types and monitoring deforestation in tropics is studied. Here, the emphasis is placed on several clearing practices and forest regeneration that can be characterized by using the sensitivity of SAR channels to vegetation biomass and canopy structure. A supervised Bayesian classifier designed for SAR signal statistics is employed to separate five classes: primary forest, secondary forest, pasture-crops, quebradao, and disturbed forest. The L- and C-band polarimetric SAR data acquired during the shuttle imaging radar-C (SIR-C)/X-SAR space-shuttle mission in 1994 are used as input data to the classifier The results are verified by field observation and comparison with the Landsat data acquired in August of 1994. The SAR data can delineate these five classes with approximately 72% accuracy. The confusion arises when separating old secondary forests from primary forest and the young ones from pasture-crops. It is shown that Landsat and SAR data carry complementary information about the vegetation structure that, when used in synergism, may increase the classification accuracy over secondary forest regrowth. When the number of land-cover types was reduced to three classes including primary forest, pasture-crops, and regrowth-disturbed forest, the accuracy of classification increased to 87%. A dimensionality analysis of the classifier showed that the accuracy can be further improved to 92% by reducing the feature space to L-band HH and HV channels. Comparison of SIR-C data acquired in April (wet period) and October (dry period) indicates that multitemporal data can be used for monitoring deforestation; however the data acquired during the wet season are not suitable for accurate land-cover classification.

AB The objective of this study is to examine the capability of SIR-C/X-SAR to map seasonal snow covers in alpine regions. We develop two classification trees. The first classifier can map snow and discriminate dry from wet snow, but it requires a digital elevation model (DEM) for radiometric terrain correction and reduction of the effect of local incidence angle. The second classifier can map wet snow without using a DEM. We demonstrate some processing techniques that are necessary to discriminate wet snow front smooth, bare surfaces and to discriminate dry snow from short vegetation. For validation, we compare our results with snow maps of both binary and snow-fraction classifications obtained from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) at about the same time. The SAR is about 77% as accurate as the TM binary classification, but it underestimates snow cover when compared with snow-fraction classification, with the major differences occurring for mixed pixels of snow and trees.

AB Next-generation ocean color sensors will include channels to measure passive chlorophyll fluorescence as well as traditional channels that use radiance ratios to estimate chlorophyll concentration. Because the chlorophyll fluorescence signal is small, these sensors have significantly higher signal to noise ratios in the channels used to measure fluorescence. Small changes in sensor performance, atmospheric transmissivity, and fluorescence efficiency could potentially result in significant changes in the performance of the fluorescence algorithms. We perform a sensitivity analysis on the present MODIS algorithms and derive the minimum chlorophyll concentrations that can be observed for various combinations of sensor performance, atmospheric conditions, and phytoplankton physiology. We show that the present sensor specifications will allow us to observe fluorescence at chlorophyll concentrations as low as 0.5 mg/m3 at the full resolution of the sensor (nominally 1 km(2) at nadir) under optimum viewing conditions. Although band position changes over a +/-4 nm range affect the absolute reading of individual bands by less than 2%, the impact on the total performance of the fluorescence algorithm can be greater than 70%.

AB The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), which is derived from satellite sensor images, is widely used as a measure of vegetation and ecosystem dynamics, change in land use, desertification, and climatic change processes on a regional or global scale. Surprisingly, in semiarid regions, relatively high values of NDVI were measured in landscapes where little, if any, photosynthetic activity of higher plants exists. We tested the hypothesis that the high NDVI values may be caused by the photosynthetic activity of microphytes (lower plants), consisting of mosses, lichens, algae, and cyanobacteria, which cover most of the rock and soil surfaces in semiarid regions. We found that the spectral reflectance curves of lower plants can be similar to those of the higher ones and their derived NDVI values can be as high as 0.30 units. We conclude that, in semiarid environments, the reflectance of lower plant communities may lead to misinterpretation of the vegetation dynamics and overestimation of ecosystem productivity.

ID CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE; VEGETATION
AB The number of spectrally unique signatures needed to reproduce the statistically significant variance observed in multispectral and hyperspectral datasets can be estimated from the eigenvalues of a principal component analysis (PCA) of the data. In this article, we describe a multidimensional visualization method for interactively searching for a feasible set of spectral signatures in the space of the PCA eigenvectors that account for most of the variance. These spectral signatures, referred to as endmembers, are input to a linear mixture model which can be inverted to compute endmember abundances for each data spectrum. The visualization method discussed in this article and referred to as the manual endmember selection method (MESM) is based on Inselberg's (1985) parallel coordinate representation of multidimensional spaces. It is novel in the field of multidimensional visualization in that it includes not only a passive representation of higher-dimensional data but also the capability to interact with and move geometrical objects in more than 3 dimensions. The spectral shape of endmembers selected with the MESM may be influenced by processes such as multiple scatterings by surface materials and other factors such as illumination geometry that affect the signal received by the sensor. These processes and factors may produce significant errors in computed endmember abundances, tf not accounted for in the endmember reflectance (Roberts, 1991). The MESM is one method for obtaining endmembers that account for all factors and processes significantly affecting the spectral data.

AB Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] seedlings were grown with different fertilization treatments in an experiment designed to investigate the effects of foliar biochemistry on needle and canopy reflectance measurements. Potentially confounding effects of the covariance of canopy structure with foliar biochemical concentration were minimized by fertilizing after leaf expansion. Seedlings showed no significant differences in specific leaf area, % needle moisture, biomass, or LAI, but showed significantly different total nitrogen concentrations, and some differences in chlorophyll concentrations. Measurements were made of needle optical properties, and bidirectional reflectance was obtained of needles and of canopies. Canopy reflectance was acquired under sky illumination using two field spectroradiometers. Needle and canopy treatment differences were highly significant in the visible region. Some treatment differences were also found in broad-band regions in the infrared in the canopy reflectances. Narrow-band infrared differences were detected in needle first derivative spectra, and coincided with known protein absorption features. Needle and canopy bidirectional reflectances were similar, but narrow-band features found in the needle infrared spectra were not found in the canopy data. Two possibilities for the failure to detect these narrow features in the canopy data are a confounding effect from variability caused by illumination angle changes and/or the low signal-to-noise characteristics of the field spectroradiometer relative to the laboratory instrument. The suite of optical and structural measurements taken from the same set of trees should provide a useful data set for parameterizing canopy models aiming to predict high spectral resolution reflectance of canopies.

AB Thr canopy-absorbed photosynthstically active radiation APAR(CAN) is the solar energy consumed in the canopy photosynthetic process. Due to the difficulty of acquiring extensive ground-based observations, increasing efforts are being devoted to estimate APAR(CAN) from optical satellite measurements. So far, APAR(CAN) has been obtained from the downwelling PAR at the surface (SFC), PAR(SFC)down arrow, and the fraction of PAR absorbed by a canopy, FPAR. This study proposes a new approach which defines APAR(CAN) as the product of APAR(SFC) and RPAR. APAR(SFC) is the total PAR absorbed by all surface materials including canopy, soil, litter, etc., while RPAR is the ratio of the PAR absorbed by the green canopy only, to APAR(SFC). The advantage of this approach is that APAR(SFC) can be determined more accurately and readily than PAR(SFC)down arrow, while the determination of RPAR is as accurate as that of FPAR with the same difficulties. The whole approach is introduced in two parts. Part I, as presented in this article, deals with the retrieval of APAR(SFC). Using a complex atmospheric radiative transfer model, APAR(SFC) is related to the upwelling PAR reflected at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), PAR(TOA)up arrow. The relationship is independent of cloud parameters and surface conditions, and moderately dependent on ozone amount and aerosol optical properties. A parameterization teas developed to estimate APAR(SFC) from PAR(TOA)up arrow, which is inferred from satellite measurements in the visible bands. Error analyses were made using data from both model simulations and field observations. The parameterization is valid to within 5 W m(-2) compared to the results of detailed radiation model simulations. A preliminary comparison against FIFE ground observations showed a bias error of - 2.7 W m(-2) and a standard error of 21.9 W m(-2) for the instantaneous estimates of APAR(SFC).

AB The estimation of canopy gap fraction [P-o(0)] from red and near-infrared reflectance is investigated. Several approaches are compared, using classical vegetation Indices (VI) and backpropagation neural networks. The parameters of the VI-P-o(0) relationships and the synaptic weights and biases of two-layer neural networks were successfully adjusted on an experimental data set and on data derived from radiative transfer model simulations. Three experimental data sets were acquired over sugar beef canopies. They expressed a large range of canopy architecture and soil background reflectance. Two of them that correspond to similar experimental procedures were merged together and then randomly split into two subsets: one for fitting the parameters of the VI-P-o(0) relationships or to train the neural network, and the other for the evaluation of the predictive performances. The third experiment is used as an additional independent data set to test the robustness of the approaches. The model simulated data set was generated using the SAIL and PROSPECT radiative transfer models, with input parameter values that were chosen to have similar distributions as observed over sugar beet canopies. As for the experimental data set, the model-simulated data set was split into a training (calibration) and a test (validation) data set. Results show that the gap fraction can be accurately estimated from the red and near-infrared reflectance without any external information except maybe the crop type (here sugar beet) and the soil line characteristics required for some of the vegetation indices. The best predictive performances were observed for the SAVI-like vegetation indices (SAVI, TSAVI, MSAVI) and the poorest for the NDVI, PVI, and GEMI having intermediate al though satisfactory results. Neural networks trained on the simulated data set appeared to be the most robust approach. It allows us to implicitly incorporate our knowledge about the physics of the radiative transfer in the interpretation of remote sensing data.

AB Soil moisture and temperature vertical profiles vary quickly during the day and may have a significant influence on the soil microwave emission. The objective of this work is to quantify such an influence and the consequences in soil moisture estimation from microwave radiometric information. The analysis is based on experimental data collected by the ground-based PORTOS radiometer at 1.4, 5.05, and 10.65 GHz and data simulated by a coherent model of microwave emission from layered media [Wilheit model (1978)]. In order to simulate diurnal variations of the brightness temperature (T-B), the Wilheit model is coupled to a mechanistic model of heat and water flows in the soil. The Wilheit model is validated on experimental data and its performances for estimating T-B are compared to those of a simpler approach based on a description of the soil media as a single layer (Fresnel model). When the depth of this single layer (hereafter referred to as the sampling depth) is determined to fit the experimental data, similar accuracy in T-B estimation is found with both the Wilheit and Fresnel models. The soil microwave emission is found to be strongly affected by the diurnal variations of soil moisture and temperature profiles. Consequently, the T-B sensitivity to soil moisture and temperature profiles has an influence. on the estimation, from microwave observations, of the surface soil moisture in a surface layer with a fixed depth (theta(s)): the accuracy of theta(s) retrievals and the optimal sampling depth depends both on the variation in soil moisture and temperature profile shape.

AB A combined spectral, spatial, and geomorphometric variable set was used to separate geomorphic surfaces at three scales, corresponding roughly to process domain (level I), landform (level II), and sublandform (level III). The best results were obtained using the combined data set, demonstrating two concepts: i) With the use of specialized processing techniques, digital variables can separate geomorphic surfaces at a variety of scales, and ii) considerable advantages can be gained by using multisource remote sensing data. Stepwise selection patterns indicated that geomorphometric variables were the most important contributors to discriminant functions at levels I and II. The reduced effectiveness of spectral and spatial measures reflects the highly variable nature of surface cover at the process domain and landform levels. At level III, variable contributions were more balanced, suggesting that high-quality landcover information from spectral and spatial variables are necessary for the consistent separation of sublandform units.

ID DIGITAL IMAGES; AUTO-CORRELATION; REGULARIZATION; CROP
AB It is often useful to estimate obscured or missing remotely sensed data. Traditional interpolation methods, such as nearest-neighbor or bilinear resampling, do not take full advantage of the spatial information in the image. An alternative method, a geostatistical technique known as indicator kriging, is described and demonstrated using a Landsat Thematic Mapper image in southern Chiapas, Mexico. The image was first classified into pasture and nonpasture land cover. For each pixel that was obscured by cloud or cloud shadow, the probability that it was pasture was assigned by the algorithm. An exponential omnidirectional variogram model was used to characterize the spatial continuity of the image for use in the kriging algorithm. Assuming a cutoff probability level of 50%, the error was shown to be 17% with no obvious spatial bias but with some tendency to categorize nonpasture as pasture (overestimation). While this is a promising result, the methods practical application in other missing data problems for remotely sensed images will depend on the amount and spatial pattern of the unobscured pixels and missing pixels and the success of the spatial continuity model used.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE; AMERICAN SOILS; SPECTROSCOPY; IRON
AB Near-infrared analysis (NIRA) methodology was applied to the reflectance spectra of arid and semiarid soils in the visible and near infrared (VIS-NIR; 0.4-1.1 mum) spectral region. The method is termed visible and near-infrared analysis (VNIRA). Although the spectra of the soils were characterized as monotonous and featureless, the methodology has yielded a prediction equation for estimating several soil constituents from the reflectance curves. The constituents were: CaCO3, Fe2O3, Al2O3, SiO2, LOI (lost-on-ignition), Fed (free iron oxides), and K2O. Several mathematic manipulations were applied to the raw data in order to derive the optimal prediction equation. Spectral compression into 6, 8, 15, 71, and 350 spectral bands and a spectral derivation technique were applied to four separate soil groups, which were selected on the basis of their chemical characteristics. The wave-lengths selected by the method for the optimal prediction equation were assigned to constituents that consisted of spectral features within the VIS-NIR region. An intercorrelation between spectrally featureless constituents and constituents with special features was found to be the major mechanism by which to predict constituents that had no spectral features within this part of the spectrum. It was shown that low spectral resolution is not necessarily a limiting factor in obtaining quantitative information about the chemistry of soil samples. All the examined soil constituents except Fed (which needed 700 spectral bands) required between 15 and 350 spectral bands for optimal prediction. It was concluded that the VIS-NIR (0.4-1.1 mum) is a suitable spectral region for obtaining quantitative information about soil chemistry. Although the VNIRA performance is not as precise as the chemical performance, the precision obtained is likely to be useful for rapid soil characterization and remote-sensing applications. We strongly recommend the use of both the VNIRA and the NIRA methods to better interpret high resolution remote-sensing data.

AB The 37 GHz polarization difference observed by the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), which was operated on board the Nimbus-7 satellite, provides a sensitive indicator of surface water. These data ran provide information on seasonal inundation patterns large tropical wetlands such as the Amazon River floodplain. Although the SMMR data are of low resolution, we were able to estimate the area inundated within a group of pixels by using linear mixing models which incorporate the major end-members of the observed microwave signatures. The models were then used to estimate seasonal changes in inundation area over a 7-year period for a 34,550 km2 area along the Amazon River near Manaus. The seasonal changes in inundation area determined using mixing models correlate well with changes in river stage.

AB The utility of satellite data in forest decline assessment is influenced by effects associated with variations in stand characteristics such as species composition, age, and density. In this study, the spectral effects of stand variations were determined for forest dominated by Norway spruce. The usefulness of digitized stand data for potentially reducing these effects were investigated. It is suggested that a damage estimation algorithm based solely on Landsat TM Band 4 is more appropriate than earlier proposed ratio algorithms in areas with moderate defoliation symptoms but no chlorosis. The two factors with the strongest negative effect on the defoliation assessment were varying hardwood and pine component, A hardwood component of 20% completely neutralized a defoliation of 20%. Age had a clear spectral effect up to 70 years, but above that the response was stable. There was no confusion between defoliation classes in stands with moderate to high density. A spruce defoliation model that used stand data from digitized forest maps to modify the intensity values of TM Band 4 prior to estimation of defoliation was developed. The resulting assessment of moderate defoliation in forest areas on level ground was of adequate accuracy when the spruce component was larger than 75%.

AB Room temperature single photon counting measurements on intact leaves at low excitation energies have been analyzed using a four exponential kinetic model. The observed lifetimes and relative yields of the components have been compared to those obtained on isolated chloroplasts of the same species. At steady state conditions of fluorescence (Fs-level, reached after 5 min of preillumination with 625 nm pulsed laser light), the overall decay is characterized by lifetimes of approx. 20-30 ps (tau1), 80-100 ps (tau2), 400-450 ps (tau3), and 800-900 ps (tau4). By closing the reaction centers of PS II (application of the herbicide DCMU) the lifetimes of the two slowest components tau3 and tau4 increase by a factor of 4. The lifetimes of the two fastest components (tau1 and tau2) were found to be independent of PS II trap closure. A comparison of literature lifetime data of isolated pigment proteins (Hodges and Moya, 1986, Wittmershaus et al., 1987) with our results, obtained for the in vivo plant system suggsts that two fast decays can be attributed to PS I whereas three lifetime components are necessary to describe the fluorescence decay of PS II.

AB Ground radiometry was used to gather spectral data from different targets of a citrus canopy, in order to analyze the effect of solar zenith angle and proportion of diffuse radiation on spectral reflectance. Results have shown that the variation in solar angle causes significant changes in nadir-sensed reflectance from vegetation, which exhibits a marked diurnal pattern with a minimum slightly shifted from the solar noon. This fact is more noticeable in the near-infrared and middle-infrared regions of the spectrum. Furthermore, the visible part of the spectrum has resulted in being highly influenced by the diffuse radiation incident on the canopy, which has been quantified by two different physical parameters: the proportion of diffuse irradiance k(d) and the sky clearness epsilon. It has been shown that the reflectance factor increases linearly with increasing diffuse radiation, but only below a threshold value, above which the reflectance remains constant. On the other hand, the reflectance dependence on the parameter epsilon has allowed us to identify three well-defined zones of sky light conditions, in which reflectance presents a different behavior.

TI MODELING ERRORS IN REMOTE-SENSING IMAGE CLASSIFICATION
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB Standard error assessment techniques in image classification have been primarily concerned with identifying errors in individual pixel assignments. However, these techniques overlook a fundamental fact that image classification is basically a process of generalization. The outputs of this process are often intended to be cartographic objects (e.g., polygons) which are abstract models of reality and may not be verifiable at each pixel. Linking errors with cartographic objects in image classification is a challenging problem in remote sensing. This article proposes a new error assessment methodology for image classification (an error model) in which uncertainties involved in the classification process are estimated through simulations of various steps in image classification. Two error models have been developed to estimate the uncertainties involved in class modeling (training) and boundary generation (boundary pixel allocation). Results derived from two case studies show the validity of the proposed error concept for image classification and its potential for improving image classification.

LA English
DT Article
AB Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composite image data, produced from AVHRR data collected in 1990, were evaluated for locating and mapping the areal extent of wildfires in the boreal forests of Alaska during that year. A technique was developed to map forest fire boundaries by subtracting a late-summer AVHRR NDVI image from an early summer scene. The locations and boundaries of wildfires within the interior region of Alaska were obtained from the Alaska Fire Service, and compared to the AVHRR-derived fire-boundary map. It was found that AVHRR detected 89.5% of all fires with sizes greater than' 2000 ha with no false alarms and that, for most cases, the general shape of the fire boundary detected by AVHRR matched those mapped by field observers. However, the total area contained within the fire boundaries mapped by AVHRR were only 61% of those mapped by the field observers.  However, the AVHRR data used in this study did not span the entire time period during which fires occurred, and it is believed the areal estimates could be improved significantly if an expanded AVHRR data set were used.

This index correlates with the epoxidation state of the xanthophyll cycle pigments and with the efficiency of photosynthesis in control and nitrogen stress canopies, but not in water stress canopies undergoing midday wilting. It is analogous in formulation to the broadband normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and uses reflectance at 531 nm and at a reference wavelength to minimize complications associated with diumal sun angle changes. In conjunction with other methods, this index may lead to improved remote and ground-based estimates of canopy photosynthetic function.

AB Reliable information on global land cover is required to assist the solution of a wide range of environmental problems.  Information from conventional ground-based data has significant deficiencies as demonstrated by an analysis of these sources.  Data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer has been used to carry out land cover classification at continental scales.  The specific data sets that have been used, have substantial limitations and the need for the use of alternate data bases is outlined.  The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) of the Earth Observing System (EOS) will be a substantially better instrument in terms of several spectral, radiometric, and geometric properties than the AVHRR.  However, in terms of its total field of view and frequency of imaging, the instrument will be comparable to the AVHRR for global land cover monitoring.

TI Estimating runoff from pan-Arctic drainage basins for 2002-2019 using an
   improved runoff-storage relationship

AB The Arctic is undergoing dramatic climate and environmental changes. The long-term alterations in river dis-charges from the boreal catchments, which serve as vital links between the ocean and land, are having a pro-found impact on various environmental factors, particularly ocean circulation and sea-ice content. However, comprehensive and continuous monitoring of Arctic river discharge at seasonal or higher temporal resolutions remains challenging. In this study, we propose a new approach to estimate runoff by generating monthly runoff time series at the basin scale. Our method is based on changes in water storage observed by the gravimetric satellites Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on mission since 2002. The method utilizes an empirical runoff-storage (R-S) relationship, offering simplicity and low computational burden while maintaining good accuracy in estimating runoff. To validate our method, we utilize in-situ runoff measurements from the seven largest boreal drainage basins spanning the period from 2002 to 2019, encompassing a total of 18 years. We divide these 18 years of observations into two phases: a training phase (8 years) and a testing phase (10 years). The results indicate that the R-S method established during the training phase yields monthly Nash -Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values ranging from 0.65 to 0.92 when compared to in-situ runoff measurements. Moreover, the method demonstrates a consistent performance in estimating runoff during the testing phase (monthly NSE: 0.67-0.84). With the exception of the Ob and Mackenzie basins, which exhibit distinct climatic conditions and hydrological networks, the R-S models are interchangeable across basins. This makes it suitable for both temporal and spatial extrapolation to fill data gaps, provided that accurate water and snow storage data are available. All in all, our method enables the reconstruction of monthly surface runoff across the entire boreal basins between 2002 and 2019. The results indicate an average annual runoff of 3200 +/- 160 Gt over the study area of 1.58 x 107 km2. To evaluate the accuracy of our estimates, we compare the total runoff estimates ob-tained using the R-S method with those from 12 model estimates. Our estimates exhibit the highest correlation with available in-situ runoff measurements and yield monthly NSE values >0.57 for five out of the twelve model estimates. This study presents a convenient method to address the urgent need for comprehensive, continuous, and monthly temporal resolution of runoff estimates throughout the entire boreal region.

AB Knowledge of oil distribution and characteristics (e.g., oil type, oil thickness, concentration, volume, etc.) is valuable for oil spill response and post-spill assessment. Optical remote sensing has the advantage of collecting information in multiple spectral bands, thus being able to classify and quantify different oil emulsions. However, most spectral characteristics of oil emulsions have been obtained from laboratory measurements, and it is unclear how to apply these lab-based findings to airborne or satellite observations of highly heterogeneous oil patches. This study proposes a three-dimensional (3D) unmixing model to explain AVIRIS image spectra of oil-containing pixels with both horizontal and vertical mixing effects. Based on the 3D unmixing model, an oil concentration lookup table (LUT) and LUT-based oil concentration mapping method are developed to quantify oil concentrations from AVIRIS observations, with the results validated through the use of a spectral similarity index. Using spatial and spectral resampling simulations, we also propose an approach to extend the LUT to different optical sensors (e.g., Landsat) in order to map oil concentrations, yet such an approach requires further research to validate and improve.

AB Snow covers a maximum of 47 million km2 of Earth's northern hemisphere each winter and is an important component of the planet's energy balance, hydrology cycles, and ecosystems. Monitoring regional and global snow cover has increased in urgency in recent years due to warming temperatures and declines in snow cover extent. Optical satellite instruments provide large-scale observations of snow cover, but cloud cover and dense forest canopy can reduce accuracy in mapping snow cover. Remote camera networks deployed for wildlife monitoring operate below cloud cover and in forests, representing a virtually untapped source of snow cover observations to supplement satellite observations. Using images from 1181 wildlife cameras deployed by the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research (NINA), we compared snow cover extracted from camera images to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products during winter months of 2018-2020. Ordinal snow classifications (scale = 0-4) from cameras were closely related to normalized difference snow index (NDSI) values from the MODIS Terra Snow Cover Daily L3 Global 500 m (MOD10A1) Collection 6 product (R2 = 0.70). Tree canopy cover, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and image color mode influenced agreement between camera images and MOD10A1 NDSI values. For MOD10A1F, MOD10A1's corresponding cloud-gap filled product, agreement with cloud-gap filled values decreased from 78.5% to 56.4% in the first three days of cloudy periods and stabilized thereafter. Using our camera data as validation, we derived a threshold to create daily binary maps of snow cover from the MOD10A1 product. The threshold corresponding to snow presence was an NDSI value of 40.50, which closely matched a previously defined global binary threshold of 40 using the MOD10A2 8-day product. These analyses demonstrate the utility of camera trap networks for validation of snow cover products from satellite remote sensing, as well as their potential to identify sources of inaccuracy.

AB Understanding the seasonality of, and contributors to, surface urban heat island (SUHI) will pave the way for developing more generalized urban cooling strategies. The direction and shape of SUHI seasonal hysteresis have been thought to be background climate dependent. However, there remains a relative paucity of knowledge about the patterns and driving mechanisms of such hysteretic phenomena across diverse climates. Here we show that the seasonal hysteretic cycles of SUHI in the daytime and nighttime across Chinese cities between 2003 and 2020 can be identified as eight and six primary patterns, characterized by diverse and complex behaviors including clockwise, anti-clockwise, twisted, concave, and convex directions/loops. The urban-rural differences in evapotranspiration (& UDelta;ET) and surface albedo (& UDelta;ABD) have been recognized as the primary contributors to SUHI in the daytime and nighttime and their seasonal hysteresis, respectively, as measured by structural equation modeling (SEM) and time lead/lag analysis. These biophysical mechanisms for diverse seasonal hysteretic cycles of SUHI in China re-emphasized climate context dependencies in SUHI terms. Furthermore, the observed divergence of SUHI hysteresis typologies within similar background climates highlighted the additional drivers of complex urban systems because SUHI is a combined result of rural background and urban characteristics. We conclude that the cost-effective UHI mitigation strategies creating synergies or avoiding trade-offs among seasons should be climate context-specific and tailored to local urbanicity.

AB InSAR and associated analytic methods enable relative surface deformation measurements from low Earth orbit with a potential accuracy of centimeters to millimeters. However, assessing the actual accuracy can be quite difficult. The analytic methods are complicated enough that naive analytic error propagation is infeasible, and, in many settings, InSAR practitioners lack sufficient ground truth to assess results. Phase noise due to partial decorrelation from changes in the scattering properties of the ground is a prominent source of accuracy loss. In this paper we present a method to assess the loss of precision due to this component of phase noise. The proposed method consists of generating synthetic data stacks whose statistical properties match those of the actual input SAR data stacks, and then using the synthetic data for an ensemble calculation. The spread of the results of the ensemble calculation indicates the loss of precision. We show examples of the ensemble analysis at a mining operation in South Africa, and demonstrate the ability to estimate the precision of two InSAR deformation retrieval methods on a point-by-point and epoch-by-epoch basis.

AB Functional diversity is a critical component driving ecosystem functioning. Spatially explicit data of plant functional traits and diversity are essential for understanding biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning. Here we retrieved three morphological traits (95th quantile height, leaf area index, foliage height diversity) and three physiological traits (chlorophyll a + b content, specific leaf area, equivalent water thickness) from airborne laser scanning and multispectral Sentinel-2 data, respectively. We found airborne LiDAR-derived parameters corre-lated well with in-situ plot-level morphological data (R2 >= 0.67). For satellite-derived physiological traits, partial least squares regression (PLSR) obtained higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.26-0.43, cross-validation with in -situ community-weighted mean (CWM) leaf physiological trait data) than a vegetation index (VI) approach. The remotely-sensed traits were used as input to estimate multi-trait functional diversity (FD) indices in a species-rich subtropical mountainous forest. Finally, we investigated the influence of single-trait CWMs, multi-trait FD indices and environmental variables on remotely-derived aboveground ecosystem carbon stocks (aboveground biomass, AGB) and primary productivity (kernel normalized difference vegetation index, kNDVI). CWMs of all functional traits were significant predictors of AGB and kNDVI, as suggested by the mass-ratio hypothesis. Morphological FD indices were also important predictors of AGB and kNDVI, indicating effects of complementarity in crown architectures. In best-fit multivariate models, the first principal component CWM of morphological traits and that of physiological traits were the most important predictors of AGB and kNDVI, respectively. The FD index of morphological richness was additionally selected in the best-fit models for AGB and kNDVI at ecosystem and landscape scales. Our work highlights the potential of using remotely-sensed functional traits to assess the relationship between trait diversity and ecosystem functioning across large, contiguous areas.

AB Satellite observation can significantly reduce the uncertainties in CO2 emission estimations compared to insuf-ficient field data. However, big challenges remain in developing remote sensing-based models for mapping concentrations of dissolved carbon dioxide (cCO2) in lakes at regional or global scales. We developed a cCO2 estimation model using Sentinel-3-derived lake environmental variables and near-synchronous field cCO2 data from 16 lakes in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huai River (ML_YHR) basins in Eastern China (N = 248). Stepwise quadratic polynomial regressions of several combinations of chlorophyll -a (Chl-a), water temperature (Tw), Secchi disk depth (ZSD), and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR)-related variables were tested and validated to select the best approach. The final model showed high performance in calibration and validation (R2 > 0.72, RMSE < 6.35 mu mol L-1, MAPE < 30.31%). The model sensitivity analysis, based on Monte Carlo simulations, showed the model's estimated bias as <25% based on uncertainties of all input variables. Spatial and temporal dynamics of dissolved CO2 concentrations in 113 lakes (>= 10 km2) in the ML_YHR basins were mapped from 2016 to 2021 using the Sentinel-3 data. The result showed that CO2 concentrations were low in the summer and autumn but high in the winter and spring with dramatic variations (e.g., mean coefficient of variation: 52.59%). The annual mean CO2 concentrations of lakes revealed that about 28% of the lakes acted as weak atmospheric CO2 sinks (14.96 +/- 1.13 mu mol L-1) while the rest were sources (19.22 +/- 2.02 mu mol L-1), compared with a mean concentration of CO2 atmospheric equilibrium (16.29 mu mol L-1). CO2 concentrations decreased with increasing eutrophication and decreasing lake size (p < 0.05). This study advances current knowledge about CO2 emissions from emerging meso-eutrophic lakes and shows how satellite remote sensing can expand the spatiotemporal coverage of lake CO2.

AB Lake ice provides important social and economic services to local communities, in addition to being a sensitive indicator of climate change. The reduction of ground observations of freshwater ice has led to an increased reliance on the use of satellite remote sensing data. There is currently interest in the retrieval of lake ice properties (e.g., ice thickness, bubble radius, roughness) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Roughness at the ice-water interface is particularly important as it has been identified as the dominant mechanism for increasing SAR backscatter throughout the ice season and must be considered in numerical radiative transfer models. Therefore, this study determines optimal ice-water interface roughness height for two subarctic lakes in northern Canada and models backscatter throughout two ice seasons using the snow microwave radiative transfer (SMRT) model. The two lakes for this study are Noell Lake and Malcolm Ramsay Lake. Field observations of ice thickness, snow depth, snow density, and the Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) are used to parameterize SMRT. Modelled L, C, and X-band backscatter at different incidence angles is assessed using SAR imagery from multiple satellite missions. Root mean square errors ranged from 0.38 to 1.45 dB for Noell Lake and 0.70 to 2.33 dB for Malcolm Ramsay Lake. Discrepancies between modelled and observed backscatter were found to be connected to the representation of roughness at different interfaces within the ice column and changes that occurred during freeze-melt events. These results provide insight into how changes in ice properties impact backscatter throughout the ice season. SMRT is valuable for modelling backscatter from lake ice during the cold season and could be used to develop retrieval algorithms for estimating ice-water interface roughness. This would allow for the development of other inversion models for retrieval of surface ice conditions and ice thickness.

AB Widespread changes in vegetation cover and composition are driving strong impacts on Arctic ecosystem functioning and global climate feedbacks. An accurate characterization of tundra vegetation composition is required to understand how the Arctic will respond to future climate change. However, quantifying tundra vegetation composition over large areas is challenging as commonly-used satellite observations are too coarse, spatially and spectrally, to differentiate low-lying tundra vegetation types. Recent airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy platforms provide better data to characterize vegetation composition. Yet, our ability to characterize vegetation composition with imaging spectroscopy remains largely unexplored in the Arctic, particularly due to a lack of ground observations needed to train and test classification models. To address this problem, we collected very-high-resolution (VHR, similar to 5 cm) unoccupied aerial system (UAS) imagery at three lowArctic tundra sites located on the Seward Peninsula, western Alaska. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of integrating imagery from the UAS and the hyperspectral Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) airborne instrument to map the fractional composition of 12 key Arctic plant functional types (PFTs). To this end, we first mapped the 12 PFTs from our VHR UAS imagery using random forest classification. We then used these UAS-derived PFT maps as ground truth to develop partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to predict the fractional cover (FCover) of each PFT from AVIRIS-NG imagery. We evaluated the performance of our PLSR models using reserved UAS samples, as well as by mapping PFT FCover and dominant PFT for large tundra landscapes. Our results show that 1) Arctic PFTs can be effectively mapped using VHR UAS imagery, with overall accuracy between 86% and 92%, 2) when the UAS mapped PFTs were used to inform PLSR scaling models, the FCover of the 12 PFTs could be effectively estimated from AVIRIS-NG imagery with a mean absolute error (MAE) <0.13, and 3) our PLSR models outperformed traditional, fully constrained least-squares (FCLS) linear mixture analysis and produced high-quality, spatially contiguous PFT FCover and PFT maps that captured vegetation spatial patterns with similar accuracy to those developed from UAS imagery. The developed PLSR models have the potential to be broadly applied for quantifying vegetation composition with AVIRIS-NG images to help monitor tundra vegetation dynamics and improve process-based modeling of tundra ecosystems.

AB Vegetation optical depth (VOD) from satellite passive microwave sensors has enabled monitoring of aboveground biomass carbon dynamics by building a relationship with static carbon maps over space and then applying this relationship to VOD time series. However, uncertainty in this relationship arises from changes in water stress, as VOD is mainly determined by vegetation water content, which varies at diurnal to interannual scales, and de-pends on changes in both biomass and relative moisture content. Here, we studied the reliability of using VOD from various microwave frequencies and temporal aggregation methods for estimating decadal biomass carbon dynamics at the global scale. We used the VOD diurnal variations to represent the magnitude of vegetation water content buffering caused by climatic variations for a constant amount of dry biomass carbon. This magnitude of VOD diurnal variations was then used to evaluate the likelihood of VOD decadal variations in reflecting decadal dry biomass carbon changes. We found that SMOS-IC L-VOD and LPDR X-VOD can be reliably used to estimate decadal carbon dynamics for 76.7% and 69.9% of the global vegetated land surface, respectively, yet cautious use is warranted for some areas such as the eastern Amazon rainforest. Moreover, the annual VOD aggregated from the 95% percentile of the nighttime VOD retrievals was proved to be the most suitable parameter for estimating decadal biomass carbon dynamics among the temporal aggregation methods. Finally, we validated the use of annual VOD for estimating interannual carbon dynamics by comparing VOD changes between adjacent years against eddy covariance estimations of gross primary production from flux sites over several land cover classes across the globe. Despite the large difference in spatial scales between them, the positive correlation obtained supports the capability of satellite VOD in quantifying interannual carbon dynamics.

AB The detection of clouds is one of the first steps in the pre-processing of remotely sensed data. At coarse spatial resolution (> 100 m), clouds are bright and generally distinguishable from other landscape surfaces. At very high-resolution (< 3 m), detecting clouds becomes a significant challenge due to the presence of smaller features, with spectral characteristics similar to other land cover types, and thin (partially transparent) cloud forms. Furthermore, at this resolution, clouds can cover many thousands of pixels, making both the center and boundaries of the clouds prone to pixel contamination and variations in the spectral intensity. Techniques that rely solely on the spectral information of clouds underperform in these situations. In this study, we propose a multi-regional and multi-sensor deep learning approach for the detection of clouds in very high-resolution WorldView satellite imagery. A modified UNet-like convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for the task of semantic segmentation in the regions of Vietnam, Senegal, and Ethiopia strictly using RGB + NIR spectral bands. In addition, we demonstrate the superiority of CNNs cloud predicted mapping accuracy of 81-91%, over traditional methods such as Random Forest algorithms of 57-88%. The best performing UNet model has an overall accuracy of 95% in all regions, while the Random Forest has an overall accuracy of 89%. We conclude with promising future research directions of the proposed methods for a global cloud cover implementation.

AB Seasonal snow melt dominates the hydrologic budget across a large portion of the globe. Snow accumulation and melt vary over a broad range of spatial scales, preventing accurate extrapolation of sparse in situ observations to watershed scales. The lidar onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation, Satellite (ICESat-2) was designed for precise mapping of ice sheets and sea ice, and here we assess the feasibility of snow depth-mapping using ICESat-2 data in more complex and rugged mountain landscapes. We explore the utility of ATL08 Land and Vegetation Height and ATL06 Land Ice Height differencing from reference elevation datasets in two end member study sites. We analyze-3 years of data for Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in Idaho's Owyhee Mountains and Wolverine Glacier in southcentral Alaska's Kenai Mountains. Our analysis reveals decimeter-scale uncertainties in derived snow depth and glacier mass balance at the watershed scale. Both accuracy and precision decrease as slope increases: the magnitudes of the median and median of the absolute deviation of elevation errors (MAD) vary from-0.2 m for slopes <5<degrees> to >1 m for slopes >20 degrees. For glacierized regions, failure to account for intra-and inter-annual evolution of glacier surface elevations can strongly bias ATL06 elevations, resulting in under-estimation of the mass balance gradient with elevation. Based on these results, we conclude that ATL08 and ATL06 observations are best suited for characterization of watershed-scale snow depth and mass balance gra-dients over relatively shallow slopes with thick snowpacks. In these regions, ICESat-2 elevation residual-derived snow depth and mass balance transects can provide valuable watershed scale constraints on terrain parameter -and model-derived estimates of snow accumulation and melt.

AB Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a consolidated tool for detecting and monitoring ground surface displacements. The availability of satellite data with free access policy and high monitoring capabilities (in terms of resolution and acquisition frequency) is increasing. Moreover, the first continental displacement map of Europe will be freely available in quarter one 2022 by the latest Copernicus Service, the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS). The EGMS will provide ground displacement maps, updated every year, delivering valuable information to a wide range of users, such as public or governmental institutions, industry, academia, and citizens. This vast amount of information needs semi-automatic tools and methodologies to derive user -oriented products that can be easily used by land use and urban planning decision-makers, who are often un-familiar with PSI. This work proposes a semi-automatic procedure to identify damage prone areas in urban environments from wide-area PSI displacement maps. The proposed method identifies the most significant Active Deformation Areas (ADAs) to calculate three products based on the displacement intensity gradient: the Gradient Intensity Map, the Gradient Vectors and Time Series, and the Potential Damage Map. These products allow identifying buildings and urban structures exposed to potential damage, which could be followed by a more detailed building-based vulnerability and risk assessment. The methodology has been applied to an area of the province of Granada (Andalucta, Spain) but it can be applied to any other urban environment where PSI displacement maps are available. To demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the proposed method, results are discussed in five coastal resorts (Cerro Gordo, Punta de la Mona, Marina del Este, Alfa Mar, and Monte de los Almendros), strongly affected by slope movements. The methodology allowed to derive 175 ADAs from about 200,000 measurement points. About 15% of the resulting area has been found to correspond to high or very high gradient intensity class, and 192 out of 633 buildings have been identified to be prone to moderate or high potential damage. A damage prediction test has been realized through Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, based on a damage inventory map derived from field surveys. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology to localize damaged or potentially damaged buildings, substantially reducing the time of analysis.

AB After more than two decades of successful provision of global burned area data the MODIS mission is near to its end. Therefore, using alternative images to generate moderate resolution burned area maps becomes critical to guarantee temporal continuity of these products. This paper presents the development of a hybrid algorithm based on Copernicus Sentinel-3 (S3) Synergy (SYN) data and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m active fires for global detection of burned areas. Using the synergistic and co-located measurements of OLCI and SLSTR instruments on board S3A and S3B, the SYN product offers global, near-daily surface reflectance data at 300 m for both sensors. Our algorithm relied on SYN shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands to compute a multi-temporal separability index that enhanced the burn signal. Active fires from the VIIRS sensor were used to generate spatio-temporal clusters for determining local detection thresholds. Active fires were filtered from those thresholds to obtain the seeds from which a contextual growing was applied to extract burned patches. The algorithm was processed globally for 2019 data to generate a new burned area product, named FireCCIS310. Based on a stratified random sampling, error estimates showed an important reduction of omission errors versus other global burned area products while keeping the commission errors at a similar level (Oe = 41.2% +/- 3.0%, Ce = 19.2% +/- 1.7%). The new FireCCIS310 dataset included 4.99 million km2 for the year 2019, which implied around 1 million more than the precursor FireCCI51 product, based on MODIS 250 m reflectance values. Temporal reporting accuracy was improved as well, detecting 53% of the burned pixels within a 0-1 day difference. Besides, the new product was much less affected by the border effects than FireCCI51, as a result of an improved active fire filtering process. The FireCCIS310 product is accessible through the CCI Open Data Portal (https://climate.esa.int/es/odp/#/dashboard, last accessed on July 2022).

AB Having the ability to make accurate assessments of above ground biomass (AGB) at high spatial resolution is invaluable for the management of dryland forest resources in areas at risk from deforestation, forest degradation pressure and climate change impacts. This study reports on the use of satellite-based synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and multispectral imagery for estimating AGB by correlating satellite observations with ground truth data collected on forest plots from dryland forests in the Chobe National Park, Botswana. We undertook nineteen quantitative experiments with Sentinel-1 (S1), and Sentinel-2 (S2) and tested simple and multivariate regression including parametric (linear) and non-parametric (random forests) algorithms, to explore the optimal approaches for AGB estimation. The largest AGB value of 145 Mg/ha was found in northern Chobe while a large part of the study area (85%) is characterized by low AGB values (< 80 Mg/ha), with an average estimated at 51 Mg/ha. The results show that the AGB estimated using SAR backscatter values from vertical transmit receive (VV) polari-zation is more accurate than that based on horizontal receive (VH) polarization, accounting for 58% of the variance compared to 32%. Nevertheless, the combination of S1 SAR and S2 multispectral image data produced the best fit to the ground observations for dryland forests explaining 83% of the variance with an accuracy of 89%. Furthermore, the optimal AGB model performance was achieved with a random forest (RF) regression trees algorithm using S1 (SAR) and S2 (multispectral) image data (R2 = 0.95; RMSE = 0.25 Mg/ha). From the 11 vegetation indices tested, GNDVI, Normalized Difference Red Edge (NDRE1), and NDVI obtained the highest linear relationship with AGB (R2 = 0.71 and R2 = 0.56, p < 0.001), however, GNDVI and NDRE1 improved the AGB estimation at medium to high-density forests compared to NDVI. The GRVI and EVI were the least correlated with AGB (R2 = 0.09 and R2 = 0.31) at a significance level of p < 0.001, respectively. We show that NDVI saturates in areas with >80 Mg/ha AGB, whereas the inclusion of SAR backscatter and optical red edge bands (B5) significantly reduces saturation effects in areas of high biomass. GNDVI and red edge (B5) derived vege-tation indices have more potential for estimating AGB in dryland forests than NDVI. Our results demonstrate that dryland AGB can be estimated with a reasonable level of precision from open access Earth observation data using multivariate random forest regression.

AB To better understand the dynamics of human settlements, thorough knowledge of the uncertainty in geospatial built-up surface datasets is critical. While frameworks for localized accuracy assessments of categorical gridded data have been proposed to account for the spatial non-stationarity of classification accuracy, such approaches have not been applied to (binary) built-up land data. Such data differs from other data such as land cover data, due to considerable variations of built-up surface density across the rural-urban continuum resulting in switches of class imbalance, causing sparsely populated confusion matrices based on small underlying sample sizes. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by testing common agreement measures for their suitability and plausibility to measure the localized accuracy of built-up surface data. We examine the sensitivity of localized accuracy to the assessment support, as well as to the unit of analysis, and analyze the relationships between local accuracy and density / structure-related properties of built-up areas, across rural-urban trajectories and over time. Our ex-periments are based on the multi-temporal Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) and a reference database for the state of Massachusetts (USA). We find strong variation of suitability among commonly used agreement measures, and varying levels of sensitivity to the assessment support. We then apply our framework to assess localized GHSL data accuracy over time from 1975 to 2014. Besides increasing accuracy along the rural-urban gradient, we find that accuracy generally increases over time, mainly driven by peri-urban densification pro-cesses in our study area. Moreover, we find that localized densification measures derived from the GHSL tend to overestimate peri-urban densification processes that occurred between 1975 and 2014, due to higher levels of omission errors in the GHSL epoch 1975.

AB The growing production and use of plastics are becoming a serious progressive issue and people pay increasing attention to the effects of plastics on ecosystems and human health. The availability of hyperspectral data from space sensors inspired us to study the feasibility to detect and identify different types of plastics in aircraft-, Goafen-5 (GF-5) and PRISMA satellite data by means of deep-, and machine learning models trained with spectral signatures. In this context, various inhouse and public spectral libraries are used to create a compre-hensive database with mixed pixels of different plastic and non-plastic materials. The endmembers of plastic types involved in this study are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polystyrene (PS), covering 95% of the global production. Additionally, some important varieties of industrial plastics types such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyamide (PA), polycarbonate (PC), and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) were included in the investigations. Different samples with varying optical properties (color, brightness, transmissivity) have been selected for each plastic type. As non-plastic materials we have chosen spectra of vegetation, rocks, soils and minerals contained in the public US libraries (ECOSTRESS and USGS). The number of spectra for the training of the deep learning and machine learning models was enlarged by a random linear mixing method and the resulting database was separated into a training and a test group for subsequent multi-label classification. Algorithms selected are a convolutional neural network (CNN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). To investigate the transferability to any hyperspectral image data obtained by air-, and spacecraft sensors, we opted for a unifi-cation of the spectral response functions (SRF) and the spectral sampling intervals of all data. Validation is accomplished based on the test group of the spectral database, and tested by controlled laboratory and aircraft experiments recorded over surfaces with varying background materials. Results are further analyzed for the influence of different noise quantities and abundance levels. The performance of the three models is roughly balanced for the validation of the spectral data with an overall accuracy of 97%, 96%, and 95% for the CNN, RF, and SVM, models respectively. In the controlled lab experiments, various accuracy indicators, such as the recall rates and the comprehensive metrics F1-score, OA, and Kappa suggest the RF classifier as the most robust one, followed by the SVM and CNN models. As for the evaluation of the aircraft data from controlled experiments, the RF further outperforms the other two models, behaving most robustly and reliably against conditions with un-known plastics and unknown background surfaces. Thus, the RF was used to classify the ten types of plastics mentioned above in one GF-5 and two PRISMA satellite recordings of the same area. In comparison of both sensor systems, the RF produced high quality and transferable results for detecting plastic mainly related to green-houses, sport fields, photovoltaic constructions and industrial sites that are discussed in detail in this paper.

AB The success of space-based forest defoliation monitoring beyond thematic classification hinges on the ability to link units of continuous foliar change with associated units of spectral or vegetation index change across different systems. To explore this, we used multi-temporal Landsat sensor data with respect to three defoliation metrics (shoot-based estimates (%), frass biomass (kg.ha(-1)), and proportion of foliar loss) across three different forest systems in the United States. While shoot-based defoliation was measured in the field, the later two defoliation metrics were estimated based on the insect phenology model, BioSIM. The systems include spruce budworm (SBW, Choristoneura fumiferana C). in heterogenous mixed forests, Minnesota, jack pine budworm (JPBW, Cho-ristoneura pinus F). in homogenous pine forests, Wisconsin, and spongy moth (SGM, Lymantria dispar dispar L). in mixed broad-leaved forests, Maryland. Our generalized annual defoliation model for budworm was poor (R-adj(2) = 0.35, RMSE = 23.70%) due to difficulty in detecting SBW defoliation in Minnesota. Thus, individual annual JPBW shoot-based defoliation models (R-adj(2) = 0.27 to 0.75 and RMSE = 19.16% to 11.32%) outperformed the SBW models (R-adj(2) = 0.08 to 0.27, RMSE = 23.18% to 34.13%). Cross-system differences between rates of change in ground-based metrics of defoliation with respect to observed change in spectral index values (dVI) were significant for shoot-based estimates of percent annual defoliation for SGM vs. JPBW (p-values < 1.00 x 10(-4)) and SGM vs. SBW (p-values < 4.60 x 10(-3)). However, such comparison between SGM and JPBW were not significant when either frass biomass (kg.ha(-1), p-value = 0.46) or proportion of foliage loss was used (p-value = 0.67). For a given unit of defoliation, the magnitude of vegetation index change, dVI, was significantly different between SGM and JPBW for each defoliation metric used (p-values < 1.00 x 10(-4)), but not between SGM and SBW (p-value = 0.47) or between JPBW and SBW (p-value = 0.06) when shoot-based annual defoliation metrics were used. This study is first to report that, for a given quantity of defoliation, substantial differences in both the magnitude and direction of vegetation index change exists for different defoliator systems, which currently precludes the development of a viable, unified defoliation model. However, outcomes of this research provide an important step in our understanding of these defoliator systems that may enable specific scaling of continuous defoliation at landscape levels and across defoliator systems in the future.

AB Tropospheric delays (TDs) limit the accurate detection of slow slope motion using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), especially in subtropical coastal regions prone to frequent changes in humidity. Although TDs can be estimated through external weather data, their spatiotemporal resolution and data availability are greatly limited, which is not applicable for individual slopes. This paper presents new TD correction methods for slopes with both small dimensions and small elevation changes. We simultaneously estimated and eliminated the TD signal from a line-of-sight (LOS) time series through a blind source separation (i.e., independent component analysis). The stratified TD sources were isolated according to a spatially elevation-linked and temporally pe-riodic independent-component (IC), which was determined via a correlation test and power spectrum analysis. Hence, the TD was corrected without the use of any external weather products/meteorological data and had unprecedented spatiotemporal details equivalent to the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed method was verified using CosmoSkyMed (CSK) and Sentinel-1 (SNT-1) images covering a slope in Tai O, Lantau Island, Hong Kong, and validated using a series of geodetic, meteorological, and hydrological data. Up to 3-4-cm relative TDs were measured in the LOS directions of CSK and SNT-1. The relative TD exhibited a slower incre-ment rate than the slope elevation and was largely affected by specific air conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity) on the SAR image-acquisition days. The analysis of InSAR data yielded reasonably good estimates of millimeter-scale downslope slips (due to increases in pore-water pressure in the wet season) and upslope rebound (due to soil shrinkage in the dry season). It was found that soil swelling and shrinkage of the slope (also known as seasonal ratcheting) and the reclamation were likely regulated by rainfall and sea levels, respectively. Although the slope motion in Tai O was determined to be small (i.e., seasonal variations of 10 mm), the TD correction reduced the root-mean-square error by 42.3%, such that InSAR time-series measurements with millimeter-level accuracy (potentially 1-3 mm) were obtained.

AB Remote estimation of phytoplankton primary production has long been recognized as an important method for investigating the responses of aquatic ecosystems to global climate change. The theory-based primary production model (TPM), one of the earlier proposed models, is potentially applicable to a variety of water bodies because of its semi-analytical nature. Its accuracy is highly dependent on whether the photophysiological response of phytoplankton is adequately parameterized, specifically the assimilation number (P-max(B)) and the light saturation parameter (Ek). The remote assignment of P-max(B) and Ek is acknowledged to be a challenging task, and the limited progress has impeded extensive use of the TPM. In this study, we proposed a machine learning algorithm, the enhanced random forest regression (ERFR), to retrieve P-max(B) and Ek from satellite observations. The ERFR were then integrated with the TPM (together termed as TPMERFR) to estimate daily depth-integrated primary production (IPP) in clear to turbid waters. The ERFR was trained and validated using in situ datasets from a broad range of trophic and biogeographic conditions, covering oceanic, coastal, and inland water bodies. Evaluations with independent in situ data and matchup data showed that the ERFR outperformed conventional empirical and semi-analytical algorithms, and it could better capture the variability of P-max(B) and Ek than look-up-table methods. The root mean square difference (RMSD) of the satellite-based IPP estimates from the TPMERFR remained within 0.27. In contrast, the benchmark models generally yielded IPP estimates with RMSDs of 0.27-0.62. The TPMERFR was then implemented to climatological satellite products (2010-2019) to reassess global IPP. Reasonable spatial distributions of IPP were preliminarily demonstrated, especially in polar, coastal, and inland waters. These results indicated the potential utility of the TPMERFR to generate seamless IPP distributions in clear to turbid waters.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been a powerful tool for deforestation detection in tropical rainforests. Polarimetric SAR (POLSAR) data are acquired in a quad-polarization mode, and L-band POLSAR data in particular are one of the few SAR data types that preserve the dielectric properties and structures of the scatterer. POLSAR data consist of 2 x 2 scattering matrices and consequently offer superior target recognition compared with dual-polarization data. In this study, we applied scattering power decomposition suitable for detecting deforestation in near real-time to POLSAR data obtained from the Earth observation sensor Phased Array type L band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2). The reflection symmetry condition is known to apply to natural distributed objects (i.e., the cross-correlation between co-and cross-polarization data is zero). Inspired by this, we theoretically and experimentally examined the volume scattering power component to distinguish natural forests from the surrounding area. Two important results were verified for natural forests: as the window size of the ensemble average increases, (i) the coherency matrix approaches a simple theoretical form and (ii) the volume scattering power becomes dominant among the scattering power components. Based on these results, we constructed an algorithm that applies scattering power decomposition for detecting deforestation. We produced reference data using high-resolution optical images and evaluated the performance of the derived deforestation map in the Amazon natural forest when employing various window sizes for the ensemble average. At an optimal window size of 15 x 15 pixels, the deforestation detection performance reached a user's accuracy of 94.9% +/- 1.5%, a producer's accuracy of 72.3% +/- 1.2%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.816 +/- 0.0039. Sparse trees left after logging increased the volume scattering power and reduced the producer's accuracy. The proposed algorithm can contribute to deforestation detection with slightly lower accuracy than that of the annual map provided by Global Forest Change. Further, the proposed algorithm is robust to the seasonal variations in tropical rainforests and temporal variations in the deforestation process. Consequently, the proposed algorithm employing the six component scattering power decomposition method can be utilized in near real-time without considering applicable areas in tropical rainforests. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to dual-polarization data, which are acquired by PALSAR-2 much more frequently than POLSAR data. The false detection rate did not increase when using the dual-polarization data; however, the omission error increased considerably compared with that when using POLSAR data owing to the low total power obtained from the dual-polarization data.

AB The upcoming Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) satellite mission aims to provide high quality radiometric measurements for subsequent retrieval of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). The combination of SIF with other observations stemming from the FLEX/Sentinel-3 tandem mission holds the potential to assess complex ecosystem processes. The calibration and validation (cal/val) of these radiometric measurements and derived products are central but challenging components of the mission. This contribution outlines strategies for the assessment of in situ radiometric measurements and retrieved SIF. We demonstrate how in situ spectrometer measurements can be analysed in terms of radiometric, spectral and spatial uncertainties. The analysis of more than 200 k spectra yields an average bias between two radiometric measurements by two individual spectrometers of 8%, with a larger variability in measurements of downwelling radiance (25%) compared to upwelling radiance (6%). Spectral shifts in the spectrometer relevant for SIF retrievals are consistently below 1 spectral pixel (up to 0.75). Found spectral shifts appear to be mostly dependent on temperature (as measured by a temperature probe in the instrument). Retrieved SIF shows a low variability of 1.8% compared with a noise reduced SIF estimate based on APAR. A combination of airborne imaging and in situ non-imaging fluorescence spectroscopy highlights the importance of a homogenous sampling surface and holds the potential to further uncover SIF retrieval issues as here shown for early evening acquisitions. Our experiments clearly indicate the need for careful site selection, measurement protocols, as well as the need for harmonized processing. This work thus contributes to guiding cal/val activities for the upcoming FLEX mission.

AB Traditional eddy detection methods can well identify eddies with long lifespans (usually >4 weeks) and strong hydrographic features. Eddies with shorter lifespans or intermittent features are arduous to detect and might be eliminated or misclassified during the detection. However, these eddies have been reported as a majority of the mesoscale eddies in global oceans. This study developed a novel eddy identification method for those eddies. Different from the traditional eddy detection performed based on a snapshot of observations in the horizontal plane, this novel identification method was developed on the evolution of eddies in the temporal dimension. It efficiently avoids the failure in detecting eddies with inconspicuous features during some stages of their evolutions and also eliminates excessive detection. The developed method was implemented to detect Capricorn Eddies based on 26 years of sea-level anomaly from satellite altimetry. Capricorn Eddies are transient and intermittent phenomena induced as a result of the East Australian Current colliding with the continental shelf edge near the Fraser Island, Australia. Using the new identification method, the characteristics of Capricorn Eddies, including their temporal and spatial scales, intensity preferences and evolution details, were resolved. Remarkable seasonal variations of the Capricorn Eddies were also revealed. Based on these findings, a comprehensive overview of Capricorn Eddies, which is crucial for further understanding the variabilities of regional biogeochemical processes and ocean ecosystems, was provided. The developed method will also provide potential insight into the unrevealed eddies in the global oceans.

AB Forests play a significant role in mitigating the effects of climate change and regulating the biogeochemical cycles. Water use efficiency (WUE) is an important indicator that links the carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. In the present study, WUE of major forest formations of India was calculated from 2003 to 2018 as the ratio of Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Gross Primary Productivity (GPP, MOD17A2H) to evapotranspiration (ET, MOD16A) using the Google Earth Engine platform. The spatial distribution of WUE was mapped and the inter-annual and monthly variations were analysed. The mean annual WUE of forests ranged from 1.78-2.02 gC kgH2O-1. It was observed that tropical thorn forests had the highest WUE (3.52 +/- 1.08 gC kgH2O-1) and moist alpine scrub had the lowest WUE (1.05 +/- 0.17gC kgH2O-1) among the forest type groups of India. WUE of forests showed an increasing trend with latitude and decreasing trend with elevation. To understand the influence of various bio-meteorological drivers on WUE and their importance in governing these influences, Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used. The bio-meteorological drivers were able to explain 65% of the variability in WUE. Temperature was identified as the most important driver in influencing the WUE of forests. Based on the findings of the study, it can be expected that the global increase in temperature would negatively affect the WUE of the major forest formations of India.

AB Urban development and associated land cover and land use change alter the thermal, hydrological, and physical properties of the land surface. Assessments of surface urban heat island (UHI) usually focused on using remote sensing and land cover data to quantify UHI intensity and spatial distribution within a certain period. However, the mechanisms and complex interactions in landscape dynamics and land surface thermal features are still being assessed. In this study, we developed and implemented a novel approach to characterize landscape thermal conditions by focusing on UHI intensity and its spatiotemporal variation using the recently available time series of Landsat land surface temperature and land cover change products. We analyzed land surface temperature changes in urban and surrounding non-urban lands to quantify the UHI intensity and landscape thermal conditions in the Atlanta and Minneapolis metropolitan areas of the United States. Our results revealed that UHI intensities had averages of 3.4 degrees C and 3.3 degrees C in the Atlanta and Minneapolis metropolitan areas, respectively. The dominant land cover type in rural areas and urban imperviousness cover determines the UHI intensity. Increasing trends of 0.04 degrees C/year and 0.01 degrees C/year in UHI intensity between 1985 and 2018 were found in Atlanta and Minneapolis, respectively. The UHI intensity variations in 1985 and 2018 suggest that the magnitudes and temporal variations of UHI intensity averaged from all urban land cover classes are close to the UHI intensity estimated from the low intensity urban area only while the UHI intensities are more than 2 degrees C larger in medium to high and high intensity urban areas. The UHI intensities estimated from the maximum temperature that have statistically significant increasing trends suggest that the maximum temperature is a good element for measuring UHI effect. Urban land cover dynamics play an important role in controlling temporal variation of UHI and the UHI hotspots. Our findings support the scientific value of implementing the prototype approach as an objective framework to quantify and monitor UHI intensity at a large geographic extent.

AB Sand dunes are one of the most abundant aeolian landforms and play an important role in understanding how aeolian environments evolve. Since the 1970s, remote sensing has enabled large-scale investigations of dunes at comparatively low costs and with temporally continuous observations, which greatly advances our knowledge of aeolian systems. In this context, we provide a review of recent progress in three research topics that have been greatly facilitated by remote sensing techniques. These topics are 1) mapping sand extent and dune types, 2) dune pattern quantification, and 3) monitoring dune dynamics. Sand dune mapping was the early focus of aeolian geomorphologists, and continued progress has been made in refining classification schemes and developing advanced classification techniques. Dune pattern quantification can be resolved in two geomorphometric approaches, and a careful design that takes into consideration the image resolution, the data quality, and the uncertainty in dune discretization is necessary. Dune dynamics typically exhibit as dune migration, dune interactions, and dune fine-scale morphodynamics. The wide application of change detection algorithms, especially COSI-Corr, provides great insights into dune migration, while the exploration of dune interactions is still in its infancy. Future directions are highlighted in four key areas: unifying classification schemes regarding dune morphology, developing methods that are capable of recognizing diverse dune forms at large spatial extents, designing modularized workflows and more complex matching rules to quantify dune migration, and improving quantitative analysis of dune interactions.

AB Much progress has been made in predicting terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) from solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). However, SIF-GPP relationships are mostly built by statistically relating top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF observations (SIFTOC) to eddy covariance flux-tower GPP estimates. We developed a process-based model, based on the mechanistic light response (MLR) model, to mechanistically link SIFTOC with the photosynthetic activity of vegetation. To apply this mechanistic model at the canopy scale, we 1) reformulate the equations by replacing the fraction of open PSII reaction centers (q(L)) and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(Pmax)) with nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and the quantum yield of photosystem II (Phi(P)); 2) reconstruct hemispherical broadband SIF fluxes at photosystem II (PSII) from the directional observed SIFTOC that is contributed from photosystem I and II; 3) estimate other key parameters including KDF (ratio between the rate constants for constitutive heat loss and fluorescence), C-c (chloroplastic CO2 partial pressure), and Gamma* (chloroplastic compensation point of CO2) at the canopy scale based on assumptions and in-situ measurements. A comparison against flux-tower based GPP at a winter-wheat study site, demonstrates that the modeled GPP, driven by SIFTOC at 760 nm, air temperature, incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and directional reflectance in the red and near-infrared region, is able to quantify canopy photosynthesis with good accuracy at both half-hourly (R-2 = 0.85, RMSE = 5.62 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), rRMSE = 9.10%) and daily (R-2 > 0.90, RMSE = 3.25 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and rRMSE = 8.69%) scales. The present model enhances our ability to mechanistically estimate GPP with SIF at the canopy scale, an essential step to model carbon uptake using satellite SIF at regional and global scales.

AB Landslides originating from remote steep slopes render people living downhill vulnerable, unaware of the impending danger. Identifications of slow-moving mountain slopes are possible now due to time series measurement from space using microwave satellite data and the InSAR technique, which potentially can detect displacement at millimetre level. Availability of open-source Sentinel-1 data has revolutionised the study involving landslide kinematics and predicting the time of failure. However, identification of accelerating trend, demarcation of release area and prediction of flow path after failure initiation are still challenging. In this paper, we present a novel method for time and path prediction of landslides using two large landslides (Kikruma and Kotropi) located in the Himalayas in India. Sentinel-1 data stack was processed using the Persistent Scatterer and Small Baseline Subset interferometric techniques to analyse the trend of ground deformation leading to slope failures. The displacement time series of the measurement points, analysed using inverse velocity and modified inverse velocity methods, show that the instability had commenced almost a year or more with the final onset of acceleration triggered by heavy rainfall, couple of weeks prior to the actual failure. The acceleration image created from displacement time series data was clustered using image segmentation techniques to demarcate the release area of landslides. The flow simulation was done using the Voellmy friction model with a high-resolution DEM to predict the flow path. The analysis done for Kikruma and Kotropi landslide case studies with the proposed method provided a safe prediction of the time of landslide with similar to 90% accuracy of the flow path prediction. Results show that the method demonstrated in this study may evolve as an effective tool for landslide early warning in hilly areas.

AB Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter observations are sensitive to hydrologic conditions and vegetation characteristics of land cover. This study conducted a high spatial-resolution investigation (30-m) on the response of dual-polarization C-band (5.6 cm wavelength) SAR backscatter coefficients (sigma degrees) to temporal changes of surface water depth (d(w)) and spatial variations of vegetation characteristics in the south Florida Everglades wetlands. We investigated (1) linear relationships between s. and dw values, and (2) the effects of vegetation density and morphology on sigma degrees-d(w) relationships. We developed a new method to classify pixels with significant linear relationships of multi-temporal sigma degrees and d(w) (R-2 > 0.5 and p-value <0.04), which were termed "Reliable Scatterer" (RS). RS included positive, negative, and a combination of both positive and negative relationships (corresponding to RS+, RS-, RS +/-, respectively). Our analysis revealed spatially varying vegetation densities and morphologies had a significant impact on RS types, where we found RS+ type pixels for woody vegetation, RS +/- for a mix of medium- and high-density herbaceous vegetation using C-band VV (C-VV) data, and RS for sparse herbaceous vegetation using C-VH data. Overall, our study indicates that C-band dual-polarization backscatter is sensitive to water-depth variations for some vegetation types, and this sensitivity has the potential to serve as a reliable indicator for monitoring water depth in wetland environments.

AB Gully erosion is a severe form of soil erosion. However, current understanding of the relative dominance of processes that drive the development of gully erosion is limited. This study investigated the development of gully erosion, and the contribution of mass movement and water erosion to gully erosion based on fourteen scouring experiments on two field plots and terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). A three-dimensional (3D) method was proposed to derive the volume of gully erosion based on point clouds with topographic change information. The results showed that TLS-derived gully sediment yields were in a high agreement with the measured sediment yield (R-2 > 0.85, p < 0.01, and mean relative/absolute error < 11.38%/5.47 kg), which demonstrated the reliability of TLS and the newly proposed 3D volumetric calculation method in the gully erosion monitoring. We found that the development of gully erosion consisted of horizontal and vertical cycles. The horizontal development of gullies was dominated by a cycle of gully head retreat that was mainly driven by water erosion as well as gully head expansion that was considerably driven by collapses. The vertical development was driven by the co-evolution of collapses and caves that enhance the development of one another. Our experiments showed that mass movements were generally not a major source of gully erosion mass (1.09%-50.80%) or sediment yield (0.90%-24.71%), although they considerably contributed to the morphological development of gully heads (e.g. 26.74% to 96.09% of the increase in the maximum length of gully head and 39.03% to 94.80% of the change in gully head area). We also found that mass movements significantly impacted gully erosion mass (p < 0.05), while their relationships with sediment yield tended to be complex and depended on the impact of mass movements on the broader runoff and erosion processes. Besides, the extremely high collapses were also found to heavily impact the relationship between the collapse mass and the development of gully erosion, implying that further experiments are needed in the future to enrich the observations and thus improve the above-mentioned understanding. We conclude that by using TLS data in an experimental set-up, gully erosion processes can be captured with fine detail. This provides new insights into the process-understanding of gully erosion.

AB The deposits from volcanic eruptions represent the record of activity at a volcano. Identification, classification, and interpretation of these deposits are crucial to the understanding of volcanic processes and assessing hazards. However, deposits often cover large areas and can be difficult or dangerous to access, making field mapping hazardous and time-consuming. Remote sensing techniques are often used to map and identify the deposits of volcanic eruptions, though these techniques present their own trade-offs in terms of image resolution, wavelength, and observation frequency. Here, we present a new approach for mapping and classifying volcanic deposits using a multi-sensor unoccupied aerial system (UAS) and demonstrate its application on lava and tephra deposits associated with the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra volcano (Gal ' apagos Archipelago, Ecuador). We surveyed the study area and collected visible and thermal infrared (TIR) images. We used structure-from-motion photogrammetry to create a digital elevation model (DEM) from the visual images and calculated the solar heating rate of the surface from temperature maps based on the TIR images. We find that the solar heating rate is highest for tephra deposits and lowest for Modified Letter Turned CommaaModified Letter Turned Commaa over bar lava, with pa over bar hoehoe lava having intermediate values. This is consistent with the solar heating rate correlating to the density and particle size of the surface. The solar heating rate for the lava flow also decreases with increasing distance from the vent, consistent with an increase in density as the lava degasses. We combined the surface roughness (calculated from the DEM) and the solar heating rate of the surface to remotely classify tephra deposits and different lava morphologies. We applied both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. A supervised classification method can replicate the manual classification while the unsupervised method can identify major surface units with no ground truth information. These methods allow for remote mapping and classification at high spatial resolution (< 1 m) of a variety of volcanic deposits, with potential for application to deposits from other processes (e.g., fluvial, glacial) and deposits on other planetary bodies.

AB The measurement of leaf optical properties (LOP) using reflectance and scattering properties of light allows a continuous, time-resolved, and rapid characterization of many species traits including water status, chemical composition, and leaf structure. Variation in trait values expressed by individuals result from a combination of biological and environmental variations. Such species trait variations are increasingly recognized as drivers and responses of biodiversity and ecosystem properties. However, little has been done to comprehensively characterize or monitor such variation using leaf reflectance, where emphasis is more often on species average values. Furthermore, although a variety of platforms and protocols exist for the estimation of leaf reflectance, there is neither a standard method, nor a best practise of treating measurement uncertainty which has yet been collectively adopted. In this study, we investigate what level of uncertainty can be accepted when measuring leaf reflectance while ensuring the detection of species trait variation at several levels: within individuals, over time, between individuals, and between populations. As a study species, we use an economically and ecologically important dominant European tree species, namely Fagus sylvatica. We first use fabrics as standard material to quantify measurement uncertainties associated with leaf clip (0.0001 to 0.4 reflectance units) and integrating sphere measurements (0.0001 to 0.01 reflectance units) via error propagation. We then quantify spectrally resolved variation in reflectance from F. sylvatica leaves. We show that the measurement uncertainty associated with leaf reflectance, estimated using a field spectroradiometer with attached leaf clip, represents on average a small portion of the spectral variation within a single individual sampled over one growing season (2.7 +/- 1.7%), or between individuals sampled over one week (1.5 +/- 1.3% or 3.4 +/- 1.7%, respectively) in a set of monitored F. sylvatica trees located in Swiss and French forests. In all forests, the spectral variation between individuals exceeded the spectral variation of a single individual at the time of the measurement. However, measurements of variation within individuals at different canopy positions over time indicate that sampling design (e.g., standardized sampling, and sample size) strongly impacts our ability to measure between-individual variation. We suggest best practice approaches toward a standardized protocol to allow for rigorous quantification of species trait variation using leaf reflectance.

AB Assessing land-use following deforestation is vital for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. In this paper, for the first time, we assess the potential of spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal deep learning methods for large-scale classification of land-use following tropical deforestation using dense satellite time series over six years on the pan-tropical scale (incl. Latin America, Africa, and Asia). Based on an extensive reference database of six forest to land-use conversion types, we find that the spatio-temporal models achieved a substantially higher F1-score accuracies than models that account only for spatial or temporal patterns. Although all models performed better when the scope of the problem was limited to a single continent, the spatial models were more competitive than the temporal ones in this setting. These results suggest that the spatial patterns of land-use within a continent share more commonalities than the temporal patterns and the spatial patterns across continents. This work explores the feasibility of extending and complementing previous efforts for characterizing follow-up land-use after deforestation at a small-scale via human visual interpretation of high resolution RGB imagery. It supports the usage of fast and automated large-scale land-use classification and showcases the value of deep learning methods combined with spatio-temporal satellite data to effectively address the complex tasks of identifying land-use following deforestation in a scalable and cost effective manner.

AB The proxy for phytoplankton biomass, Chlorophyll a (Chl a), is an important variable to assess the health and state of the oceans which are under increasing anthropogenic pressures. Prior to the operational use of satellite ocean-colour Chl a to monitor the oceans, rigorous assessments of algorithm performance are necessary to select the most suitable products. Due to their inaccessibility, the oligotrophic open-ocean gyres are under-sampled and therefore under-represented in global in situ data sets. The Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) campaigns fill the sampling gap in Atlantic oligotrophic waters. In-water underway spectrophotometric data were collected on three AMT field campaigns in 2016, 2017 and 2018 to assess the performance of Sentinel-3A (S3-A) and Sentinel3B (S3-B) Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) products. Three Chl a algorithms for OLCI were compared: Processing baseline (pb) 2, which uses the ocean colour 4 band ratio algorithm (OC4Me); pb 3 (OL_L2M.003.00) which uses OC4Me and a colour index (CI); and POLYMER v4.8 which models atmosphere and water reflectance and retrieves Chl a as a part of its spectral matching inversion. The POLYMER Chl a for S-3A OLCI performed best. The S-3A OLCI pb 2 tended to under-estimate Chl a especially at low concentrations, while the updated OL_L2M.003.00 provided significant improvements at low concentrations. OLCI data were also compared to MODIS-Aqua (R2018 processing) and Suomi-NPP VIIRS standard products. MODIS-Aqua exhibited good performance similar to OLCI POLYMER whereas Suomi-NPP VIIRS exhibited a slight under-estimate at higher Chl a values. The reasons for the differences were that S-3A OLCI pb 2 Rrs were over-estimated at blue bands which caused the under-estimate in Chl a. There were also some artefacts in the Rrs spectral shape of VIIRS which caused Chl a to be under-estimated at values >0.1 mg m-3. In addition, using in situ Rrs to compute Chl a with OC4Me we found a bias of 25% for these waters, related to the implementation of the OC4ME algorithm for S-3A OLCI. By comparison, the updated OLCI processor OL_L2M.003.00 significantly improved the Chl a retrievals at lower concentrations corresponding to the AMT measurements. S-3A and S-3B OLCI Chl a products were also compared during the Sentinel-3 mission tandem phase (the period when S-3A and S-3B were flying 30 sec apart along the same orbit). Both S-3A and S-3B OLCI pb 2 under-estimated Chl a especially at low values and the trend was greater for S-3A compared to S-3B. The performance of OLCI was improved by using either OL_L2M.003.00 or POLYMER Chl a. Analysis of coincident satellite images for S-3A OLCI, MODIS-Aqua and VIIRS as composites and over large areas illustrated that OLCI POLYMER gave the highest Chl a concentrations and percentage (%) coverage over the north and south Atlantic gyres, and OLCI pb 2 produced the lowest Chl a and % coverage.

AB Tropical Montane Cloud Forests (TMCFs) form biodiverse communities that are characterized by frequent occurrence of low-level clouds from which they capture a substantial proportion of their precipitation - here referred to as occult precipitation. TMCFs provide important ecosystem services, in particular the supply of water to their wider surroundings. Throughout the tropics (here 23.5 degrees S to 23.5 degrees N), they are under pressure from deforestation and poor land management which leads to loss of both forest area and species diversity, and reduces their capture of occult precipitation. Climate change may also reduce occult precipitation in TMCFs since the cloud base may lift in response to higher temperatures - the 'lifting cloud-base hypothesis'. These threats to TMCFs are well understood, but their quantitative assessment is hampered by 1) uncertainty in the location and spatial extent of TMCFs and 2) limited availability of representative meteorological data. We use a Random Forest Classifier - informed by topographic data, MODIS vegetation data, TRMM precipitation data and ERA5-Land and MERRA-2 reanalysis products - to estimate the spatial distribution and extent of TMCFs (2.1 x 10(6) km(2) +/- 0.5 x 10(6) km(2)). We analyze temporal changes in climate, tree-cover and greenness of TMCFs over the past two to four decades to detect 1) multi-decadal trends, and 2) associations with the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Evidence for the 'lifting cloud-base hypothesis' in reanalysis products was inconsistent across the tropics; a lifting of the cloud base during the past four decades occurred for about 20% of TMCFs, predominantly in the Americas and a few locations in Africa, while in Asia a downward movement of the cloud base was found. However, these results in part depend on the bias correction applied to the reanalyses. Changes in TMCF tree cover and greenness varied by continent; in Africa in 50% of TMCFs tree cover declined, whereas TMCFs in the Americas and in Asia exhibited a net increase in tree cover, despite a reduction in tree cover in similar to 20% of these TMCFs. An important limitation of the tree-cover data is that they do not distinguish between natural tree cover and agro-forestry. ENSO signals were more strongly present in precipitation in American and Asian TMCFs, whereas IOD signals were stronger in TMCF temperature and dewpoint temperature across the tropics. ENSO and IOD signals were approximately equally important for precipitation in African TMCFs and in cloud-base height across the tropics. An arbitrary warming of 1 degrees C and a 100 m lifting of the cloud base, in accordance with the 'lifting cloud hypothesis', imposed on the Random Forest classifier showed a decline in the extent of TMCFs in the Americas and Africa, but an increase in Asia - mostly at the expense of evergreen broadleaf forests. The greater vulnerability of TMCFs in Africa may be linked to their more isolated and scattered distribution across the continent and drier conditions compared to a more continuous distribution and wetter conditions in the Americas and Asia.

AB Assessing a map's accuracy and efficacy requires careful consideration and calculation of a comprehensive set of measures, particularly when characteristics in geospatial datasets may be used for addressing multiple objectives. We describe a map accuracy assessment framework for categorical geospatial data over large areas that utilizes site-specific (plot-pixel), non-site specific (area estimates), and comparative accuracy (spatial and statistical distributions) methods. This comprehensive framework spans the range of approaches applied in most other studies, maximizing opportunities for both within- and between-study comparisons. The analysis framework incorporated recommended good practices for sampling design, response design, analysis protocols, and designbased inference for providing rigorous estimates of accuracy and precision. Further partitioning of disagreement allows users to assess the relative importance of spatial location versus total abundance of map classes to map error; we introduced a ratio of allocation disagreement to quantity disagreement for comparing relative importance of each across datasets. Assessment of fuzzy membership with linguistic scales may have minimal effect on overall accuracy, but can provide substantial improvement in user's accuracy and producer's accuracy for uncommon classes. We adapted non-site specific approaches to provide metrics and insights into spatial variability of map accuracy of thematic classes. Comparing estimates based on reference data and co-located samples of map data may reveal potential issues with reference data. We demonstrated example applications all components of the assessment framework for thematic maps of early successional forest and other land cover classes across the western Great Lakes region, USA.

AB Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) estimation and monitoring based on high spatial resolution remote sensing information such as obtained with an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is of significant interest for field-scale precision irrigation management, particularly in water-limited regions of the world. To date, there is no accurate and widely accepted model that relies on UAS optical surface reflectance observations for RZSM estimation at high spatial resolution. This study is aimed at the development of a new approach for RZSM estimation based on the fusion of high spatial resolution optical reflectance UAS observations with physical and hydraulic soil information integrated into Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). The H2O AutoML platform includes a number of advanced machine learning algorithms that efficiently perform feature selection and automatically identify complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Twelve models combining UAS optical observations with various soil properties were developed in a hierarchical manner and fed into AutoML to estimate surface, near-surface, and root zone soil moisture. The addition of independently measured surface and near-surface soil moisture information to the hierarchical models to improve RZSM estimation was investigated. The accuracy of soil moisture estimates was evaluated based on a comparison with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors that were deployed to monitor surface, near-surface and root zone soil moisture dynamics. The obtained results indicate that the consideration of physical and hydraulic soil properties together with UAS optical observations improves soil moisture estimation, especially for the root zone with a RMSE of about 0.04 cm3 cm-3. Accurate RZSM estimates were obtained when measured surface and near-surface soil moisture data was added to the hierarchical models, yielding RMSE values below 0.02 cm3 cm-3 and R and NSE values above 0.90. The generated high spatial resolution RZSM maps clearly capture the spatial variability of soil moisture at the field scale. The presented framework can aid farm scale precision irrigation management via improving the crop water use efficiency and reducing the risk of groundwater contamination.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been widely cited as a proxy for photosynthesis and is being incorporated as a common input in terrestrial primary productivity models. Though satellite-based SIF products show close relationships with terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP), there is wide variability in the magnitude of published SIF retrievals made at intermediate scales. In a meta-analysis of the tower-based and airborne SIF literature, we found that mean SIF retrievals from unstressed vegetation spanned a wide range, from 0.041 mW m- 2 nm- 1 sr-1 to 14.8 mW m- 2 nm- 1 sr-1, with a majority of values falling below 4 mW m- 2 nm- 1 sr-1. We compiled information on reported spectrometer calibration procedures, hardware characterizations, and associated corrections from these same papers, and found inconsistent reporting on if and how key calibration methodology was performed. In order to quantify the importance of such methodological differences on final SIF retrievals made at a proximal scale, we performed radiometric calibrations and corrections for electronic dark current, detector noise, atmospheric O2 absorbance, and cosine corrector effects on three field-deployed spectrometers. We found dramatic changes in SIF retrieval magnitude before and after applying calibrations and corrections, as well as significant differences between instrument performance in the field and expected performance based on laboratory characterizations. Based on these tests, and on a Monte Carlo simulation of uncertainty estimates associated with each of these corrections, it is likely that calibration methodologies and hardware characterizations explain some of the observed variability in published SIF retrievals. This wide range in baseline SIF retrieval methodologies and resultant magnitudes severely limit researchers? ability to synthesize and advance the utility of SIF in modeling GPP across scales. Further, variability in calibration and correction methodology may explain the weak SIF-GPP relationship across studies at tower scales.

AB Absorption of radiation in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) region is significantly influenced by plant biochemistry, structural properties, and photosynthetic pathway. To understand and quantify the effects of these traits on absorbed PAR it is necessary to develop practical and reliable tools that are sensitive to these traits. Using a semi-analytical modeling framework for deriving the absorption coefficient of plant canopies from reflectance spectra, we quantify the effects of functional, structural and biochemical traits of vegetation on the relationship between the absorption coefficient in the PAR region (?par) with canopy characteristics such as the fraction of PAR absorbed by photosynthetically active vegetation (fAPARgreen) and chlorophyll (Chl) content. The reflectance dataset used in the study included simulated data obtained from a canopy reflectance model (PROSAIL) and empirical data on three diverse crop species with different leaf structures, canopy architectures and photosynthetic pathways (rice, maize and soybean) acquired at proximal (i.e., using field spectroradiometers) and remote (i.e., Landsat TM and ETM+) distances. Results show the usefulness of ?par derived from reflectance data for assessing not only the photosynthetic status of vegetation, but also the effects of different functional, structural and biochemical traits on plant performance. Furthermore, these assessments can be made using data acquired by satellite sensor systems such as the Landsat series, which are available since the 1980s, thus facilitating the analysis of the photosynthetic status of terrestrial ecosystems throughout the world with a high temporal depth.

AB Atmospheric aerosols play key roles in radiation budget, ecosystem dynamics, air quality and cloud microphysics of a region and thus, they greatly influence the global climate, ecosystem and public health. We present the temporal variability of atmospheric aerosols over India and north Indian Ocean (NIO) for the past two decades (2000?2019). Here, the measurements from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra, Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) on Terra, and Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) measurements from Envisat, and Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis data are considered. On average, the Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP) shows the largest (0.5?1.2), and NIO and Himalaya show the smallest (0.1 or smaller) Aerosol Optical depth (AOD) values. The peak AOD loading is observed in June?July-August, and IGP has a secondary peak in March owing to the stubble and biomass burning in winter months. In contrast, the peak aerosol loading in the northeast is in winter due to forest and biomass burning during the period there. The inter-annual variability is very small in NIO, Himalaya and Bay of Bengal. The trends estimated from the combined (AATSR, MISR, MODIS and MERRA-2) data show the highest positive trends at the lower IGP and east central regions, about 0.8?1.2/dec, and are statistically significant. This is consistent with the urban activity, industries and dense population there. However, the Desert, northern Himalaya and northern Arabian Sea show insignificant negative trends, from-0.2 to-0.4/dec, as the anthropogenic sources of aerosols are very limited there. The bias estimate shows that most satellite and reanalysis data are in very good agreement at all regions (within 0.1?0.2). Even though the bias in the measurements are considered, the trends estimated are still large enough to be statistically significant. The analyses, therefore, caution the increasing aerosol loading and their plausible climate feedback in these regions. The assessment also demonstrate the potential of synergetic use of multiple-platform measurements for climate system studies.

AB We introduce a new platform, Ocean Color - Simultaneous Marine and Aerosol Retrieval Tool (OC-SMART), for analysis of data obtained by satellite ocean color sensors. OC-SMART is a multi-sensor data analysis platform which supports heritage, current, and possible future multi-spectral and hyper-spectral sensors from US, EU, Korea, Japan, and China, including SeaWiFS, Aqua/MODIS, SNPP/VIIRS, ISS/HICO, Landsat8/OLI, DSCOVR/EPIC, Sentinel-2/MSI, Sentinel-3/OLCI, COMS/GOCI, GCOM-C/SGLI and FengYun-3D/MERSI2. The products provided by OC-SMART include spectral normalized remote sensing reflectances (R-rs values), chlorophyll_a (CHL) concentrations, and spectral in-water inherent optical properties (IOPs) including absorption coefficients due to phytoplankton (a(ph)), absorption coefficients due to detritus and Gelbstoff (a(dg)) and backscattering coefficients due to particulates (b(bp)). Spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) and cloud mask results are also provided by OC-SMART.
   The goal of OC-SMART is to improve the quality of global ocean color products retrieved from satellite sensors, especially under complex environmental conditions, such as coastal/inland turbid water areas and heavy aerosol loadings. Therefore, the atmospheric correction (AC) and ocean IOP algorithms in OC-SMART are driven by extensive radiative transfer (RT) simulations in conjunction with powerful machine learning techniques. To simulate top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances, we solve the radiative transfer equation pertinent for the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. For each sensor, we have created about 13 million RT simulations and comprehensive training datasets to support the development of the machine learning AC and in-water IOP algorithms. The results, as demonstrated in this paper, are very promising. Not only does OC-SMART improve the quality of the retrieved water products, it also resolves the negative water-leaving radiance problem that has plagued heritage AC algorithms. The comprehensive training datasets created using multiple atmosphere, aerosol, and ocean IOP models ensure global and generic applicability of OC-SMART.
   The use of machine learning algorithms makes OC-SMART roughly 10 times faster than NASA's SeaDAS platform. OC-SMART also includes an advanced cloud screening algorithm and is resilient to the contamination by weak to moderate sunglint and cloud edges. It is therefore capable of recovering large amounts of data that are discarded by other algorithms (such as those implemented in NASA's SeaDAS package), especially in coastal areas. OC-SMART is currently available as a standalone Python package or as a plugin that can be installed in ESA's Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP).

AB The European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus [L.]) is one of the most damaging pest insects of European spruce forests. A crucial measure in pest control is the removal of infested trees before the beetles leave the bark, which generally happens before the end of June. However, stressed tree crowns do not show any significant color changes in the visible spectrum at this early-stage of infestation, making early detection difficult. In order to detect the related forest stress at an early stage, we investigated the differences in radar and spectral signals of healthy and stressed trees. How the characteristics of stressed trees changed over time was analyzed for the whole vegetation season, which covered the period before attacks (April), early-stage infestation ('green-attacks', May to July), and middle to late-stage infestation (August to October). The results show that spectral differences already existed at the beginning of the vegetation season, before the attacks. The spectral separability between the healthy and infested samples did not change significantly during the 'green-attack' stage. The results indicate that the trees were stressed before the attacks and had spectral signatures that differed from healthy ones. These stress-induced spectral changes could be more efficient indicators of early infestations than the 'green-attack' symptoms.
   In this study we used Sentinel-1 and 2 images of a test site in southern Sweden from April to October in 2018 and 2019. The red and SWIR bands from Sentinel-2 showed the highest separability of healthy and stressed samples. The backscatter from Sentinel-1 and additional bands from Sentinel-2 contributed only slightly in the Random Forest classification models. We therefore propose the Normalized Distance Red & SWIR (NDRS) index as a new index based on our observations and the linear relationship between the red and SWIR bands. This index identified stressed forest with accuracies from 0.80 to 0.88 before the attacks, from 0.80 to 0.82 in the early-stage infestation, and from 0.81 to 0.91 in middle- and late-stage infestations. These accuracies are higher than those attained by established vegetation indices aimed at 'green-attack' detection, such as the Normalized Difference Water Index, Ratio Drought Index, and Disease Stress Water Index. By using the proposed method, we highlight the potential of using NDRS with Sentinel-2 images to estimate forest vulnerability to European spruce bark beetle attacks early in the vegetation season.

TI Estimating three-dimensional coseismic deformations with the SM-VCE

   Deformation dilution of precision; Accuracy comparison
AB The previously proposed Strain Model and Variance Component Estimation (SM-VCE) method estimates three-dimensional (3-D) deformations based on heterogeneous synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations from three or more distinct observing geometries. This method establishes an observation function by exploiting the spatial correlation of adjacent point deformations based on a geo-kinematic model (i.e., SM), and it determines an accurate weight of heterogeneous observations using the VCE algorithm; this method has been demonstrated to be superior to the traditional pixel-by-pixel-based weighted least square (WLS) method. However, since the SM-VCE method employs the adjacent points' observations to estimate 3-D deformations at a target point, it is inevitable that it results in a bias in the solution near the deformation jump area (e.g., the fault zone in an earthquake). In this paper, a Strain Model-based Adaptive Neighborhood Determining (SMAD) method is proposed to identify homogeneous deformation observations in such a way that the accuracy of the 3-D deformations estimated by the SM-VCE method can be increased, especially near the surface rupture area. This method is used for mapping 3-D coseismic deformations associated with the 2016 Mw7.8 KaikOura earthquake in New Zealand. Furthermore, with increasing SAR data available for a single event, the effect of the number/type of independent observations on the accuracy of the 3-D deformations remains poorly understood and requires further discussion. To accomplish this goal, we define a term, the deformation dilution of precision (DDOP), to represent the quality of the 3-D deformation vector; this term is similar to the position dilution of precision (PDOP) in global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and we investigate different combinations with different numbers/types of independent observations to explore the 3-D deformations of this earthquake. The results demonstrate that the type of incorporated observations can significantly dominate the accuracy of the 3-D deformations compared to the number of observations, which can provide an important reference for relevant studies that estimate 3-D deformations. Furthermore, the proposed methods and conclusions are beneficial for estimating 3-D surface deformations associated with other geophysical processes, such as volcanic eruptions.

AB Radiometric measurements in the Thermal Infrared (TIR) domain exhibit an angular variation over most surface types, known as the Thermal Radiation Directionality (TRD) phenomenon. A primary objective of the ongoing development of TRD physical models is to perform a correction of the angular effects to obtain comparable land surface temperature products. In practice, it is advised to handle only the models having a limited number of input parameters for the purpose of operational applications. The use of semi-empirical kernel-driven models (KDMs) appears to be a good tradeoff between physical accuracy and computational efficiency as it was already demonstrated through a broad usage in the optical domain. It remains that the existing state-of-the-art 3 -parameter TIR KDMs (RossThick-LiSparseR, LiStrahlerFriedl-LiDenseR, Vinnikov, and RoujeanLagouarde) underestimate the hotspot phenomenon, especially for continuous canopies marked by a narrow peak. In this study, a new general framework of TIR kernel-driven modeling is proposed to overcome such issue. It is a linear combination of three kernels (including a base shape kernel, a hotspot kernel with adjustable width and an isotropic kernel) with the ability to simulate the bowl, dome and bell shapes in the solar principal plane. Four specific 4-parameter models (Vinnikov-RoujeanLagouarde, LiStrahlerFriedl-RoujeanLagouarde, Vinnikov-Chen, and LiStrahlerFriedlChen, named "base shape kernel hotspot kernel") within the new framework were studied to assess their abilities to mimic the patterns of the directional brightness temperature for both continuous and discrete vegetation canopies. These four 4-parameter KDMs and four 3-parameter KDMs were comprehensively evaluated with 306 groups of simulated multi-angle datasets generated by a modernized analytical 4-stream radiative transfer model based on the Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (4SAIL), and a Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model considering different solar zenith angles (SZA), canopy architectures and component temperatures, and 2 groups of airborne measured multi-angle datasets over continuous maize and discrete pine forest. Results show that the four 4-parameter KDMs behave better than the four existing 3 -parameter KDMs over continuous canopies (e.g. R-2 increases from 0.661 similar to 0.970 to 0.940 similar to 0.997 and RMSE decreases from 0.17 similar to 0.71 to 0.07 similar to 0.16 when SZA = 30 degrees) and discrete canopies (e.g. R-2 increases from 0.791 similar to 0.989 to 0.976 similar to 0.996 and RMSE decreases from 0.10 similar to 0.84 to 0.08 similar to 0.21 when SZA = 30 degrees). The new general framework with four parameters (three kernel coefficients and an adjustable hotspot width) improves the fitting ability significantly, compared to the four existing three-parameter KDMs, given the addition of one more degree of freedom. Results show that the coefficients of the base shape kernel, hotspot kernel and isotropic kernel are related to the temperature difference between leaf and background, temperature difference between sunlit component and shaded component, and the nadir brightness temperature, respectively. However, the estimated hotspot width depends on vegetation structure. The new kernel-driven modeling framework has the potential to be a tool for angular correction of multi-angle satellite observations and angular optimization of future multi angle TIR sensors.

AB In this research, a new drought monitoring approach with an adaptive index-Vector Projection Analysis (VPA) and Vector Projection Index of Drought (VPID)- was developed that considers multiple drought indicators in various climate zones across the Contiguous United States (CONUS) and East Asia. A major advantage of VPA is that it uses multiple dependent variables (i.e., surface-based drought indices) and multiple independent variables (i.e., satellite-derived drought factors) to capture varied climate and environmental characteristics. Therefore, the VPA-based indices can be adopted for different drought types (i.e., meteorological, agricultural and hydrological droughts) depending on the user's selection of drought factors and indices. In VPA, the weights of each drought factor are generated through correlations (r) between each dependent variable and a satellite-derived drought factor that is obtained from the new generation sensor systems, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM). Three schemes of VPID with different combinations of variables focused on integrated-, short-, and long-term drought (VPIDinte, VPIDshort, and VPIDlong, respectively) were evaluated over the CONUS and East Asia. All three schemes showed good agreement with surface-based drought indices resulting in averaged r (from 0.42 to 0.68) across both study areas. While VPIDshort or VPIDlong were more correlated with short (1-3 months) or long (9-12 months) term surface-based drought indices, VPIDinte provided a more generalized (i.e., integrated from 1 to 12 months) index that is suitable for varied drought conditions. The spatial distributions of drought from VPIDs agreed with United States Drought Monitor (USDM) data and Emergency Events Database across East Asia for both extreme drought and normal conditions. In particular, the drought areas of VPIDinte corresponded with the USDM results with r = 0.83 and root mean square error = 9.4%. Crop yield trends were also consistent with the VPIDs results in most years for both study areas. The proposed approach, VPA and VPID, can be adopted for any region with different combinations of surface-based drought indices and satellite-derived drought factors.

AB The cloud-base temperature (CBT) is one of the parameters that dominates the cloudy sky surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR). However, CBT is rarely available at regional and global scales, and its application in estimating cloud sky SDLR is limited. In this study, a framework to globally estimate cloud sky SDLR during both daytime and nighttime is proposed. This framework is composed of three parts. First, a global cloudy property database was constructed by combing the extracted cloud vertical structure (CVS) parameters from the active CloudSat data and cloud properties from passive MODIS data. Second, the empirical methods for estimating cloud thickness (CT) under ISCCP cloud classification system and MODIS cloud classification system were developed. Additionally, the coefficients of CERES CT estimate models were refitted using the constructed cloud property database. With the estimated CT and reanalysis data, calculating the CBT is straightforward. The accuracy of the estimated CT for ISCCP cloud type is compared with the existing studies that were conducted at local scales. Our CT estimate accuracy is comparable to that of the existing studies. According to the validation results at ARM NSA and SGP stations, the CT estimated by the developed CT model for MODIS cloud type is better than that estimated by the original CERES CT model. Finally, the cloudy sky SDLR values were derived by feeding the estimated CBT and other parameters to the single-layer cloud model (SLCM). When validated by the ground measured SDLR collected from the SURFRAD network, the bias and RMSE are 5.42 W.m(-2) and 30.3 W.m(-2), respectively. This accuracy is comparable to the evaluation results of the mainstream SDLR products (Gui et al. 2010), the new evaluation results of SLCMs (Yu et al. 2018), and the accuracy of a new cloudy sky SDLR estimate method (Wang et al. 2018). All the derived CBTs improve the SDLR estimate accuracy more than the SLCM that directly uses cloud-top temperature (CTT). We will collect more ground measurements and continue to validate the developed framework in the future.

AB The next generation of spaceborne imaging spectrometers will enable hyperspectral analysis of vegetation cover across large spatial extents. Spectral unmixing provides a means to assess subpixel vegetation composition in such imagery. Here we implement a regression-based unmixing approach to generate fractional vegetation cover on a regional scale from a simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite scene derived from Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery acquired over the San Francisco Bay Area, California, USA, an area with a mixture of temperate and Mediterranean climate forests, woodlands and shrublands. A hierarchical classification scheme was implemented that considered fractional cover of vegetation as a whole (vegetation vs non-vegetation), vegetation life forms (woody vs non-woody vegetation; tree vs shrub vs grass), and tree leaf type (needleleaf vs broadleaf). A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model was trained using synthetically-mixed training data generated from an endmember library, and mapping accuracy was assessed using an independent validation dataset across four ecoregions. Our approach was able to effectively model landscape patterns at all levels of the class hierarchy. Site-wide map accuracy was highest when mapping generic vegetation fractions (MAE = 3.8%) and expectedly decreased at more complex hierarchy levels, with highest errors observed when separating tree and shrub fractions. Still, fraction estimates of needleleaf trees (MAE = 10.6%), broadleaf trees (MAE = 13.1%) and shrubs (MAE = 15.3%) were mapped with low overall error. Using Landsat imagery led to an average decrease in map accuracy of 1.9% when compared to hyperspectral image analysis and a maximum decrease of 3.5% when separating broadleaf and needleleaf trees across all sites. Further, a single regional model was shown to yield comparable results to multiple local ecoregion-based models, facilitating the analysis of large regions without creating a separate model for each region. Our results highlight the utility of regression-based approaches for quantitative vegetation mapping, which is of particular interest for future spaceborne imaging spectroscopy missions operating across large areas at moderate spatial resolution.

AB Realistic representations and simulation of mass and energy exchanges across heterogeneous landscapes can be a challenge in land surface and dynamic vegetation models. For mixed life-form biomes such as savannas, plant function is very difficult to parameterise due to the distinct physiological characteristics of tree and grass plant functional types (PFTs) that vary dramatically across space and time. The partitioning of their fractional contributions to ecosystem gross primary production (GPP) remains to be achieved at regional scale using remote sensing. The objective of this study was to partition savanna gross primary production (GPP) into tree and grass functional components based on their distinctive phenological characteristics. Comparison of the remote sensing partitioned GPP(tree) and GPP(grass) against field measurements from eddy covariance (EC) towers showed an overall good agreement in terms of both GPP seasonality and magnitude. We found total GPP, as well as its tree and grass components, decreased dramatically with rainfall over the North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT), from the Eucalyptus forest and woodland in the northern humid coast to the grasslands, Acacia woodlands and shrublands in the southern xeric interior. Spatially, GPP(tree) showed a steeper decrease with precipitation along the NATT compared to GPP(grass), thus tree/grass GPP ratios also decreased from the northern mesic region to the arid south region of the NATT. However, results also showed a second trend at the southern part of the transect, where tree-grass ratios and total GPP increased with decreasing mean annual precipitation, and this occurred in the physiognomic transition from hummock grasslands to Acacia woodland savannas. Total GPP and tree-grass GPP ratios across climate extremes were found to be primarily driven by grass layer response to rainfall dynamics. The grass-containing xeric savannas exhibited a higher hydroclimatic sensitivity, whereas GPP in the northern mesic savannas was fairly stable across years despite large variations in rainfall amount. The pronounced spatiotemporal variations in savanna vegetation productivity encountered along the NATT study area suggests that the savanna biome is particularly sensitive and vulnerable to predicted future climate change and hydroclimatic variability.

AB This paper presents a community effort to develop good practice guidelines for the validation of global coarse-scale satellite soil moisture products. We provide theoretical background, a review of state-of-the-art methodologies for estimating errors in soil moisture data sets, practical recommendations on data pre-processing and presentation of statistical results, and a recommended validation protocol that is supplemented with an example validation exercise focused on microwave-based surface soil moisture products. We conclude by identifying research gaps that should be addressed in the near future.

AB Characterisation of the ecosystem functioning of mudflats requires insight on the morphology and facies of these coastal features, but also on biological processes that influence mudflat geomorphology, such as crab bioturbation and the formation of benthic biofilms, as well as their heterogeneity at cm or less scales. Insight into this fine scale of ecosystem functioning is also important as far as minimizing errors in upscaling are concerned. The realisation of high-resolution ground surveys of these mudflats without perturbing their surface is a real challenge. Here, we address this challenge using UAV-supported photogrammetry based on the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) workflow. We produced a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophotograph at 1 cm and 0.5 cm pixel resolutions, respectively, of a mudflat in French Guiana, and mapped and classed into different size ranges intricate morphological features, including crab burrow apertures, tidal drainage creeks and depressions. We also determined subtle facies and elevation changes and slopes, and the footprint of different degrees of benthic biofilm development. The results generated at this scale of photogrammetric analysis also enabled us to relate macrofaunal crab burrowing activity to various parameters, including mudflat elevation, spatial distribution and sizes of creeks and depressions, benthic biofilm distribution, and flooding duration. SfM photogrammetry offers interesting new perspectives in fine-scale characterisation of the geomorphology, benthic activity and degree of biofilm development of dynamic muddy intertidal environments that are generally difficult of access. The main shortcomings highlighted in this study are a drift of accuracy of the DSM outside areas of ground control points and the deployment of which perturb the mudflat morphology and biology, the water-logged or very wet surfaces which generate reconstruction artefacts through the sun glint effect, and the time-consuming task of manual interpretation of extraction of features such as crab burrow apertures. On-going developments in UAV positioning integrating RTK/PPK GPS solutions for image-georeferencing and precise orientation with high-quality inertial measurement units will limit the difficulties inherent to ground control points, while conduction of surveys during homogeneous cloudy conditions could reduce the sun-glint effect. Manual extraction of image features could be automated in the future through the use of deep-learning algorithms.

AB The development of fractional vegetation cover products for Australia that resolve cover into photosynthetic vegetation (F-PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (F-NPV) and bare soil/rock (F-BS) provides a new basis for examination of responses of vegetation cover to long term precipitation cycles, and to explore the interaction between these responses and land cover type, land use and other land surface properties. In this study, the relationship between accumulated antecedent precipitation (AAP) from 1 to 60 months and average monthly F-PV and F-NPV from the MODIS Fractional Cover Product is examined over a 17 year period from 2001 to 2018. The maximum R-2 value, regression coefficients for the maximum R-2, and number of accumulated months to the maximum R-2 were mapped for each month of the year for F-PV and F-NPV. Behaviour of responses in relation to land use, land cover, and soil water holding capacity was analysed based on pixel frequencies of classes at sub-region scale in the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia. The analysis showed that F-PV is largely dependent upon AAP in the preceding 12 months, however responses to longer periods of AAP also occur in specific land use-vegetation type combinations. The study also showed that positive responses in F-NPV could be driven by AAP from as much as 60 months, but that F-NPV is reduced in many areas in response to increased AAP. The presence or absence of domesticated livestock grazing as defined by Australian land use mapping was a major influence on response to AAP of both F-PV and F-NPV with statistical analysis indicating interactions between major natural vegetation type and grazing. In highly responsive areas (R-2 > 0.6) monitoring of land condition could be enhanced by testing of regional cover levels for major deviations from the long terms responses that might suggest land management concerns.

AB The Landsat 5 orbit changed more than expected over its three-decade mission life. Previous modelling research indicated that the resulting Landsat 5 overpass time and so acquisition solar zenith differences will have caused non-negligible reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) temporal differences. Rather than use a modelling approach this paper presents the results of a comprehensive examination of the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Ten years of summer Landsat 5 TM Analysis Ready Data (ARD) sampled at >19.3 million 30 m pixel locations across the conterminous United States (CONUS) are considered. The acquisition solar zenith, red, near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR) (similar to 2.1 mu m) surface reflectance, and NDVI, are compared between five consecutive periods (1995 versus 2006, 1996 versus 2007, 1997 versus 2008, 1998 versus 2009, and 1999 versus 2010) that span years with very different Landsat 5 overpass times, and are also compared between 1998 and 1999 that have similar overpass times. The different years of Landsat 5 TM data are plotted against each other and reduced major axis (RMA) regressions passing though the origin are developed and compared with the acquisition solar geometry changes. The red, SWIR and NDVI RMA slopes are proportional to the magnitude of solar zenith change between years and are indicative of CONUS-wide differences due to orbit drift. The greatest differences occurred between 1995 and 2006, the years with the greatest solar zenith differences (median CONUS difference 8.43 degrees) with RMA regression slopes quite far from unity (1.14 for the red and SWIR bands, 0.91 for NDVI). In years with smaller solar zenith differences the RMA slopes are closer to unity. As agricultural crops may be managed inconsistently through time, and as drought may have pronounced effects on reflectance, the analysis is also undertaken masking out crop pixels and considering locations that have similar precipitation and evapotranspiration conditions between years. These experiments indicate that, at CONUS scale, the cause of the changing RMA regression slopes between years is not due to agricultural changes or to the influence of above normal drought or wetness. The results confirm previous published modelling based findings but are based on direct examination of CONUS Landsat 5 TM data. They indicate that certain research and applications that require temporally consistent red, SWIR and NDVI data may need to take Landsat 5 orbit drift effects into account.

AB To better eliminate the adverse effects of the ground surface on winter wheat Leaf area index (LAI) inversions and to further improve the accuracy of regional winter wheat LAI inversion using SAR remote sensing data, considering the morphological characteristics at different wheat growth stages, a winter wheat LAI inversion model coupled with the microwave scattering model (MSM) for winter wheat at different growth stages (MSMDGS) and the canopy scattering simulation model (CSSM) was proposed. In this research, taking Hengshui City of Huanghuaihai Plain of North China as the study region, using RADARSAT-2 data as image sources and based on parameter sensitivity analysis and model calibration, the proposed model was applied and validated. The LAI inversion results of winter wheat showed that the proposed model had good performance in the regional application and that LAI inversion results with high accuracy could be obtained. Among the three key growth stages (jointing stage, booting stage and heading stage) of winter wheat, the R-2, adjusted R-2 and RMSE between the LAI inversion value and the ground-measured data were 0.918, 0.917 and 0.675, respectively, which indicated that the winter wheat LAI inversion model coupled with MSMDGS and CSSM had certain feasibility and applicability.

AB Dramatic phenological shifts and ecosystem responses of deciduous forests to global climate change have been reported around the world. Land Surface Phenology (LSP) derived from satellite imagery is useful to estimate the phenological responses of vegetation to climate variability and inform terrestrial ecosystem models at landscape to global scales. However, there is a large (and unquantified) uncertainty in estimated phenological dates due to the relatively coarse temporal resolution of typical data and methodological limitations. To assess responses of phenology and related ecological function and services, it is essential to decrease the temporal uncertainty of estimated phenological processes. In this study, we developed a new LSP estimation method using linear change point models to determine four phenological transitions using twice-daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from 2000 to 2015. We evaluated the approach using long-term phenological ground observations and compare performance of four LSP estimations generated from two data sources (i.e. 8-day and twice daily EVI time series) and two methods (i.e. double logistic and change point estimation). We found that the LSP generated from change point estimation with twice daily EVI time series had the highest accuracy (i.e. lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), mean bias, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)) for both spring and fall phenology evaluated by Harvard Forest phenology observations and a large citizen science database of phenological observations from the National Phenology Network. For example, change point estimation reduced the estimation error for fall senescence date from over 40 days in the standard MODIS phenology product (version 005) to 11.5-24 days of RMSE, -2.6 to -5.8 days of mean bias, and 7.9-20.1 days of MAE. The change point methodology also enables calculation of additional metrics to describe the biophysical process of vegetation, including rates of greenup, green-down, and senescence, EVI values at each phenological transition, and the estimation uncertainties for each transition date. Our LSP estimations will improve more comprehensive investigations of landscape phenology of deciduous forest and the associated ecosystem processes at regional to global scales.

AB The Landsat program, since its commencement in 1972, has acquired millions of images of our planet. Those images are one of the most valuable Earth Observation resources for local, regional and global land surface monitoring and study due to their moderate spatial resolution and rich spectral information. However, their applications are impeded largely by their relatively low revisit frequency and cloud contamination on images. In order to improve their usability, a number of studies have been conducted to blend Landsat images with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to take merits of the two sensors. All blending models reported that they can predict synthetic Landsat images with various degrees of accuracy. However, only a couple of models reported that they can explicitly estimate uncertainty for their blended images.
   In this study, we propose a new surface reflectance blending model based on a Kalman Filter algorithm (Kalman Filter Reflectance Fusion Model - KFRFM) to predict time-series synthetic Landsat images from Landsat and MODIS images, and simultaneously to estimate uncertainty of the predicted synthetic images to quantify the quality of the synthetic images. Using the model, we predicted a time-series of 38 synthetic Landsat images with a temporal interval of 4 days for a vegetation growing season spanning about 6 months from Nadir Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function adjusted MODIS product (MCD43A4), and their corresponding uncertainties. From this time-series, we calculated five vegetation indices involving all the spectral bands of the synthetic images, and compared them to those from Landsat observations. The results demonstrated that the proposed method is able to produce high quality synthetic Landsat images to meet various application demands for higher spatial and temporal resolution images. Uncertainty analysis reveals that cropland has the largest uncertainty followed by grassland while forests have the smallest uncertainties among the seven vegetation land cover types of the study area. For performance evaluation, we compared KFRFM to several published models. The comparison results reveal that KFRFM performs the best based on the assessed image quality indices.

AB The REDD+ mechanism of UNFCCC was established to reduce greenhouse gases emissions by means of financial incentives. Of importance to the success of REDD+ and similar initiatives is the provision of credible evidence of reductions in the extent of land change activities that release carbon to the atmosphere (e.g. deforestation). The criteria for reporting land change areas and associated emissions within REDD+ stipulate the use of sampling-based approaches, which allow for unbiased estimation and uncertainty quantification. But for economic compensation for emission reductions to be feasible, agreements between participating countries and donors often require reporting every year or every second year. With the rates of land change typically being very small relative to the total study area, sampling-based approaches for estimation of annual or bi-annual areas have proven problematic, especially when comparing area estimates over time. In this paper, we present a methodology for monitoring and estimating areas of land change activity at high temporal resolution that is compliant with international guidelines. The methodology is based on a break detection algorithm applied to time series of Landsat data in the Colombian Amazon between 2001 and 2016. A biennial stratified sampling approach was implemented to (1) remove the bias introduced by the change detection and classification algorithm in mapped areas derived from pixel-counting; and (2) provide confidence intervals for area estimates obtained from the reference data collected for the sample. Our results show that estimating the area of land change, like deforestation, at annual or bi-annual resolution is inherently challenging and associated with high degrees of uncertainty. We found that better precision was achieved if independent sample datasets of reference observations were collected for each time interval for which area estimates are required. The alternative of selecting one sample of continuous reference observations analyzed for inference of area for each time interval did not yield area estimates significantly different from zero. Also, when large stable land covers (primary forest in this case, occupying almost 90% of the study area) are present in the study area in combination with small rates of land change activity, the impact of omission errors in the map used for stratifying the study area will be substantial and potentially detrimental to usefulness of land change studies. The introduction of a buffer stratum around areas of mapped land change reduced the uncertainty in area estimates by up to 98%. Results indicate that the Colombian Amazon has experienced a small but steady decrease in primary forest due to establishment of pastures, with forest-to-pasture conversion reaching 103 +/- 30 kha (95% confidence interval) in the period between 2013 and 2015, corresponding to 0.22% of the study area. Around 29 +/- 17 kha (95% CI) of pastureland that had been abandoned shortly after establishment reverted to secondary forest within the same period. Other gains of secondary forest from more permanent pastures averaged about 12 +/- 11 kha (95% CI), while losses of secondary forest averaged 20 +/- 12 kha (95% CI).

AB A novel method called Continuous Subpixel Monitoring (CSM) was developed to map and monitor urban impervious surface change continuously at the subpixel level. Time series model of each pixel was first estimated based on clear Landsat observations between 2000 and 2014, and any land surface change was detected by the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. These coefficients and Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of the estimated time series models were then employed as the inputs of random forest regressor. A few experiments with different combinations of variables and bands were explored to better construct random forest regression models. We successfully applied this algorithm to map subpixel urban impervious surface area (ISA%) and characterize its dynamics in Broome County, New York. Several conclusions can be drawn from the results and analyses. First, the integration of subpixel mapping technique and time series analysis in CSM can yield a relatively satisfactory ISA% result at one point in time. With higher precision and smaller bias, its mapping accuracy is better than that of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) percent developed imperviousness product, without using extensive auxiliary data, such as nighttime light image and transportation network. Second, the ISA% change of any time interval can be easily derived and detected by CSM with relatively high accuracy, which have the potential to generate sub-annual ISA% change products. Furthermore, this approach can detect not only urban expansion/intensification (ISA% gain), but also different patterns of urban transitions overtime, such as urban demolition/redevelopment to vegetation (ISA% loss), and surface modifications (no mechanical change). Finally, CSM works well in one of the cloudiest regions in the United States. This algorithm could provide a new direction to map and monitor percent urban impervious surface change in a reliable and efficient way, which also has the potential to apply to other land cover types (e.g., tree, shrub, and barren lands) at the subpixel level.

AB The Bekaa Valley in Lebanon currently hosts the highest number of refugees per capita in the world. It is also the primary agricultural production area in the country. Groundwater levels in some regions of the valley have decreased by > 15m in the last five years. Water use estimates at the regional and the field scale for this valley are crucial for enhancing resilience and for managing competing sectorial water demands. In this research, we derive a novel time series of field-scale actual evapotranspiration for the Bekaa Valley using two one-source energy balance models for the period 1984-2017, utilizing local weather data and all available original Level 1 Landsat thermal imagery and Level 2 surface reflectance products. We compare a modified METRIC model with an automated hot and cold pixel identification procedure run in batch mode to pySEBAL, a new version of SEBAL, which also has its automated anchors pixel selection algorithm. Analysis of 1200 cloud-masked and gap-filled Landsat-derived ET products show that the two models give comparable water use estimates at the seasonal and annual time steps. We estimate an average annual ET of 652 +/- 53mm (or 800 mcm) over the heavily cultivated valley in the last 34 years (with high agreement between both METRIC and pySEBAL models). Most (64%) of the ET is consumed from blue water in the dry season of May-October. ET in the wet season of November-April consumes > 70% of the precipitation in the Bekaa valley. Annual analysis shows no discernable trend in ET across the valley, but there is an increase in irrigated agriculture in the Orontes Basin in the last five years. METRIC yields 15% higher ET than pySEBAL for the non-agricultural lands in summer. A water balance analysis shows that groundwater storage in the Litani basin is decreasing at a rate of 330 +/- 50 mm yr(-1). The outcome of this research also offers unique opportunities for estimating past and future trends of groundwater withdrawals. Results can provide insights into the sustainability of irrigated agriculture and the required international interventions in the water sector for enhancing the resilience of refugee and local communities.

AB Satellite radar altimetry observations of water surface elevation (WSE) have become an important data source to supplement river gauge records. Sentinel-3 is the first radar altimetry mission operating with a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeter at global scale and with a new on-board tracking system (i.e. open-loop), which has great potential in terms of delivering reliable observations of inland water bodies for the next two decades (several future missions include an open-loop tracking mode). In this context, it is very important to investigate the data quality at an early stage. In this study, a comprehensive evaluation of Sentinel-3A (S3A) is conducted at 50 virtual stations (VS) located on a wide range of rivers in China.
   The evaluation of Level 1 data shows that, over mountain rivers, a good prior surface elevation estimate on-board is vital to deliver useful datasets using the S3A open-loop tracking system. The Open-Loop Tracking Command version 5 (OLTC V5) has significantly improved the placement of the range window, which was misplaced and resulted in lack of data over many mountain rivers prior to OLTC V5 (March 2019). However, application of S3A over mountain rivers still requires careful evaluation, especially before March 2019.
   Four retrackers are evaluated including a physical SAR Altimetry Mode Studies and Applications retracker (SAMOSA+), a traditional Offset Center Of Gravity (OCOG), a Primary Peak Center Of Gravity (PPCOG), and a modified Multiple Waveform Persistent Peak (MWaPP+) retracker. For 26 VSs in plain areas, retracked WSE data achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.12 m to 0.9 m. The comparison of retracking methods reveals that SAMOSA+, OCOG, and PPCOG are unable to handle multi-peak waveforms. But the MWaPP+ can significantly improve the accuracy of the estimated WSE over large rivers, especially when the waveforms are contaminated.
   Moreover, our result shows no considerable difference between medium (ca. 300 m wide) and large (wider than 500 m) rivers. Instead, surrounding topography and homogeneity of surroundings are very important factors influencing the shape of a waveform. For rivers surrounded by lakes, man-made channels etc., special care must be taken when processing altimetry data. Dedicated retracking methods, such as MWaPP+, and sophisticated methods for outlier detection are needed to improve precision over such rivers, as demonstrated here for the Yangtze River.

AB Seasonal freeze-thaw (FT) affects over half the northern hemisphere and impacts many key processes of the Earth System such as energy exchange, hydrology and vegetation. Nearly all past studies using spaceborne FT retrievals have focused on characterizing FT specifically for natural environments. FT in the built environment is also routinely studied and a topic of great interest, especially with regards to transportation infrastructure. Whereas natural FT process are frequently investigated using spaceborne observations, FT studies of roads are often limited to local scales, using in situ or nearby weather station data only. Comparisons between FT retrievals obtained from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite and roads in Alaska (AK) and the Contiguous United States (CONUS) showed that spaceborne FT retrievals had good agreement with road data. But those results also indicated that NASA FT retrievals in CONUS were relatively too warm compared to road data. If SMAP FT retrievals were to be used for identifying FT transition timing for applications by the transportation community, it is also important for frozen conditions to be identified more accurately. This work is primarily concerned with improving frozen retrievals made in CONUS by calculating new Normalized Polarization Ratio (NPR) thresholds as compared to those currently used in SMAP FT. We found that focusing on a temporal subset of October through May for comparisons greatly improved the correlation between NPR and effective soil temperature (T-eff, one of SMAP's ancillary datasets), often from about zero to 0.6. We then applied linear regression between NPR and T-eff to obtain new NPR thresholds resulting in the FT-Roads (FT-R) product. NASA FT and FT-R were evaluated against road data at about 1000 locations in CONUS and a battery of different tests indicated that FT-R performed better under nearly all conditions compared to NASA FT. Overall, NASA FT accuracies were 69% and 80% for 6 am and 6 pm SMAP retrievals, while FT-R achieved accuracies of 79% and 82%. We also investigated the potential for using T-eff for road FT (6 am, only) and found that those comparisons were even more accurate (84%). We've also quantified inter- and intraregional differences of SMAP FT performance and found that accuracy metrics vary over twice as much between geographic subdivisions (9%) as compared to between the states within a subdivision (4%). Most importantly, the main goal of improving the detection of in situ frozen conditions in CONUS was realized, with FT-R accurately detecting frozen conditions > 50% more frequently than NASA FT.

AB Lodging - the bending of crop stems - reduces the quantity and quality of cereal crop yields. Early quantification of crop lodging is important to prevent further losses and to facilitate harvesting operations. Crop angle of inclination (CAI) is a quantitative measure of the lodging stage and a component of lodging severity/score. CAI is an important structural parameter for lodged crops and very few studies have investigated its estimation using satellite-based remote sensing. In this study, the performance of Sentinel-1 and multi-incidence angle (FQ8-27 degrees and FQ21-41 degrees) RADARSAT-2 data were investigated for estimating CAI. Temporal crop biophysical/structural parameters (CAI and crop height) and meteorological data (rainfall and wind speed) were collected throughout May 1-June 30, 2018 in a very large commercial farm located in Jolanda di Savoia, Ferrara, Italy. Field data were grouped into different crop lodging stages (non-lodged/healthy (H), moderate lodging (ML), severe lodging (SL) and very severe lodging (VSL)) based on CAI. Quantitative relationships were established between field-measured CAI values and the RS-derived metrics for Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 timeseries using support vector regression (SVR) models. The RADARSAT-2 FQ8 model performed most robustly with a R-CV(2) (cross-validated R-2) of 0.87 and a RMSECV(cross-validated RMSE) of 8.89 degrees while the performance of the Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 FQ21 models were comparable with an RMSECV of 11.35 degrees and 11.63 degrees respectively. Low incidence angle data were particularly sensitive to high CAI values (VSL) while high incidence angle data were useful for predicting lower CAI (ML and SL). While the RADARSAT-2 FQ-8 model outperformed the other two, the Sentinel-1 model still explained 78% of the CAI variability in the study site, which is important in the context of operational crop lodging stage assessment. This is the first study to demonstrate the utility of SAR remote sensing data for estimating CAI as a measure of the lodging stage and a component of lodging severity.

AB Mapping and monitoring of indicators of soil cover, vegetation structure, and various native and non-native species is a critical aspect of rangeland management. With the advancement in satellite imagery as well as cloud storage and computing, the capability now exists to conduct planetary-scale analysis, including mapping of rangeland indicators. Combined with recent investments in the collection of large amounts of in situ data in the western U.S., new approaches using machine learning can enable prediction of surface conditions at times and places when no in situ data are available. However, little analysis has yet been done on how the temporal relevancy of training data influences model performance. Here, we have leveraged the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest, after comparison with other candidates) to identify the potential impact of different sampling times (across months and years) on estimation of rangeland indicators from the Bureau of Land Management's (BLM) Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) and Landscape Monitoring Framework (LMF) programs. Our results indicate that temporally relevant training data improves predictions, though the training data need not be from the exact same month and year for a prediction to be temporally relevant. Moreover, inclusion of training data from the time when predictions are desired leads to lower prediction error but the addition of training data from other times does not contribute to overall model error. Using all of the available training data can lead to biases, toward the mean, for times when indicator values are especially high or low. However, for mapping purposes, limiting training data to just the time when predictions are desired can lead to poor predictions of values outside the spatial range of the training data for that period. We conclude that the best Random Forest prediction maps will use training data from all possible times with the understanding that estimates at the extremes will be biased.

AB Statistical gross primary productivity (GPP) estimation from remote sensing observations has mostly been attempted on the basis of multispectral observations. To make full use of the information contained in vegetation spectra, however, hyperspectral observations should be used in combination with appropriate multivariate methods. Nevertheless, only very few previous studies attempted to estimate GPP directly from hyperspectral observations and did so on the basis of reflectance, with only a limited number of temporally discontinuous observations. In this study, we used long-term, continuous, half-hourly hyperspectral observations covering the visible and near-infrared spectral range to estimate GPP directly from upwelling irradiance using partial least square (PLS) regression in a rice paddy. To gain a better understanding of processes underlying the PLS estimation, we used extensive complementary field observations to run process-based simulations using the SCOPE model. We then applied PLS regression to the simulated hyperspectral data in the same way as for the observations and disentangled contributions related to relevant physiological processes, namely sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and xanthophyll cycle-related spectral changes (XC). We found that upwelling hyperspectral irradiance in the visible and near-infrared spectral range predicted GPP better than reflectance. Furthermore, PLS-based GPP estimates outperformed both far-red SIF and widely used vegetation index-based methods. However, the most relevant information for the observation-based PLS-models was not clearly related to XC or SIF as the near-infrared spectral range showed comparable performance. Also, the simple average of upwelling irradiance over the 850-900 nm range outperformed the other non-multivariate approaches, including far-red SIF. These results held for the evaluation in terms of the seasonal variation of GPP, while there was apparently a small contribution of SIF and XC for the diurnal variation. The simulation-based analysis showed that SIF and XC contributed useful information to both GPP and photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) estimates at both seasonal and diurnal time scales. The strongest unique contribution from either SIF or XC, however, was to the diurnal variation of GPP and XC showed considerably better performance than SIF. We did not find improvements when combining the spectral regions of XC (500-570 nm) and SIF (650-800 nm) to estimate GPP. While SIF showed improvements when combined with the remaining spectral information excluding XC, this was not the case for XC. Our approach combines the strengths of process-based modeling with multivariate statistical analysis to improve our understanding of the usable information content in vegetation spectra and is highly relevant for further developing suitable methods for GPP estimation at large scales.

AB Surface runoff constitutes a large percentage of Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) mass loss at present but is difficult to measure directly. This study provides a novel method to estimate surface runoff through remote sensing of supraglacial lake volumes. Because terminal, non-draining (consistently expanding during the melt season) lakes impound runoff from their surrounding contributing catchments, such changes reflect runoff produced within the catchment. To estimate supraglacial lake volumes, multi-temporal lake maps derived from Landsat-8 images are intersected with dry lake-bed topographic depressions (showing lake bathymetry) identified for two supraglacial catchments (similar to 10 km(2)) in southwestern GrIS, using high-resolution (2 m) ArcticDEMs. Intersecting remotely sensed lake shorelines with their underlying ice surface topography yields multi-temporal lake volume changes, which are then compared with cumulative runoff as simulated by four Surface Mass Balance (SMB) models (HIRHAM5, MAR3.6, RACMO2.3, and MERRA-2). Comparison of cumulative lake infilling with SMB simulations for these two lakes over the period 8-31 July 2015 indicates that SMB models overestimated surface runoff by 106 - 123%. These large offsets improved after early July, overestimating runoff by 40 - 55%. The runoff delay function incorporated into the MAR3.6 model improves simulation of early melt season runoff, signifying the importance of integrating meltwater routing schemes into SMB models for improved understanding of Greenland supraglacial hydrology and surface mass balance.

AB Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) is a remote sensing technique that uses scattered navigation signals opportunistically for science applications. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) is the first science-driven GNSS-R satellite mission. Although the CYGNSS mission is motivated and designed to better observe weather processes, the data are also useful for other applications, including surface hydrology. This paper aims to demonstrate that CYGNSS has a capability for frequent, high-resolution observations of the wetland dynamics across a wide range of timescales in the tropics. Using matched estimates of water depth from the Everglades Depth Estimation Network (EDEN), we develop methods for mapping inundation over the South Florida Everglades wetland region using CYGNSS data. CYGNSS enables inundation mapping at rapid timescales throughout the diverse Everglades ecosystem, and the data could be complementary to those of well-established observational platforms. The strengths of GNSS-R could be leveraged with the strengths of other techniques to enable studies of wetlands dynamically at short timescales.

AB Urban impervious surface coverage is an important parameter to understand effects of hydro-environment on the process of urbanization. Impervious surfaces have altered urban hydrological process, spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and water environment quality and led to increasing frequency and intensity of urban waterlogging. In view of the impact of the increase of impervious surface on urban hydrological environment, there are two problems in current research and application: (1) urban hydrological modeling and impermeability ratio are computed according to multi-level administrative units rather than watersheds; (2) the entire urban hydrological environment is an organic whole, but the urban watersheds system within a city have not been monitored dynamically by considering adjacent watersheds. In view of these two problems, the main innovative points in this research work include (1) first, urban multi-scale watersheds are defined, and impermeability ratios are calculated at multi-scale watersheds level for urban hydrological modeling. (2) Based on urban DEM analysis, considering the interconnection of multiple urban water systems by calculating the dynamic impermeability ratios, the dynamic impact of urban rainfall and runoff changes on the whole urban hydrological environment is monitored. The results show overall impervious surface ratio of each watershed is proportional to the runoff. The ratio of the impervious surface reaches 20%, and the discharge is more than twice that when impervious ratio is 4%. It can be concluded that at watershed level a higher the degree of urbanization can lead to a larger change in the total run off, and the earlier shift of the peak flow.

AB The vegetation clumping index (CI) quantifies the degree to which foliage deviates from a random distribution, and therefore, is an important canopy structural parameter that governs the photosynthesis and evapotranspiration processes in terrestrial ecosystems. While the temporal variation of CI has been investigated in many field studies, there has not been a global CI product that captured its seasonal and inter-annual variations. In this study, a look-up table (LUT) method was developed based on an improved Normalized Difference between Hotspot and Darkspot (NDHD) method to estimate the daily CI from the MODIS V006 MCD43 BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function) product. This new CI product is consistent with field measurements at 33 sites distributed globally (R-2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.04, and bias = -0.01). CI shows stronger seasonal variations for deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) and mixed forests than other vegetation types. The large seasonal differences between evergreen and deciduous vegetation, especially for DBF and deciduous shrubs, allow the CI to be used to detect seasonal structural changes and classify vegetation. The global CI shows a negative correlation to the leaf area index (LAI) for all land cover types, especially forests. The global CI demonstrates an inter annual variation that correlated with global precipitation (R-2 = 0.34). In addition, the global CI shows a global decreasing trend from 2001 to 2017 (-0.007/decade) that was consistent with the increasing LAI (0.049/decade). The time series of CI provides a new perspective for understanding the structural characteristics of vegetation in global ecosystem studies.

AB As an important indicator of plant photosynthetic activity, leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) has often been estimated non-destructively in the past decades from reflectance spectra measured with various spectrometers and leaf-holding accessories. Most studies established LCC predictive models with either integrating sphere measured directional-hemispherical reflectance factor (DHRF) spectra or leaf clip measured bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) spectra. Given the effect of specular reflection on leaf reflectance, it remains unclear how DHRF spectra differ from the corresponding BRF spectra and whether the derived predictive models could be transferred between these two types of spectral data. To fill the gap in spectral examination and model comparison, this study aimed to examine the effect of specular reflection on leaf reflectance properties, the commonly used spectral indices or indicators, and the derived regression models across a broad variety of leaf DHRF and BRF spectra. Specifically, we quantified the difference between leaf BRF and DHRF spectra measurements and evaluated the effect of specular reflection on the estimation of LCC with 20 spectral features in four categories (simple ratio, SR; modified SR, mSR; double difference index, DD and red edge position, REP). Seven measured datasets collected from a combination of species, growing conditions, sites, and years were used to evaluate the model difference and calibrate the unified models across DHRF and BRF spectra. The robustness of those predictive models was validated with independent measured and simulated datasets comprised of both BRF and DHRF spectra.
   Our results demonstrated that the BRF spectra exhibited systematically higher amplitude than DHRF spectra. The widely used vegetation indices (VIs) in the SR category exhibited the most noticeable sensitivity to specular reflection as a significant proportion in BRF spectra. The adverse effect of specular reflection can be alleviated by the other three categories to different extents. With further assessment of model comparisons, we determined four unified models from the pooled data with two DD indices and two REP metrics. Application of the unified models to the validation spectra yielded low RMSE values up to 4.5 mu g/cm(2) and would not result in a significant loss in accuracy as compared to the BRF-specific or DHRF-specific LCC predictive models derived from the four spectral features. The assessment of unified models with comprehensive measured and simulated data could help us better understand the mechanism underlying the specular reflection effect on the relationship of LCC with sensitive spectral features. It will also facilitate the direct estimation of LCC with the common types of leaf reflectance spectra, which is beneficial to rapid and non-destructive determination of LCC for the plant science and agronomy communities.

AB Biodiversity is essential to healthy ecosystem function, influencing productivity and resilience to disturbance. Biodiversity loss endangers essential ecosystem services and risks unacceptable environmental consequences. Global biodiversity observations are needed to provide a better understanding of the distribution of biodiversity, to better identify high priority areas for conservation and to help maintain essential ecosystem goods and services. Traditional in situ biodiversity monitoring is limited in time and space and is usually a costly and time-consuming enterprise. Remote sensing can provide data over a large area in a consistent, objective manner and has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range of ecosystems, typically based on relating spectral properties to the distribution of habitat, species or functional groups. Recent years have witnessed the emergence of methods using imaging spectroscopy to assess biodiversity via plant traits or spectral information content. However, questions regarding the complex drivers of plant optical properties and the scale dependence of spectral diversity biodiversity relationship confound diversity monitoring using remote sensing and must first be better understood before these methods can be operationally applied. To address some of these topics, we (1) review the history of remote sensing approaches in biodiversity estimation, summarizing the pros and cons of different methods, (2) illustrate successes and major gaps of remote sensing of biodiversity, and (3) identify promising future directions. We focus on emerging methods using spectral diversity (optical diversity) as a proxy for terrestrial plant diversity that offer to revolutionize the study of diversity in its different dimensions (phylogenetic, taxonomic, and functional diversity) from remote sensing. We also discuss remaining knowledge gaps and ways spectral diversity might be effectively integrated into a global biodiversity monitoring system, bridging a gap between ecology and remote sensing.

AB The Prairie Pothole Region of North America is characterized by millions of depressional wetlands, which provide critical habitats for globally significant populations of migratory waterfowl and other wildlife species. Due to their relatively small size and shallow depth, these wetlands are highly sensitive to climate variability and anthropogenic changes, exhibiting inter- and intra-annual inundation dynamics. Moderate-resolution satellite imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel) alone cannot be used to effectively delineate these small depressional wetlands. By integrating fine spatial resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and multi-temporal (2009-2017) aerial images, we developed a fully automated approach to delineate wetland inundation extent at watershed scales using Google Earth Engine. Machine learning algorithms were used to classify aerial imagery with additional spectral indices to extract potential wetland inundation areas, which were further refined using LiDAR-derived landform depressions. The wetland delineation results were then compared to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) geospatial dataset and existing global-scale surface water products to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. We tested the workflow on 26 watersheds with a total area of 16,576 km(2) in the Prairie Pothole Region. The results showed that the proposed method can not only delineate current wetland inundation status but also demonstrate wetland hydrological dynamics, such as wetland coalescence through fill-spill hydrological processes. Our automated algorithm provides a practical, reproducible, and scalable framework, which can be easily adapted to delineate wetland inundation dynamics at broad geographic scales.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is an important physical quantity at the land-atmosphere interface. Since 2016 the Collection 6 (C6) MODIS LST product is publicly available, which includes three refinements over bare soil surfaces compared to the Collection 5 (C5) MODIS LST product. To encourage the use of the C6 MODIS LST product in a wide range of applications, it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy of the C6 MODIS LST product. In this study, we validated the C6 MODIS LST product using temperature-based method over various land cover types, including grasslands, croplands, cropland/natural vegetation mosaic, open shrublands, woody savannas, and barren/sparsely vegetated. In situ measurements were collected from various sites under different atmospheric and surface conditions, including seven SURFRAD sites (BND, TBL, DRA, FPK, GCM, PSU, and SXF) in the United States, three KIT sites (EVO, KAL, and GBB) in Portugal and Namibia, and three HiWATER sites (GBZ, HZZ, and HMZ) in China. The spatial representativeness of the in situ measurements at each site was separately evaluated during daytime and nighttime using all available clear-sky ASTER LST products at 90 m spatial resolution. Only six sites during daytime are selected as sufficiently homogeneous sites despite the usually high spatial thermal heterogeneity, whereas during nighttime most sites can be considered to be thermally homogeneous and have similar LST and air temperature. The C6 MODIS LST product was validated using in situ measurements from the selected homogeneous sites during daytime and nighttime: except for the GBB site, large RMSE values ( > 2 K) were obtained during daytime. However, if only satellite LST with a high spatial thermal homogeneity on the MODIS pixel scale are used for LST validation, the best daytime accuracy (RMSE < 1.3 K) for the C6 MODIS LST product is achieved over the BND and DRA sites. Except for the DRA site, the RMSE values during nighttime are < 2 K at the selected homogeneous sites. Furthermore, the accuracy of the C6 MODIS LST product was compared with that of the C5 MODIS LST product during nighttime at the selected homogeneous sites. Except for the GBB site, there are only small differences ( < 0.4 K) between the RMSE values for the C5 and C6 MODIS LST products.

AB Individual mangrove tree parameters are necessary for the efficient management and protection of this unique ecosystem, but to measure them using remote sensing (RS) is still a new and challenging task due to the high clumping density of mangrove crowns and the relatively low spatial resolution of RS data. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as an emerging RS technique, significantly improves the spatial resolution, but has not been used for individual mangrove analysis. This study presents the first investigation into the possibility of individual tree detection and delineation (ITDD) for mangroves using light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data (91 pt./m(2)) collected from UAV. Specifically, we aim to detect and measure tree height (TH) and crown diameter (CD) of each mangrove tree, and analyze the impact of crown clumping density and spatial resolution on mangrove ITDD. To this end, we combined the variable window filtering method and marker controlled watershed segmentation algorithm, and successfully delineated 46.0% of the 126 field measured mangroves. This was promising considering the complexity of mangrove forest. TH and CD were estimated with higher accuracies than previous studies. The isolated trees, with the lowest clumping density, were delineated with the highest accuracy. To identify the optimal spatial resolution of canopy height model (CHM), we defined four spatial resolutions (0.1 m, 0.25 m, 0.5 m, and 1 m) and conducted a simulation. Based on the results, we propose a rule-of thumb that the spatial resolution should be finer than one-fourth of CD for ITDD, which is also applicable to other forest types. The main difficulty for mangrove ITDD is an overall under-detection of trees, which is caused by the high clumping density and limited height difference between adjacent mangroves. We recommend combining UAV LiDAR with imagery and terrestrial LiDAR to improve the mangrove ITDD performance.

AB Accuracy is an integral component in consumption of land cover and change information. Accuracy characterization in change categorization is more complicated than that in single-date classifications, especially when pursued at a local or per-pixel basis. In this paper, reference sample data consisting of reference class labels at sample locations are referred to as (model) training and validation sample data, respectively, when they are used for building and testing predictive models of local accuracy. They are preferably collocated to verify land cover and change types at the same locations across multiple single-date classifications. With collocated training data, methods devised for local accuracy mapping were usually implemented as direct extensions to those designed for accuracy predictions in single-date land cover maps, given that both response and explanatory variables are defined properly based on change maps. However, alternative methods are required when collocated training sample data are unavailable or sparse but non-collocated data collected at sample units not aligned across time exist or can be made available more conveniently and flexibly. This is typically the case for change-classification accuracy analyses, whereby prior sampling design and sample data may not remain informative in time but can be made adaptive by restructuring and augmentation to better represent strata of transitions as well as persistence. Such adaptability leads to great cost-saving in sampling than undertaking collocated sampling anew each time performing or revising accuracy mapping for a specific change analysis over a particular period. With a coherent review of related research, this paper proposes a geostatistical method for predictive mapping of local accuracies in any land-cover change maps created properly through adaptive use of complexly configured training sample data. This method works on a functional relation between accuracies in change-categorization and single-date classifications whereby temporal correlation (cross-correlation) between bi-temporal classification correctness is accommodated. In this cross-correlation-adjusted product method (named PXCOV), quantification of single-date classification accuracies is based on logistic regression. Cross correlation is estimated via cross-validation cokriging through exploiting a useful relation between traditional and pseudo cross-variograms in the absence of collocated sample data or calculated more easily on the basis of collocated sample data if available. Studies were undertaken to test this method and compare it with direct logistic-regression-kriging (named LogRK direct), its simpler version, direct logistic regression without kriging (named LogR direct), and the baseline product method (named Product, being a simpler option of PXCOV without accounting for cross-correlation), using GlobeLand30 2000 and 2010 land cover at five sites in China. For each site, eleven training samples of equal sizes but differing configurations and one independent validation sample were collected. Logistic regression was performed on map class occurrence pattern indices quantified in size-optimized moving windows for mapping local accuracies in single-date classifications (as necessary intermediate steps in Product and PXCOV) and bi-temporal change-categorization (LogR direct and LogRK direct). In LogRK direct, geostatistical modeling and kriging were based on standardized residuals after logistic regression (based on change maps directly).
   In PXCOV, cross-correlation between single-date classification correctness was estimated and accounted for properly, with their non-stationarity in change vs. no-change strata of sample pixels accommodated, after estimating aforementioned single-date local accuracies. Statistical testing of relative performances of alternative methods was undertaken based on validation samples for individual study sites. It was confirmed that the proposed method PXCOV is more accurate than LogR direct and LogRK direct when there are relatively few collocated sample pixels (i.e., the typical scenarios justifying use of PXCOV). PXCOV is generally more accurate than Product and should be pursued when enough collocated data are available for estimating cross-correlation, although Product is sometimes adequate for practical purposes. LogR direct is recommended over LogRK direct because collocated sample data are often sparse due to low sampling intensities as in large area applications. Therefore, as a method complementing LogR direct and similar methods, PXCOV facilitates adaptive use of training sample data of complex configurations for increased accuracy and efficiency in predictive mapping of local change-categorization accuracies.

AB Satellite aerosol optical depth (ADD) has been widely employed to evaluate ground fine particle (PM2.5) levels, whereas snow/cloud covers often lead to a large proportion of non-random missing AOD. As a result, the fully covered and unbiased PM2.5 estimates will be hard to generate. Among the current approaches to deal with the data gap issue, few have considered the cloud-AOD relationship and none of them have considered the snow-AOD relationship. This study examined the impacts of snow and cloud covers on AOD and PM2.5 and made full-coverage PM2.5 predictions with the consideration of these impacts. To estimate the missing AOD, daily gap-filling models with snow/cloud fractions and meteorological covariates were developed using the random forest algorithm. By using these models in New York State, a daily AOD data set with a 1-km resolution was generated with a complete coverage. The "out-of-bag" R-2 of the gap-filling models averaged 0.93 with an interquartile range from 0.90 to 0.95. Subsequently, a random forest-based PM2.5 prediction model with the gap-filled AOD and covariates was built to predict fully covered PM2.5 estimates. A ten-fold cross-validation for the prediction model showed a good performance with an R-2 of 0.82. In the gap-filling models, the snow fraction was of higher significance in the snow season compared with the rest of the year. The prediction models fitted with/without the snow fraction also suggested the discernible changes in PM2.5 patterns, further confirming the significance of this parameter. Compared with the methods without considering snow and cloud covers, our PM2.5 prediction surfaces showed more spatial details and reflected small-scale terrain-driven PM2.5 patterns. The proposed methods can be generalized to the areas with extensive snow/cloud covers and large proportions of missing satellite AOD for predicting PM2.5 levels with high resolutions and complete coverage.

AB Most of the developed groundwater basins in Iran are subject to land subsidence hazards resulting from the over- extraction of groundwater. Several areas in Tehran, the capital city and a provincial center in north-central Iran, have been reported to be subsiding at different rates. In this study, we present the results of an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series analysis of Tehran using different SAR data between 2003 and 2017. By constructing more than 400 interferograms derived from 39 Envisat ASAR (C-band), 10 ALOS PALSAR (L-band), 48 TerraSAR-X (X-band), and 64 Sentinel-1 (C-band) SAR datasets, we compile displacement time series from interferometric observations using the Small Baseline (SB) technique. Our analysis identifies 3 distinct subsidence features in Tehran with rates exceeding 25 cm/yr in the western Tehran Plain, approximately 5 cm/yr in the immediate vicinity of Tehran international airport, and 22 cm/yr in the Varamin Plain to the southeast of Tehran city. The temporal pattern of land subsidence, which is dominated by a decreasing trend, generally follows the regional decline in groundwater level, which suggests that anthropogenic processes caused by excessive groundwater extraction are the primary cause of land subsidence. Integrating a decadal time series of subsidence constructed from multi-sensor InSAR with in-situ observations suggests that inelastic and permanent compaction dominates the main deformation regime of the Tehran aquifer, and the ratio between elastic and inelastic deformation is approximately 0.4. A geological analysis indicates that the shape of the subsidence bowl in the western Tehran Plain does not follow the trend of major mapped faults in the region. In contrast, the subsidence bowl in Varamin is controlled by the Pishva Fault, which suggests that either this fault acts as a hydrologic barrier to the groundwater flow in this region or that the differences in sediment thickness causes the discontinuity in land subsidence.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer modeling of the transport and interaction of radiation through earth surfaces is challenging due to the complexity of the landscapes as well as the intensive computational cost of 3D radiative transfer simulations. To reduce computation time, current models work with schematic landscapes or with small-scale realistic scenes. The computer graphics community provides the most accurate and efficient models (known as renderers) but they were not designed specifically for performing scientific radiative transfer simulations. In this study, we propose LESS, a new 3D radiative transfer modeling framework. LESS employs a weighted forward photon tracing method to simulate multispectral bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) or flux-related data (e.g., downwelling radiation) and a backward path tracing method to generate sensor images (e.g., fisheye images) or large-scale (e.g. 1 km(2)) spectral images. The backward path tracing also has been extended to simulate thermal infrared radiation by using an on-the-fly computation of the sunlit and shaded scene components. This framework is achieved through the development of a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) and a set of tools to help construct the landscape and set parameters. The accuracy of LESS is evaluated with other models as well as field measurements in terms of directional BREs and pixel-wise simulated image comparisons, which shows very good agreement. LESS has the potential in simulating datasets of realistically reconstructed landscapes. Such simulated datasets can be used as benchmarks for various applications in remote sensing, forestry investigation and photogrammetry.

AB A novel method is presented to measure rock microstructure in hyperspectral mineral maps of rock specimens. Shape parameters were calculated from rock objects in segmented mineral maps. Object area, object perimeter, object hull perimeter and fitted ellipses were used to calculate shape parameters such as compactness, convexity and a cookie-cutter parameter. Shape parameters were used to describe a variety of microstructures and microstructural elements. The parameters were tested on microstructures in artificial imagery and subsequently applied to hyperspectral mineral maps of rocks.
   Analyses of parameters calculated on artificial imagery showed that object shapes could be measured by the flattening of fitted ellipses as a measure of sphericity and elongation, together with the cookie-cutter parameters that measured angularity. Compactness and convexity could differentiate between euhedral, subhedral and anhedral crystal shapes. Aphanitic, phaneritic and porphyritic igneous microstructures could be identified and differentiated by homogeneity and relative object size parameters. The degree of sorting of sedimentary rocks was measured by the distribution of object sizes and statistical parameters describing the distribution. Orientation of single objects was measured by the angle between the major axis of a fitted ellipse and the vertical of the image. Preferred orientations in the rock microstructure were determined by calculation of a standardized resultant of orientation vectors and a mean angle. Layering and banding of the rock was identified by the length of major axes of fitted ellipses relative to the image dimension.
   The shape parameters calculated on objects in segmented hyperspectral mineral maps of rock specimens were able to discriminate between sedimentary and volcanic microstructures using the size distribution of mineral objects, the presence of a preferred orientation of the rock and a layered microstructure. The volcanic microstructures could be differentiated by the size distribution of amygdales, phenocrysts and xenocrysts in the rock. Shape parameters could be used to differentiate between xenocrysts and phenocrysts, the latter being more elongated in the studied samples.
   The study shows that object shape parameters can be used to measure microstructure and microstructural elements in mineral maps, and subsequently discriminate between different rock types and microstructures. The expression of microstructure into numeric parameters is a first step towards quantification of microstructures in mineral maps of rocks. Further development of the methodology could contribute to the creation of unbiased classification scheme of rocks, improved statistical modeling of compositional rock parameters such as mineral ore grades, and the automated recognition of microstructures in large image databases of rocks and drill-core.

AB Vegetation cover absorbs and scatters L-band microwave emission measured by SMOS and SMAP satellites. Misrepresentation of this phenomena results in uncertainties when inferring, for instance, surface soil moisture in retrieval algorithms that commonly utilize the tau-omega model which is most applicable for a weakly scattering medium. In this study, we investigate the degree to which multiple-scattering is prevalent over a range of land cover classifications (from lightly vegetated grasslands to dense forests) at the satellite scale by explicitly accounting for multiple-scattering in a first-order radiative transfer model, developed here. Even though the tau omega model with effective parameters can possibly capture higher-order scattering contributions, deliberately partitioning scattering into different components is required to estimate multiple-scattering properties. Specifically, we aim to determine how one can partition between zeroth and first-order radiative transfer terms within a retrieval algorithm without ancillary information, determine whether this method can detect first-order scattering at the SMAP measurement scale without ancillary information, and quantify the magnitude of detected scattering. A simplified first-order radiative transfer model which characterizes single interactions of microwaves with a scattering medium is developed for implementation within retrieval algorithms. This new emission model is implemented within a recently developed retrieval algorithm, the multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MT-DCA), which does not require ancillary land use information. Scattering parameters as well as SM and vegetation optical depth (tau) are retrieved simultaneously in Africa and South America using the first year of SMAP brightness temperature measurements on a 36 km grid. Specifically, an introduced time invariant first-order scattering coefficient (omega(1)) is retrieved representing microwave emission interaction with the canopy. We find that omega(1) is typically zero in lightly vegetated biomes and non-zero (similar to 0.06) in 74% of the forest pixels. In forest-dominated pixels, the median first-order emissivity is 0.04, or about 4.3% of a given SMAP radiometer brightness temperature measurement. Additionally, explicitly accounting for first-order scattering terms in the radiative transfer model tends to increase SM and tau retrievals by a median of 0.02 m(3)/m(3) and 0.1, respectively, only in forested regions. This study demonstrates the first attempt to explicitly partition higher order scattering terms in a retrieval algorithm at a satellite scale and ultimately provides a fundamental understanding and quantification of multiple-scattering from grasslands to forests.

AB We use total (sea ice plus snow) freeboard as estimated from Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) Geophysical Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) observations to compute Antarctic sea-ice thickness and volume. In order to overcome assumptions made about the relationship between snow depth and total freeboard or biases in snow depth products from satellite microwave radiometry, we implement a new algorithm. We treat the sea ice-snow system as one layer with reduced density, which we approximate by means of a priori information about the snow depth to sea-ice thickness ratio. We derive this a priori information directly from ICESat total freeboard data using empirical equations relating in-situ measurements of total freeboard to snow depth or sea-ice thickness. We apply our new algorithm (one-layer method or OLM), which uses the buoyancy equation approach without the need for auxiliary snow depth data, to compute sea-ice thickness for every ICESat GLAS footprint from a valid total freeboard. An improved method for sea-ice volume retrieval is also used to derive ice volume at 6.25 km scale. Spatio-temporal variations of sea-ice thickness and volume are then analyzed in the circumpolar Antarctic as well as its six sea sectors: Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Weddell East, Weddell West, Bell-Amund Sea, and Ross Sea, under both interannual and seasonal scales. Because the OLM algorithm relies on only one parameter, the total freeboard, and is independent of auxiliary snow depth information, it is believed to become a viable alternative sea-ice thickness retrieval method for satellite altimetry.

AB Prolonged periods of wet soil conditions, when present during critical crop development stages, can significantly elevate the risk of some crop diseases. Wet soils in fields of flowering canola are a concern with respect to the development of sclerotinia as this pathogen feeds on the petals of the canola flower. As such, determining if canola is in bloom during periods of high moisture is important in deciding whether to take action to mitigate this disease. In this paper, RADARSAT-2 quad polarization and TerraSAR-X dual polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were used with a novel dynamic filtering framework to estimate canola growth stages. In this process, a new crop growth stage indicator was developed and SAR polarimetric parameters sensitive to changes in phenology were identified. Model development used multi-year SAR satellite and field data for one site in Manitoba, Canada. The crop growth estimator was then tested on unseen data from three sites, one in each of Canada's Prairie provinces. This independent validation established that the growth estimator was able to accurately determine canola growth stage and date of flowering with high accuracy. Correlation coefficients (r-values) between observed and estimated phenology ranged from 0.91 to 0.96. Given that this method performed well on test data from other sites and years, this approach could be widely adopted for monitoring the development of canola over extended regions.

AB The quantification of aquifer contribution to river discharge is of primary importance to evaluate the impact of climatic and anthropogenic stresses on the availability of water resources. Several baseflow estimation methods require river discharge measurements, which can be difficult to obtain at high spatio-temporal resolution for large basins. The future Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will provide discharge estimations for large rivers ( > 50-100 m wide) even in ungauged basins. The frequency of these estimations depends mainly on latitude and ranges from zero to more than ten values in the 21-day satellite cycle. This work aims at answering the following question: can baseflow be estimated from SWOT observations during the mission lifetime? An algorithm based on hydrograph separation by Chapman's filter was developed to automatically estimate the baseflow in a river network at regional scale ( > 10 000 km(2)). The algorithm was applied to the Seine river basin (75 000 km(2), France) using the discharge time series simulated at daily time step by a coupled hydrological-hydrogeological model to obtain the reference baseflow estimations. The same algorithm is then forced with discharge time series sampled at SWOT observation frequency. The average baseflow is estimated with good accuracy for all the reaches which are observed at least once per cycle (relative bias less than 8%). The time evolution of baseflow is also rather well retrieved, with a Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient above 0.7 for 96% of the network length. An analysis of the effect of SWOT discharge uncertainties on baseflow estimation shows that bias is the component of discharge error that most contributes to the error on baseflow. Anyway, when the combined effect of SWOT discharge sampling and SWOT discharge uncertainties is considered, the error on baseflow estimates is slightly smaller than that on discharge. This work provides new potential for the SWOT mission in terms of global hydrological analysis and water cycle closure.

AB The study investigates the suitability of Sentinel-1 data product of C-band frequency (5.36 GHz) in the estimation of terrestrial biomass. The experiment was carried out in the Perambular District, Tamil Nadu, India. The model DPSVI (Dual Polarization SAR Vegetation Index) was proposed based on the pattern of scatter plot constructed between the backscattering coefficient of VV (sigma(0)(vv)) and VH (sigma(0)(vh)) imageries in which the pixels representing the surface features such as vegetation, soil, and water bodies were distributed according to the theory 'Degree of Depolarization (DOP)'. The model was developed by proposing and integrating three crucial parameters (i) Inverse Dual-Pol Diagonal Distance (IDPDD) (ii) Vertical Dual De-polarization Index (VDDPI) and (iii) sigma(0)(vh) which are highly influential towards biomass extraction. The model was executed for two different seasons (wet and dry) from 2015 to 2017. The resultant output was tested with Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel 2, and the field observed Above Ground Biomass (AGB) from 50 sampling locations to demonstrate the theoretical and in-situ potential of the proposed model. The resultant product of the DPSVI has shown the acceptable R-2 value of 0.75 for the dry season and 0.73 for the wet season with NDVI and got R-2 value of 0.73 for the dry and R-2 value of 0.70 for the wet season with AGB which manifested that the proposed model was an effective indicator of terrestrial vegetation irrespective of seasons.

AB Inhabitants and ecosystems in delta areas are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the effects of subsidence, caused by anthropogenic activities. Yangon is a city on the periphery of the Irrawaddy delta in Myanmar where little is known about the true extent of this hazard, while its effects can potentially harm millions of its inhabitants. This research presents the magnitude and extent of the subsidence hazard in Yangon through a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) time-series analysis on the Sentinel-1 data archives in the period of December 2015 through April 2017. The PSI analysis revealed four distinct zones of varying sizes where vertical velocity differences over 20 mm/yr were found, locally exceeding 110 mm/yr. The significant subsidence zones are exclusively located in young Alluvium deposits and 95% of velocity differences over 10 mm/yr are found at Quaternary age deposits. The addition of loads, such as buildings, predominantly affect subsidence rates in the first decade after placement. Estimates of groundwater extraction for domestic supply, used by more than 2 million inhabitants, correlate with the township average subsidence rates which shows that most subsidence in Yangon can be explained by groundwater extraction. Current operation of groundwater extraction wells induces an aquifer volume loss of 5.5 million cubic meter per year in the aquifer system of Yangon city. Unless groundwater extractions are mitigated, Yangon will be increasingly vulnerable to infrastructural damages, flooding events, and degrading aquifer quality.

AB The ability of medium-resolution (10-30 m) satellite imagery to delineate the size and persistence of ponds on debris-covered glaciers is a topic of recent interest as it has become apparent through the use of fine-resolution products that smaller ponds have often been neglected. In this study, we performed a quantitative analysis of pond detection using a normalised difference water index (NDWI) applied to several widely used satellite sensors, which offer multispectral information at high radiometric precision. These data include: RapidEye (5 m spatial resolution), Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) (10-20 m), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multispectral imagery (30 m). We demonstrate a method to derive an optimum NDWI value for pond classification using a subset reference dataset of 285 ponds classified using fine-resolution (0.5 m) imagery. We then applied the optimised NDWI (NDWI-O) to the remaining images to assess pond classification accuracy against a broader reference dataset of 898 ponds. NDWI values calculated using Sentinel-2 imagery showed the best spectral contrast between water and surrounding debris cover, and the strongest relationship with pixel water content (R-2 = 0.56), followed by the RapidEye NDWI (R-2 = 0.45). We conclude that RapidEye and Sentinel-2 imagery is best suited for accurate pond classification using a multispectral classification approach, which is important for quantifying their role in glacier ablation, meltwater regulation, and lake development. By comparison, the impact of using coarse-resolution Landsat 8 imagery to characterise surface water dynamics is minimised when applied to large glacier lakes, where the area-to-perimeter ratio is greater.

AB Knowledge over the number of animals in large wildlife reserves is a vital necessity for park rangers in their efforts to protect endangered species. Manual animal censuses are dangerous and expensive, hence Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with consumer level digital cameras are becoming a popular alternative tool to estimate livestock. Several works have been proposed that semi-automatically process UAV images to detect animals, of which some employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a recent family of deep learning algorithms that proved very effective in object detection in large datasets from computer vision. However, the majority of works related to wildlife focuses only on small datasets (typically subsets of UAV campaigns), which might be detrimental when presented with the sheer scale of real study areas for large mammal census. Methods may yield thousands of false alarms in such cases. In this paper, we study how to scale CNNs to large wildlife census tasks and present a number of recommendations to train a CNN on a large UAV dataset. We further introduce novel evaluation protocols that are tailored to censuses and model suitability for subsequent human verification of detections. Using our recommendations, we are able to train a CNN reducing the number of false positives by an order of magnitude compared to previous state-of-the-art. Setting the requirements at 90% recall, our CNN allows to reduce the amount of data required for manual verification by three times, thus making it possible for rangers to screen all the data acquired efficiently and to detect almost all animals in the reserve automatically.

AB A new atmospheric correction (AC) method for aquatic application of metre-scale resolution (MR) optical satellite imagery is presented in this article, and demonstrated using images from the Pleiades constellation. MR satellites are typically operated privately and imagery can be costly. However in recent years, the price of individual acquisitions has dropped and their revisit times have improved, making them promising tools for remote sensing of inland and coastal waters. Due to the spatial resolution requirements of these satellites, the bands on the sensors are relatively wide (60-140 nm on Pleiades) in order to achieve an acceptable signal to noise ratio. This bandwidth and the limited number of bands can pose problems for the AC as the water signal may not be negligible in any band, especially over turbid waters. Since the MR sensors have a relatively narrow swath (20 km for Pleiades) the atmosphere can generally be assumed to be homogeneous over a scene or subscene. This assumption allows the atmospheric path reflectance (rho(path)) to be estimated from multiple targets in the scene, which are selected according to the lowest observed top-of-atmosphere reflectances (rho(TO)(A)) in all bands. Rather than using pre-defined "dark" bands (e.g. in the NIR and SWIR) such as is common in other water-focused AC methods, the best band is selected automatically, i.e. the one yielding the lowest rho(path). This criterion avoids unrealistic negative ("overcorrected") reflectances after the AC. Furthermore, for inland waters the NIR bands are usually affected by scattering from adjacent land and vegetation pixels, resulting in unrealistic rho(path) when used in the AC. The spatial resolution of the sensors is used as an advantage here, since ground-level object shadows (e.g. from trees and buildings) can be spatially resolved and are usually the pixels selected by the automated procedure for the determination of rho(path). In fact, it is proposed that using these shadow pixels gives better performance than using any kind of water pixel for these broad-band MR sensors. The method is demonstrated using several Pleiades images, showing good performance in retrieval of the aerosol optical thickness (tau(a)) for an urban (Brussels) and a coastal (Zeebrugge) site. Match-ups with water reflectances measured at the Zeebrugge AERONET-OC station show promising performance, although there is a significant spectral mismatch between the bands on the satellites and the CIMEL radiometer. Pleiades imagery of Zeebrugge reveals a turbid wake associated with the MOW1 measurement station, which opens perspectives of using MR satellites for the characterisation of monitoring and validation sites. Future work includes the application to other MR satellites (e.g. WorldView) and the evaluation for mass processing of open access high resolution (10-60 m) satellite data from Landsat and Sentinel-2.

AB Global monitoring of soil moisture and snow is now available through various satellite observations from optical, microwave, and gravitational sensors. However, very few modeling frameworks exist that conjointly use the above sensors to produce mutually and physically consistent earth system records. To this goal, a prototype of multi-sensor land data assimilation system is developed by linking the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) and a series of forward models with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The deterministic Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) within the DART is utilized to estimate global soil moisture and snow by assimilating brightness temperature, snow cover fraction, and daily total water storage observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), respectively. A 40-member of Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) reanalysis is adopted to introduce ensemble spread in CLM4 land states and some methods are used to reduce the computational load. Data assimilation with different combinations of sensors is implemented for 2003-2009 to investigate individual contributions from different satellite observations. Evaluation results and cross-comparison of open-loop and data assimilation cases suggest that 1) assimilation of MODIS snow cover fraction slightly improves snow estimation in mid and high latitudes; 2) lower and higher frequencies of AMSR-E brightness temperature play complementary roles in improving global soil moisture and snow estimation; 3) assimilation of GRACE tends to degrade soil moisture estimation but poses potential in improving snow depth estimation in most high-latitude regions. Generally, the combination of MODIS, GRACE, and AMSR-E observations with regard to spatial locations holds promise to provide a robust global soil moisture and snow estimation through the multi-sensor land data assimilation system.

AB Urban land-use mapping is a significant yet challenging task in the field of remote sensing. Although numerous classification methods have been developed for obtaining land-use information in urban areas, the accuracy and efficiency of these methods are insufficient to meet the requirements of real-world applications such as urban planning and land management. In recent years, deep learning techniques, especially deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), have achieved an astonishing level of performance in image classification. However, the traditional DCNN methods do not focus on multispectral remote sensing images with more than three channels, and they are limited by their training samples. In addition, these methods uniformly decompose large images into small processing units, which chop up the land-use patterns and produce land-use maps with obvious "blocks". In this study, a semi-transfer deep convolutional neural network (STDCNN) approach is proposed to overcome these weaknesses. The proposed STDCNN has three parts: one part involves a transferred DCNN with deep architecture; another part is designed to analyze multispectral images; and the final part fuses the first two parts into a classification layer. Moreover, a skeleton-based decomposing method using street block data is devised to maintain the integrity of the land-use patterns. In two case studies, the proposed method is used to generate urban land-use maps from a WorldView-3 image of a 143 km(2) area of Hong Kong and a WorldView-2 image of a 25 km(2) area of Shenzhen. The results show that the proposed STDCNN obtains an overall accuracy (OA) of 91.25% and a Kappa coefficient (Kappa) of 0.903 for Hong Kong land-use classification, and an OA of 80% and a Kappa of 0.780 for Shenzhen land-use classification. In addition, due to the proposed skeleton-based decomposition method, the proposed method can produce better land-use maps for real-world urban applications.

AB The objective of this paper is to investigate the dependency of oil spill observations in polarimetric SAR data on imaging geometry, i.e., on incidence angle and look direction relative to the wind. The study is based on quad-polarization data acquired by the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar over experimental oil slicks under relatively high winds of 10-12 m/s over an 8-hour period. The data is collected over a wide range of incidence angles and alternates between looking upwind (UW) and downwind (DW). The unique time series enables a detailed study of the behavior of multipolarization parameters over clean sea and oil slicks under varying imaging geometry to be carried out for the first time. For clean sea backscatter, our findings are in agreement with previous studies, showing decreasing backscatter as the incidence angle increases and from UW to DW, with the highest sensitivity in the HH channel. We also find similar variations in oil covered areas. The results suggest that the oil slick backscatter is slightly more sensitive to the relative wind direction than the clean sea, and higher oil-sea damping ratios are found in DW than in UW cases, particularly in the HH channel. All multipolarization features investigated have some degree of dependency on imaging geometry. The lowest sensitivities are found in the magnitude of the copolarization correlation coefficient, the standard deviation of the copolarized phase difference, the polarization difference, the mean scattering angle and the entropy. Several features clearly change behavior when the signal approaches the sensor noise floor, and we find that the measurements and derived parameters may be affected at even higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels than previously proposed, i.e., closer to 7-9 dB above the sensor noise floor. Overall, the polarization difference is clearly identified as the most interesting parameter for oil spill observation, producing high oil-sea contrast in addition to low sensitivity to imaging geometry. The results show that both the relative wind direction and the incidence angle, in combination with the SNR, should be taken into account when developing operational methods based on multipolarization SAR data.

   A disaggregation technique, based on the Smoothing Filter based Intensity Modulation (SFIM), enabled us to obtain co-located SMAP and AMSR2 brightness measurements at L, C, X, Ku and Ka bands at approximately 10 km x 10 km on the selected test area, which corresponds to the entire Italian territory. These disaggregated microwave data were used as inputs of the "HydroAlgo" retrieval algorithm based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which were able to exploit the synergy between radiometric acquisitions from these two sensors. The algorithm was defined, implemented and tested using all the overlapping orbits of SMAP and AMSR2 over Italy throughout the 9_month period between April and December 2015. Distributed SMC reference values for implementing and validating the algorithm were obtained from the Soil Water Balance hydrological model, SWBM. Through HydroAlgo, an SMC product at a resolution of approximately 10 km x 10 km was obtained. This result is close to the original Radar/Radiometer SMC product from SMAP, with an average correlation coefficient R > 0.75 and RMSE congruent to 0.03 m(3)/m(3), in both ascending and descending orbits.

AB Measurements of surface thermal infrared (TIR) radiance that are made to extract temperatures display strong directional anisotropy effects. Directional brightness temperature (BT) models that describe this anisotropic behavior of TIR emissions can be applied to separate component temperatures using multi-angle observations. The surface temperature differences that occur between sunlit and shaded areas and the leaf clumping phenomenon jointly affect the directional signatures of out-of-canopy directional BTs. However, these factors are not fully considered in existing directional BT models. This paper therefore extends the FR97 analytical model to 1) a four-component scene containing sunlit and shaded soil and leaves by incorporating the effective emissivity values of the sunlit and shaded parts and 2) row-planted crop and forest canopies by introducing a leaf clumping index. The proposed model was assessed using a synthetic dataset that was generated by the Thermal Radiosity-Graphics Combined Model (TRGM) under various conditions. The evaluation results indicated that the proposed model performed as well as the Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (4SAIL) model over continuous canopies with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) lower than 0.3 degrees C. Over non-continuous crops and forests, the behavior of the proposed model displayed improved agreement with the TRGM with RMSEs lower than 0.65 degrees C. The proposed model also displayed a robust performance over both the maize and pine canopies, which was evaluated against the directional anisotropy of measured datasets that were collected at the Huailai remote sensing test site and the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), respectively. From these points, the proposed model has potential for component temperature inversion and rapid assessment of TIR angular effects.

AB Solar energy utilization will play an increasingly important role in sustainable urban development because it will help motivate low-carbon development. This study proposed a framework that calculates the solar irradiance on roofs and facades of city-scale buildings, as well as the potential reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions that can be derived from solar energy utilization. This framework consolidates data acquired using 3D remote sensing techniques (e.g., light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and digital photogrammetry) with existing 3D building vector models from urban planning and building design. To further the economical use of solar energy, the framework provides a new strategy based on three aspects (threshold, structure, and orientation), for a more realistic analysis of the available area of roofs and facades, by combining street view images and point clouds. Nanjing, China, was selected as a study area for validating and analyzing the proposed framework. The experimental area covers approximately 30 km(2) and 5216 buildings. The reliability of the proposed method was validated by comparing the results with the computation modules of mainstream commercial programs and previous international studies. The following conclusions were drawn from the experimental area. (1) Annual solar energy on the roofs of all buildings was 9647.89 GWh, corresponding to a PV yield of 1447.18 GWh, which equates to reductions of 584.66 kt in standard coal consumption and 1261.94 kt in CO2 emissions. The annual solar energy on the facades was 5364.63 GWh, corresponding to a PV yield of 804.69 GWh, which equates to reductions of 325.10 kt in standard coal consumption and 701.69 kt in CO2 emissions. (2) Based on the calculated potential solar energy utilization of the building envelopes, it was shown that the utilization of solar radiation on roofs and facades would promote low-carbon urban development. The utilization of solar energy on the facades of high buildings will contribute to the supply of energy for these buildings and help balance their energy consumption. (3) As the solar incidence angle changes over time, the reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions related to PV power generation are maximal in summer for building roofs, whereas no significant seasonal differences were observed for facades. (4) Incorporating the available area translates the utilization of solar energy and potential CO2 reductions from theory to practical application by reducing inefficient and invalid areas. The percentages of available area of roof and facade were estimated at 47% and 16% by comprehensive calculations considering three aspects (threshold, structure, and orientation). The corresponding potential of solar energy on the roofs and facades in the validation area B are 167.18 GWh and 53.63 GWh, respectively, compared to the original theoretic values of 316.97 GWh and 237.98 GWh.

ID FRACTAL DIMENSION; MARSH COLLAPSE; LOUISIANA; WETLANDS
AB Coastal Louisiana has been facing a serious land loss problem over the past several decades, and extensive research has been undertaken to address the problem. However, the importance of landscape fragmentation on land loss has seldom been examined. This paper evaluates the effects of landscape fragmentation on land loss in the Lower Mississippi River Basin region. The research hypothesis is that the higher the degree of fragmentation in a locality, the greater the amount of land loss in the next time period. We used Landsat-TM data with a pixel size of 30 m x 30 m in 1996 and 2010 and transformed the images into either land or water pixels. We then calculated the fractal dimension and Moran's I spatial autocorrelation statistics and used them to represent the degree of landscape fragmentation. Four sample box sizes, including sizes of 101 x 101, 71 x 71, 51 x 51, and 31 x 31 pixels, were used to detect if there is a relationship between fragmentation and land loss at different neighborhood (context) scales. For each box size, 100 samples were randomly selected. To isolate the fragmentation effect so that it can be better evaluated, we used only sample boxes with a 50% land-water ratio. Regression results between fragmentation and land loss show that the R-2 values for box sizes of 71 x 71, 51 x 51 and 31 x 31 were statistically significant (0.20, 0.45, 0.35; p < 0.001 for Moran's I) but not for the 101 x 101 box size. These results imply that land protection may be most effective by prioritizing areas with land patches that have the least fragmentation. Furthermore, the neighborhood scale at which the R-2 value is the highest indicates the scale at which the effects are most likely to be observed (51 x 51 box size, approximately 1.5 x 1.5 km(2), R-2 = 0.45), which suggests that future land loss modeling using this neighborhood scale would be most effective.

AB Between 2013 and 2015, during a time of severe drought and elevated bark beetle (Dendroctonus spp.) activity in California, the amount of conifer mortality in the Southern Sierra Nevada increased greatly. Remote sensing is a critical means of providing up-to-date information on the location, magnitude, and extent of mortality across a broad geographic area. We used eleven Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flight lines, resampled to 30 by 30 m pixel size and acquired on six separate dates as part of the HyspIRI Preparatory Campaign to simulate spaceborne imaging spectroscopy. We also spectrally degraded the AVIRIS images to simulate Landsat-8 data. We tested the ability of single-date and multi-temporal remote sensing to identify red stage conifer mortality, healthy conifer, and non-conifer dominated pixels using a random forest algorithm. Accuracy was assessed with an independent validation dataset acquired via WorldView imagery in areas spatially separate from where training data were collected, as well as through comparison with aerial detection survey and canopy water loss data, with generally good agreement. We found that classifications based on imaging spectroscopy significantly outperformed broadband multispectral feature sets (with a highest overall accuracy of 85.1% obtained by imaging spectroscopy and 80.2% obtained by the simulated multispectral images). We also found that classifications based on multi-temporal imaging spectroscopy were more accurate than single-date imaging spectroscopy (the highest overall accuracy obtained for single-date imaging spectroscopy was 83.4%). Imaging spectroscopy that included interseasonal data from the end of the drought outperformed all other datasets, including interannual data that included only images collected in the summer. Multi-date analysis also improved accuracy using broad band systems. Although current spaceborne assets are adequate for monitoring bark beetle mortality in a heterogeneous ecosystem, a spaceborne imaging spectrometer would further improve operational accuracy.

AB The top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) reflectances of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS) M9 channel and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 26 channel have been simulated using the libRadtran radiative transfer model and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) Vertical Feature Mask data. The simulated data were analyzed to quantify the performance differences between the VIIRS M9 and the MODIS 26 channels. Analysis of simulated clear-sky TOA reflectances showed that compared MODIS channel 26, the VIIRS M9 channel always performs better in reducing background reflectance regardless of latitude, season, surface type, vapor content or surface elevation. For mid-latitude, sub-Arctic and tropical regions the VIIRS M9 channel reduce the background reflectance by approximately 66.7%, 52.6% and 41.5%, respectively over the surface type of sandstone, compared to MODIS channel 26. Simulations for cloudy skies showed that both stratus and cumulus clouds contribute less to VIIRS M9 and MODIS band 26 TOA reflectances. Analysis of observed MODIS, VIIRS and CALIOP data was consistent with the simulated results. The VIIRS M9 decreases clear-sky background reflectance by as much as 35.96% and non-cirrus cloud reflectance by 29.86% compared with the MODIS channel 26. The observed reflectances of MODIS and VIIRS cirrus channels for clear sky, non-cirrus cloud, and cirrus cloud are 0.0133 and 0.0095, 0.020 and 0.015, 0.084 and 0.067 respectively.

AB The monitoring of thermal anomalies such as from wildfires, coal fires, and volcanoes has been a major application of satellite remote sensing. The Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) has achieved sufficient enhanced radiometric performance to quantify visible and near infrared (VNIR) to shortwave infrared (SWIR) radiance emitted from thermal anomalies during nighttime. We propose a method to simultaneously retrieve the brightness temperature and corresponding area of a subpixel hotspot assuming a single isothermal heat source using the spectral radiances in VNIR and SWIR regions (bands 3-7) from nighttime Landsat 8 01,1 data. We conducted a prescribed fire experiment coincident with a Landsat 8 overpass on January 24, 2015. The brightness temperature retrieved from the OLI data agreed with the peak temperature of the time series thermocouple record within 60 K. The retrieved area of fire was 19% of the true fire area. The blackbody assumption (emissivity = 1) might cause the underestimated retrieved area. We applied the hotspot brightness temperature and area retrieval to 17 Landsat 8 scenes that cover Kanto, Japan to validate the proposed method. More than 79% of the detected results were confirmed as true positives based on the land use for each scene. Meanwhile, the obvious false positive was only up to 1% of the detected results. The remaining ambiguous results, mostly found in areas regarding agriculture, were possibly caused by occasional burnings because these locations were never repetitively detected. Time series comparison of the retrieved results in cement plants as a typical stable heat source revealed that the brightness temperature is accurately retrieved, though the retrieval of area is somewhat sensitive to noise on OLI imagery. The proposed method had founded more than twice of the hotspots detected using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) fire products in the studied area. More than 82% among the hotspots from VIIRS were detected by OLI. However our method failed to detect spatially broad but slightly cool hotspots. Higher spatial resolution at an appropriate spectral configuration enabled enhanced sensitivity to detect small heat sources, as well as quantification of the subpixel hotspots.

AB Hyperspectral unmixing is an important technique for remote sensing image exploitation. It aims to decompose a mixed pixel into a collection of spectrally pure components (called endmembers), and their corresponding proportions (called fractional abundances). In recent years, many studies have revealed that unmixing using spectral information alone does not sufficiently incorporate the spatial information in the remotely sensed hyperspectral image, as the pixels are treated as isolated entities without taking into account the existing local correlation among them. To address this issue, several spatial preprocessing methods have been developed to include spatial information in the spectral unmixing process. In this paper, we present a new spatial preprocessing method which presents several advantages over existing methods. The proposed method is derived from the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) method, which adapts the global search scope of the clustering into local regions. As a result, the spatial correlation and the spectral similarity are intrinsically incorporated at the clustering step, which results in O(N) computational complexity of the clustering procedure with N being the number of pixels in the image. First, a regional clustering is iteratively performed by using spatial and spectral information simultaneously. The obtained result is a set of clustered partitions that exhibit both spectral similarity and spatial correlation. Then, for each partition we select a subset of candidate pixels with high spectral purity. Finally, the obtained candidate pixels are gathered together and fed to a spectral-based endmember extraction method to extract the final endmembers and their corresponding fractional abundances. Our newly developed method naturally integrates the spatial and the spectral information to retain the most relevant endmember candidates. Our experimental results, conducted using both synthetic and real hyperspectral scenes, indicate that the proposed method can obtain accurate unmixing results with less than 0.5% of the number of pixels used by other state-of-the-art methods. This confirms the advantages of integrating spatial and spectral information for hyperspectral unmixing purposes.

AB Oil spills have adverse effects on the environment and economy. Near real time detection and response activities enable to better manage the required resources at the incident area for clean-up and control operations. Multi temporal remote sensing (RS) technologies are widely used to detect and monitor oil spills on the Ocean surfaces. However, current techniques using RS data for oil spill detection are time consuming and expensive in terms of computational cost and related infrastructure. The main focus of this work is oil spill detection from voluminous multi-temporal LANDSAT-7 imagery using high performance computing technologies such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and Message Passing Interface (MPI) to speed up the detection process and provide rapid response. Kepler compute architecture based GPU (Tesla K40) with Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), which is a parallel programming mechanism for GPU is used in the development of the detection algorithms. Oil spill detection techniques that were adapted to GPU based processing include band-ratio and Morphological attribute profile (MAP) based on six structural and shape description attributes namely, Gray mean, standard deviation, elongation, shape complexity, solidity and orientation. Experimental results show the significant gains in the computational speed of these techniques when implemented on a GPU and MPI. A GPU vs. CPU comparison shows that the proposed approach achieves a speedup of around 10 x for MAP and 14 x for band ratio approaches, which includes the data transfer cost. However, the MPI implementation using 64 cores outperforms the GPU, and executes the time intensive task of computing the above said attributes in only 18 min, whereas a GPU consumes around an hour.

AB The overall aim of this study was to evaluate the use of seasonal time-series Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery in estimating forest stand parameters in a heterogeneous Mediterranean environment. Within this framework, the random forest regression algorithm was used to model the relationship between spectral information and tree density, basal area, and wood volume, based on single-date, single-season (dry, wet), and multi-temporal (May-December) imagery. The variable importance (VIMP) measure and the minimal depth (MD) order statistic were also investigated with regard to improved prediction accuracy and the identification of relevant variables. In general, the multi-temporal and dry-season models were more accurate than the single-date models. The models resulting from the MD variable selection from the dry season imagery were the most accurate with a coefficient of determination of up to 0.54 for tree density, 0.72 for basal area, and 0.68 for volume.

AB The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) has proven itself as an effective remotely sensed estimator of actual evapotranspiration (ETa). However, it has several vulnerabilities associated with the partitioning of the available energy (AE) at the land surface. We introduce a two stage energy restraint process into the SEBS algorithm (SEBS-ER) to overcome these vulnerabilities. The first offsets the remotely sensed surface temperature to ensure the surface to air temperature difference reflects AE, while the second stage uses a domain based image search process to identify and adjust the proportions of sensible (H) and latent (lambda E) heat flux with respect to AE. We effectively implemented SEBS-ER over 61 acquisitions over two Landsat tiles (path 90 row 84 and path 91 row 85) in south-eastern Australia that feature heterogeneous land covers. Across the two areas we showed that the SEBS-ER algorithm has: greater resilience to perturbed errors in surface energy balance algorithm inputs; significantly improved accuracy (p < 0.05) at two eddy covariance flux towers in heavily forested (RMSE 62.3 W m(-2), R-2 0.879) and sub-alpine grassland (RMSE 33.2 W m(-2), R-2 0.939) land covers; and greater temporal stability across 52 daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimates compared to a temporally stable and independent ETa dataset. The energy restraint within SEBS-ER has reduced exposure to the complex errors and uncertainties within remotely sensed, meteorological, and land type SEBS inputs, providing more reliable and accurate spatially distributed ETa products.

AB In remote sensing data exploitation, spectral mixture analysis is commonly used to detect land cover materials and their corresponding proportions present in the observed scene. In recent years, high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral images have shown their potential for deriving accurate land cover maps. In this paper, a new spectral mixture analysis model for mapping urban environments using high spatial resolution airborne hyperspectral data is proposed. First, non-local self-similarity is exploited to partition the scene into groups of similar pixels. The spectral signals of the pixels in each of these groups are assumed to be comprised of the same endmembers, but with different abundance values. Then, the similar pixels in each group are simultaneously unmixed using a jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis method. The proposed method was applied to map land cover in Pavia city, northern Italy, using airborne ROSIS data. An overall classification accuracy of 97.24% was achieved for the Vegetation - Impervious surface - Soil model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed jointly sparse spectral mixture analysis model is well suited for mapping land cover in urban environments using high resolution hyperspectral data.

AB Accuracy assessment is a standard protocol of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) mapping. Here we report agreement statistics between map and reference labels for NLCD 2011, which includes land cover for ca. 2001, ca. 2006, and ca. 2011. The two main objectives were assessment of agreement between map and reference labels for the three, single-date NLCD land cover products at Level II and Level I of the classification hierarchy, and agreement for 17 land cover change reporting themes based on Level I classes (e.g., forest loss; forest gain; forest, no change) for three change periods (2001-2006, 2006-2011, and 2001-2011). The single-date overall accuracies were 82%, 83%, and 83% at Level II and 88%, 89%, and 89% at Level I for 2011, 2006, and 2001, respectively. Many class-specific user's accuracies met or exceeded a previously established nominal accuracy benchmark of 85%. Overall accuracies for 2006 and 2001 land cover components of NLCD 2011 were approximately 4% higher (at Level II and Level I) than the overall accuracies for the same components of NLCD 2006. The high Level I overall, user's, and producer's accuracies for the single-date eras in NLCD 2011 did not translate into high class specific user's and producer's accuracies for many of the 17 change reporting themes. User's accuracies were high for the no change reporting themes, commonly exceeding 85%, but were typically much lower for the reporting themes that represented change. Only forest loss, forest gain, and urban gain had user's accuracies that exceeded 70%. Lower user's accuracies for the other change reporting themes may be attributable to the difficulty in determining the context of grass (e.g., open urban, grassland, agriculture) and between the components of the forest-shrubland-grassland gradient at either the mapping phase, reference label assignment phase, or both. NLCD 2011 user's accuracies for forest loss, forest gain, and urban gain compare favorably with results from other land cover change accuracy assessments. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Rapid environmental change and increases in use of shorefast ice by industry and coastal communities highlight the need for an approach to accurately assess landfast sea-ice stability on seasonal timescales. While stability can sometimes be inferred from field measurements, current methods are lacking robustness and the ability to be automated and applied over large areas and long time scales to ensure safety and document change in the context of transportation, indigenous ice uses and industrial development. This paper introduces an inverse model capable of reconstructing three-dimensional deformation fields from one-dimensional interferometric L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) phase patterns. We apply this method at three landfast ice locations on the Alaska Beaufort Sea coast near Barrow and Prudhoe Bay. We find the small-scale displacements estimated from the model consistent with regional patterns of ice motion. Our study suggests that interferometry can provide planning and decision -support information for ice road development and structures operating within ice. Moreover, InSAR can potentially increase our understanding of sea ice on a fundamental level in terms of large-scale stability and long-term changes in ice dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Research on processes leading to formation, maintenance, and disappearance of polynyas in the Polar Regions benefits significantly from the use of different types of remote sensing data. The Sentinels of the European Space Agency (ESA), together with other satellite missions, provide a variety of data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, at different spatial scales, and with different temporal resolutions. In a case study we demonstrate the advantage of merging data from different spaceborne instruments for analysing ice conditions and ice dynamics in and around the frequently occurring Terra Nova Bay Polynya (TNBP) in the Ross Sea in the Antarctic. Starting with a list of polynya parameters that are typically retrieved from satellite images, we assess the usefulness of different sensor types. On regional scales (several 100 km), passive microwave radiometers provide a view on the mutual influence of the three Ross Sea polynyas on sea ice drift and deformation patterns. Optical sensors with meter-scale resolution, on the other hand, allow very localized analyses of different polynya zones. The combination of different ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum is essential for recognition and classification of ice types and structures. Radar images together with data from thermal infrared sensors, operated at tens to hundreds of meters resolution, improve the separation of the outlet zone of the polynya from the adjacent pack ice. The direct comparison of radar and passive microwave images reveals the visibility of deformed ice zone in the latter. A sequence of radar images was employed to retrieve ice drift around the TNB, which allows analysing the temporal changes of the polynya area and the extension and structure of the outlet zone as well as ice movements and deformation that are influenced by the katabatic winds.

AB In snow-covered mountainous terrains, topography-induced different illumination conditions would cause varying influence on the snow characteristics in the sunlit and shadowed sites owing to albedo variation. Since the thermal bands suffer less by the shadows as compared to the optical bands, it is imperative to investigate the effect of shadow on the optical and thermal snow indices. The investigation comprises determination of (a) difference of means between the sunlit snow cover and snow cover under shadow for thermal snow indices, optical snow cover indices and optical snow cover characteristic indices and (b) correlation coefficient of the thermal snow indices with the respective optical snow cover indices and optical snow cover characteristic indices. The study was conducted in the test sites of the Chenab basin, western Himalayas using the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor data.
   The mean values of different snow indices exhibit significant difference between the sunlit and shadow test sites with Z-values ranging between 68.92 and 1220.39 (p < 0.0001). Shadow significantly increases correlation of the thermal snow indices with the optical snow cover indices with r >= 0.81, while r-values lie below 0.29 in the sunlit test site (Student's t-test, p < 0.0001). On the other hand, thermal snow indices exhibit low correlation with both optical snow cover characteristic indices in either site; however, shadow induces negative correlation between them (r = 0.37 to 0.62, p < 0.0001). The results ascertain the varying influence of shadow on the optical and thermal snow indices and their interrelationship, which could be significantly helpful for accurate radiative transfer modelling of snow in the light of the seasonal variation in the earth-sun geometry.

AB Pine Island Glacier (PIG) in West Antarctica drains out to the Amundsen Sea through Pine Island Glacier Ice Shelf (PIGIS). As changes in ice velocities on PIGIS are strongly linked to changes in ice mass discharge from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, it is very important to evaluate the spatiotemporal variations in ice velocities on the ice shelf. This research estimated ice velocities of PIGIS from an ensemble of image matching of Landsat time series multispectral data obtained from 2000 to 2014. Orientation correlation was adopted for the image matching of blue, green, red, near infrared, panchromatic, and the first principal image of the Landsat multispectral data, from which the results were combined and averaged. The multispectral image matching proposed in this research produced similar to 35% more ice velocity vectors than the use of a single band (i.e., panchromatic band) image matching. The erroneous matches were filtered through simple but rigorous statistical evaluations. The ice velocity of PIGIS accelerated by similar to 55% during 2000-2010, and the acceleration of the image northing velocity component (similar to 13 km a(-1)) was higher than that of the image easting velocity component (similar to 0.8 km a-1). During 20102012, the ice velocity of PIGIS slowed down by similar to 10%. The ice velocity in 2014 increased by 5% from 2012, but was still lower than the peak values observed in 2010. The surface strain rate fields of PIGIS were derived from the ice velocity fields. The longitudinal ice compression was observed near the grounding line and the geographically northern part of the central ice shelf of PIGIS, while a fast-flowing band was observed near the southern margin of the ice shelf. The transverse strain rate showed that ice divergence in the hinge zone of the central ice shelf has increased since 2000. The width of the shear margins of the central ice shelf of PIGIS is similar to 25 km, which has been stable since 2000. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite thermal remote sensing potentially provides a new way to monitor local climate change due to urbanization, especially changes in surface temperatures that result in the surface urban heat island (SUHI). However, this technique is restricted to clear-sky conditions. Because of this limitation, satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) records are frequently interrupted, sometimes even becoming temporally sparse and, accordingly, climatically less representative. Given this challenge, we propose a strategy that incorporates an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model to perform temporal upscaling of the SUHI from a climatic perspective. Using two mega-cities (Beijing and Shanghai) as case studies, our major findings include: (1) urbanization tends to enlarge the amplitude of annual daytime LST series for both cities; (2) urbanization in Beijing narrows the diurnal LST range on annual average but broadens it in Shanghai; (3) within an annual cycle, the daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) reaches its maximum one month later than the daytime LST maximum for Beijing, whereas this time difference is negligible for Shanghai; and (4) compared with the observation-based and moving-window-based temporal aggregations, the ATC-based temporal aggregation allows to produce a clear-sky SUHI climatology that is more representative and becomes potentially valuable for prediction or application purposes. From a climatic perspective, the temporal upscaling of the SUHI, therefore, provides insights into the impacts on local thermal environments that are induced by urbanization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Forest structural diversity plays a major role for forest management, conservation and restoration and is recognized as a fundamental aspect of forest biodiversity. The assessment, maintenance and restoration of a diversified forest structure have become major foci in the effort to preserve forest ecosystems from loss of biological diversity. However, the assessment of forest biodiversity is difficult because it involves multiple components and is characterized using multiple variables. The objective of the study was to develop a methodological approach for predicting, mapping, and constructing a statistical inference for a multiple-variable index of forest structural diversity. The method included three key components: (i) use of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) technique, field plot data, and airborne laser scanning metrics to predict multiple forest structural diversity variables simultaneously, (ii) incorporation of multiple diversity variable predictions into a single index, and (iii) construction of a statistically rigorous inference for the population mean of the index. Three structural diversity variables were selected to illustrate the method: growing stock volume and the standard deviations of tree diameter at breast-height and tree height. Optimization of the k-NN technique produced mean relative deviations less in absolute value than 0.04 for predictions for each of the three structural diversity variables, R-2 values between 050 and 0.66 which were in the range of values reported in the literature, and a confidence interval for the population mean of the index whose half-width was approximately 5% of the mean. Finally, the spatial pattern depicted in the resulting map of forest structural diversity for the study area contributed to validating the proposed method. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Small spectral differences from the mean remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) of the ocean - anomalies - can provide unique environmental information from ocean color satellite data. First, we describe the average relationship between three input spectral bands and an output band by developing a look-up table (WT) based on the fully normalized Rrs from the MODIS AQUA sensor. By dividing the Rrs measured at the output wavelength by the prediction from the LUT, we obtain several anomalies depending on the combination of input and output bands. None of these anomalies are correlated with chlorophyll concentration on the global scale. Some anomalies are strongly correlated with previously described data products (e.g., CDOM index, backscattering coefficients from semi-analytical inversion models), but others are not correlated with any product currently distributed by NASA. In the latter case, new information about oceanic optical properties is extracted from the ocean color spectra, which allows identification of water masses that was otherwise impossible with standard ocean color products. It was not possible, in some cases, to identify the optical source of this information, which may be spatially and temporally variable. We also show that by removing the main source of variability, the anomalies show interesting potential to identify subtle shifts in sensor response in satellite time series. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Identification of surface water sources in the Arctic Ocean is a key factor to better understand physical and biogeochemical processes. It is however restricted both geographically and temporally when using field observations. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose a new algorithm for discriminating surface water sources using satellite remote sensing data alone. The algorithm uses salinity and the light absorption coefficient of colored dissolved organic matter at 443 nm [a(CDOM)(443), m(-1)] derived from SMOS/MIRAS and Aqua/MODIS satellite sensors, respectively, to identify the fraction of three end-members (i.e., seawater, ice melt water, and river water including precipitation) through the mass balance equations. An uncertainty analysis showed that fractions of river water can be derived reasonably, with caution of fractions for ice melt water and seawater. Application of this algorithm may lead to the discrimination of water sources in the surface layer of the Arctic Ocean in various environments where seawater, ice melt water, and river water are intermingled, which might be useful to improve our understanding of physical and biogeochemical processes related to each water source.

AB The relatively small sampling intensities used by national forest inventories are often insufficient to produce the desired precision for estimates of population parameters unless the estimation process is augmented with auxiliary information, usually in the form of remotely sensed data. The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) technique is a non-parametric, multivariate approach to prediction that has emerged as particularly popular for use with forest inventory and remotely sensed data and has been shown to contribute substantially to increasing precision. k-NN predictions are calculated as linear combinations of observations for sample units that are nearest in a space of auxiliary variables to the population unit for which a prediction is desired. Implementation of a nearest neighbors algorithm requires four choices: (i) a distance metric, (ii) specific auxiliary variables to be used with the distance metric, (iii) the number of nearest neighbors, and a (iv) scheme for weighting the nearest neighbors. Regardless of the choices for a distance metric and weighting scheme, emerging evidence suggests that optimization of the technique, including selection of an optimal subset of auxiliary variables, greatly enhances prediction. However, optimization can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. A promising approach that is gaining favor is based on genetic algorithms, a technique that uses search heuristics that mimic natural selection to solve optimization problems.
   The objective of the study was to compare optimized k-NN configurations with respect to inferences for mean volume per unit area using airborne laser scanning variables as auxiliary information. For two study areas, one in Norway and one in Minnesota, USA, the analyses focused on optimizing k-NN configurations that used the weighted Euclidean and canonical correlation distance metrics and two neighbor weighting schemes. Novel features of the study include introduction of a neighbor weighting scheme that has not previously been used for forestry applications, simultaneous optimization of all four k-NN choices, and basing comparisons on confidence intervals, rather than intermediate products such as prediction accuracies. Two conclusions were primary: (1) optimized selection of feature variables produced greater precision than using all feature variables, and (2) computational intensity necessary to optimize the weighted Euclidean metric was considerably greater than for the canonical correlation analysis metric. Specific findings were that optimization produced pseudo-R-2 as large as 0.87 for the Norwegian dataset and as large as 0.89 for the Minnesota dataset. For the optimized canonical correlation distance metric, widths of approximate 95% confidence intervals as proportions of the estimated means were as small as 0.13 for the Norwegian dataset and as small as 0.15 for the Minnesota dataset.

AB Snowfall comprises a significant percentage of the annual water budget in High Mountain Asia (HMA), but snow water equivalent (SWE) is poorly constrained due to lack of in-situ measurements and complex terrain that limits the efficacy of modeling and observations. Over the past few decades, SWE has been estimated with passive microwave (PM) sensors with generally good results in wide, flat, terrain, and lower reliability in densely forested, complex, or high-elevation areas.
   In this study, we use raw swath data from five satellite - sensors the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSMI) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) (1987-2015, F08, F11, F13, F17), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E, 2002-2011), AMSR2 (2012-2015), and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM, 2014-2015) - in order to understand the spatial and temporal structure of native sensor, topographic, and land cover biases in SWE estimates in HMA. We develop a thorough understanding of the uncertainties in our SWE estimates by examining the impacts of topographic parameters (aspect, relief, hillslope angle, and elevation), land cover, native sensor biases, and climate parameters (precipitation, temperature, and wind speed). HMA, with its high seasonality, large topographic gradients and low relief at high elevations provides an excellent context to examine a wide range of climatic, land-cover, and topographic settings to better constrain SWE uncertainties and potential sensor bias.
   Using a multi-parameter regression, we compare long-term SWE variability to forest fraction, maximal multiyear snow depth, topographic parameters, and long-term average wind speed across both individual sensor time series and a merged multi-sensor dataset. In regions where forest cover is extensive, it is the strongest control on SWE variability. In those regions where forest density is low (<5%), maximal snow depth dominates the uncertainty signal. In our regression across HMA, we find that forest fraction is the strongest control on SWE variability (75.8%), followed by maximal multi-year snow depth (7.82%), 90th percentile 10-m wind speed of a 10-year December-January-February (DJF) time series (5.64%), 25th percentile DJF 10-m wind speed (5.44%), and hillslope angle (5.24%). Elevation, relief, and terrain aspect show very low influence on SWE variability (<1%). We find that the GPM sensor provides the most robust regression results, and can be reliably used to estimate SWE in our study region.
   While forest cover and elevation have been integrated into many SWE algorithms, wind speed and long-term maximal snow depth have not. Our results show that wind redistribution of snow can have impacts on SWE, especially over large, flat, areas. Using our regression results, we have developed an understanding of sensor specific SWE uncertainties and their spatial patterns. The uncertainty maps developed in this study provide a first-order approximation of SWE-estimate reliability for much of HMA, and imply that high-fidelity SWE estimates can be produced for many high-elevation areas.

AB Emissions estimates of anthropogenic methane (CH4) sources are highly uncertain and many sources related to energy production are localized yet difficult to quantify. Airborne imaging spectrometers like the next generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) are well suited for locating CH4 point sources due to their ability to map concentrations over large regions with the high spatial resolution necessary to resolve localized emissions. AVIRIS-NG was deployed during a field campaign to measure controlled CH4 releases at the Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) in Wyoming, U.S. for multiple flux rates and flight altitudes. Two algorithms were applied to AVIRIS-NG scenes, a matched filter detection algorithm and a hybrid retrieval approach using the Iterative Maximum a Posteriori Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (IMAP-DOAS) algorithm and Singular Value Decomposition. Plumes for releases as low as 14.16 m(3)/h (0.09 kt/year) were consistently observed by AVIRIS-NG at multiple flight altitudes and images of plumes were in agreement with wind directions measured at ground stations. In some cases plumes as low as 3.40 m(3)/h (0.02 kt/year) were detected, indicating that AVIRIS-NG has the capability of detecting a wide range of fugitive CH4 source categories for natural gas fields. This controlled release experiment is the first of its kind using AVIRIS-NG and demonstrates the utility of imaging spectrometers for direct attribution of emissions to individual point source locations. This is particularly useful given the large uncertainties associated with anthropogenic CH4 emissions, including those from industry, gas transmission lines, and the oil and gas sectors.

AB The annual spring breakup of river ice has important consequences for northern ecosystems and significant economic implications for Arctic industry and transportation. River ice breakup research is restricted by the sparse distribution of hydrological stations in the Arctic, where limited available data suggests a trend towards earlier ice breakup. The specific climatic mechanisms driving this trend, however, are complex and can vary both regionally and within river systems. Consequently, understanding the response of river ice processes to a warming Arctic requires simultaneous examination of spatial and temporal patterns in breakup timing. In this paper, we describe an automated algorithm for river ice breakup detection using MODIS satellite imagery that enables identification of spatial and temporal breakup patterns at large scales. We examine breakup timing on the Mackenzie, Lena, Ob' and Yenisey rivers for the period 2000-2014. By dividing the rivers into 10 km segments and classifying each river pixel in each segment as snow/ice, mixed ice/water or open water based on MODIS reflectance, we determine breakup dates with a mean uncertainty of +/- 13 days. All statistically significant temporal trends are negative, indicating an overall shift towards earlier breakup. Considerable variability in the statistical significance and magnitude of trends along each river suggests that different climatic and physiographic drivers are impacting spatial patterns in breakup. Trends detected on the lower Mackenzie corroborate recent studies indicating weakening ice resistance and earlier brealcup timing near the Mackenzie Delta. In Siberia, the increased magnitude of trends upstream and strong correlation between breakup initiation and whole-river breakup patterns suggest that earlier onset of upstream discharge may play the dominant role in determining breakup timing. Exploratory analysis demonstrates that MODIS imagery may also be used to differentiate thermal and mechanical breakup events. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Landslide inventory mapping (LIM) is an increasingly important research topic in remote sensing and natural hazards. Past studies achieve LIM mainly using on-screen interpretation of aerial photos, and little attention has been paid to developing more automated methods. In recent years, the use of multitemporal remote sensing images makes it possible to map landslides semi-automatically. Although numerous methods have been proposed, only a few methods are competent for some specific situations and there is large room for improvement in their degree of automation. For these reasons, a semi-automated approach is proposed for reliable and accurate LIM from bitemporal aerial orthophotos. Specifically, it consists of two principal steps: 1) change detection-based thresholding (CDT) and 2) level set evolution (LSE). CDT is mainly used to generate the initial zero-level curve (ZLC) for LSE, thus automating the proposed method considerably. It includes three substeps: 1) generating difference image (DI) using change vector analysis (CVA), 2) detecting landslide candidates using a thresholding method, and 3) removing errors using morphology operations. Then, landslide boundaries are detected using two types of LSE, i.e., edge-based LSE (ELSE) and region-based LSE (RISE). Finally, the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed methods are corroborated by a series of experiments. Given its efficiency and accuracy, it can be applied to rapid responses of natural hazards. This study is the first attempt to apply LSE to LIM from bitemporal remote sensing images.

AB A phytoplankton bloom covering an area >11,000 km(2) has been reported in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi River Delta in August 2010 (30 degrees-28 degrees N, 90 degrees-86 degrees W) based on NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) chlorophyll fluorescence line height (FLH) images. The bloom appeared to be anomalous relative to a historical monthly chlorophyll FLH mean (August 2002 to 2010), and was attributed by others to the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill accident. Here we tested an alternative hypothesis that the eastward dispersal of the Mississippi River plume entrained in wind-driven currents contributed to the development of this phytoplankton bloom. We examined Mississippi River discharge and nutrient records, ship-based surface salinity data, and the rime-series of MODIS ocean color and FLH images. Wind measurements from buoys showed winds >6 m s(-1) first in a southerly (northward) direction August 8-10, and then in a northerly (southward) direction until August 26. Results from the American Seas-Navy Coastal Ocean Model (AmSeas-NCOM) show how coastal water was advected in wind-driven currents into the area of the northeastern Gulf of Mexico where the bloom was documented.
   Between July 9 and September 8, 2010, the discharge of the Mississippi River exceeded the 20-year mean. During this time, the northeastern Gulf received an estimated excess volume of approximately 8.3 x 10(9) m(3) relative to the 20-year mean. Together with findings from a particle trajectory model, we conclude that nutrients and other materials (e.g., sediments) from the excessive discharge of the Mississippi River and adjacent marshes and wind-driven currents likely contributed to the anomalous bloom observed during August 2010 and to the anomalously high organic matter sedimentation rates observed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

AB The quantification of forest ecosystems is important for a variety of purposes, including the assessment of wildlife habitat, nutrient cycles, timber yield and fire propagation. This research assesses the estimation of forest structure, composition and deadwood variables from small-footprint airborne lidar data, both discrete return (DR) and full waveform (FW), acquired under leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. The field site, in the New Forest, UK, includes managed plantation and ancient, semi-natural, coniferous and deciduous woodland. Point clouds were rendered from the FW data through Gaussian decomposition. An area-based regression approach (using Akaike Information Criterion analysis) was employed, separately for the DR and FW data, to model 23 field-measured forest variables. A combination of plot-level height, intensity/amplitude and echo-width variables (the latter for FW lidar only) generated from both leaf-on and leaf-off point cloud data were utilised, together with individual tree crown (ITC) metrics from rasterised leaf-on height data. Statistically significant predictive models (p < 0.05) were generated for all 23 forest metrics using both the DR and FW lidar datasets, with R-2 values for the best fit models in the range R-2 = 0.43-0.94 for the DR data and R-2 = 028-0.97 for the FIN data (with normalised RMSE values being 18%-66% and 16%-48% respectively). For all but two forest metrics the difference between the NRMSE of the best performing DR and FW models was <= 7%, and there was an even split (11:12) as to which lidar dataset (DR or FW) generated the best model per forest metric. Overall, the DR data performed better at modelling structure variables, whilst the FW data performed better at modelling composition and deadwood variables. Neither showed a clear advantage at modelling variables from a particular vegetation layer (canopy, shrub or ground). Height, intensity/amplitude, and ITC-derived crown variables were shown to be important inputs across the best performing models (DR or FW), but the additional echo-width variables available from FW point data were relatively unimportant. Of perhaps greater significance to the choice between lidar data type (i.e. DR or FW) in determining the predictive power of the best performing models was the selection of leaf-on and/or leaf-off data. Of the 23 best models, 10 contained both leaf-on and leaf-off lidar variables, whilst 11 contained only leaf-on and two only leaf-off data. We therefore conclude that although FW lidar has greater vertical profile information than DR lidar, the greater complimentary information about the entire forest canopy profile that is available from both leaf-on and leaf-off data is of more benefit to forest inventory, in general, than the selection between DR or FW lidar.

AB This article describes a new algorithm to retrieve the atmospheric water vapour total column (TCWV) using the Thermal InfraRed (TIR) measurements from the two TIR channels of the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) instrument series, on board the European Space Agency's ERS-1, ERS-2 and ENVISAT satellites spanning 1991 to 2012. The use of the dual view capability of the ATSR-type instruments allows for the accurate and precise, day-rime and night-rime retrievals of cloud free TCWV over oceans. The retrieval scheme uses the instrument physical characteristics, in combination with advanced radiative transfer models and a sea surface spectral emissivity database. The retrievals therefore do not require algorithm tuning or adjustments to independent water vapour datasets.
   Inter-comparisons with the Remote Sensing Systems Special Sensor Microwave Imager (RSS SSM/I) and ECMWF ERA-Interim total water vapour column products have been carried out for a set of test cases and are discussed in detail. The initial results show that the ATSR TCWV data, aggregated at the SSMM/I or ECMWF spatial resolution, have no median bias with respect to the collocated datasets, and have an estimated precision of about 4% for the ATSR-2 and AATSR instruments and up to 15% for the ATSR-1 instrument. The TCWV precision for the 1 x 1 km(2) resolution is of the order of 12% for ATSR-2 and AATSR, while is about 30% for ATSR-1.
   This new physical algorithm can be readily extended to dual view radiometers similar to ATSR such as the upcoming Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument on the European Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite series. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mapping deforestation using medium spatial resolution satellite data (e.g. Landsat) is increasingly shifting from decadal and annual scales to sub-annual scales in recent years, but this shift has brought new challenges on how to account for seasonality in the satellite data when detecting deforestation. A seasonal model is typically used to account for seasonality, but fitting a seasonal model is difficult when there are not enough data in the time series. Here, we propose a new approach that reduces seasonality in satellite image time series using spatial context. With this spatial context approach, each pixel value in the image is spatially normalised using the median value calculated from neighbouring pixels whose pixel values are above the 90th percentile. Using Landsat data, we compared our spatial context approach to a seasonal model approach at a humid tropical forest in Brazil and a thy tropical forest with strong seasonality in Bolivia. After reducing seasonal variations in Landsat data, we detected deforestation from the same data using the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) method. We show that, in dry tropical forest, deforestation events are detected much earlier when the spatial context approach is used to reduce seasonal variations in Landsat data than when a seasonal model is used. In the dry tropical forest, the median temporal detection delay for deforestation from the spatial context approach was two observations, seven times shorter than the median temporal detection delay from the seasonal model approach (15 observations). In the humid tropical forest, the difference in the temporal detection delay between the spatial context and seasonal model approach was not significant. The differences in overall spatial accuracy between the spatial context and seasonal model were also not significant in both dry and humid tropical forests. The main benefit for using spatial context is early detection of deforestation events in forests with strong seasonality. Therefore, the spatial context approach we propose here provides opportunity to monitor deforestation events in dry tropical forests at sub-annual scales using Landsat data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB This work presents a detailed study of the dynamical processes triggering the occurrence of the two heavy dust storms which occurred between 18 and 22 March 2012 over the Middle East. The dynamics of this event are related to the coupling of subtropical jet and polar jet over the Saudi Arabia region, resulting in massive dust storm generation and dust transport through Rub' al Khali and the Persian Gulf to the UAE region. AOD and PM10, values showed a fourfold increase during the event reaching a maximum of 1.8 and 1653 mu g/m(3) respectively. The spatial extent of the dust storm is evident from high values of MODIS AOD (similar to 1.5) and OMI aerosol index (4.5) covering the entire Middle East. The total attenuated backscatter at 550 nm from CALLIPSO showed the vertical extent of dust up to 8 km. In addition, surface temperature showed a decrease of almost 15 degrees C during the event signifying the intensity of the dust storm. Aerosol radiative forcing estimates during the dust storm showed a cooling at the surface and warming in the atmosphere, with a maximum forcing value reaching up to similar to-210 Wm(-2) (185 Wm(-2)). Hence, it is evident from the present study that the dust layer caused an additional warming of similar to 150 Wm(-2) in the atmosphere over this region. The present event showcases the importance of dust storm induced aerosol optical and physical processes, and associated atmospheric dynamics over UAE as well as other affected regions.

AB Satellite data are often used for their ability to fill in temporal and spatial patterns in data-sparse regions. It is also known that global satellite products generally contain more noise than ground-based estimates. Data validation of satellite data often treats ground-based estimates as the 'gold standard': without error or uncertainty. In the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) however, ground-based estimates have considerable uncertainty, caused by the input components of the ET equations. This research presents an analysis of uncertainty of reference ET (ET0) caused by these input components. A dataset of correlated random variables is generated for a country with a diverse climate and diverse density of ground observations: New Zealand. The uncertainty analysis shows that: ET() is most sensitive to temperature, followed by solar radiation, relative humidity, and cloudiness ratio; and that uncertainty varies between 10% and 40% of ET0, and depends on the ET0 value. Using this uncertainty analysis, a set of correlated random variables, and a Monte-Carlo fitting approach, MOD16 satellite PET data becomes a 'soft interpolator' between ground-based ET0 estimates. The resulting 1 km x I km monthly nation-wide dataset has the advantage of: taking into account land cover and vegetation characteristics through the use of satellite data; still abiding to local climate diversity and locally used standards through the use of ground-based estimates; and containing an uncertainty estimate. Further comparison suggests that original MOD16 satellite PET could estimate real PET better than using ground-based estimates of ET0. Further research recommends combination with other existing gridded ET estimates, and further validation of real PET estimates. (C) 2015 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Remotely sensed data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) can greatly improve the precision of estimates of forest resource parameters such as mean biomass and biomass change per unit area. Field plots are typically used to construct models that relate the variable of interest to explanatory variables derived from the remotely sensed data. The models may then be used in combination with the field plots to provide estimates for a geographical area of interest with corresponding estimates of precision using model-assisted estimators. Previous studies have shown that field plot sizes found suitable for pure field surveys may be sub-optimal for use in combination with remotely sensed data. Plot boundary effects, co-registration problems, and misalignment problems favor larger plots because the relative impact of these effects on the models of relationships may decline by increasing plot size. In a case study in a small boreal forest area in southeastern Norway (852.6 ha) a probability sample of 145 field plots was measured twice over an 11 year period (1998/1999 and 2010). For each plot, field measurements were recorded for two plot sizes (200 m(2) and 300/400 m2). Corresponding multitemporal ALS (1999 and 2010) and InSAR data (2000 and 2011) were also available. Biomass for each of the two measurement dates as well as biomass change were modeled for all plot sizes separately using explanatory variables from the ALS and InSAR data, respectively. Biomass change was estimated using model-assisted estimators. Separate estimates were obtained for different methods for estimation of change, like the indirect method (difference between predictions of biomass for each of the two measurement dates) and the direct method (direct prediction of change). Relative efficiency (RE) was calculated by dividing the variance obtained for a pure field-based change estimate by the variance of a corresponding estimate using the model-assisted approach. For ALS, the RE values ranged between 7.5 and 15.0, indicating that approximately 7.5-15.0 as many field plots would be required for a pure field-based estimate to provide the same precision as an ALS-assisted estimate. For InSAR, RE ranged between 1.8 and 2.5. The direct estimation method showed greater REs than the indirect method for both remote sensing technologies. There was clearly a trend of improved RE of the model-assisted estimates by increasing plot size. For ALS and the direct estimation method RE increased from 9.8 for 200 m(2) plots to 15.0 for 400 m(2) plots. Similar trends of increasing RE with plot size were observed for InSAR. ALS showed on average 32-6.0 times greater RE values than InSAR. Because remote sensing can contribute to improved precision of estimates, sample plot size is a prominent design issue in future sample surveys which should be considered with due attention to the great benefits that can be achieved when using remote sensing if the plot size reflects the specific challenges arising from use of remote sensing in the estimation. That is especially the case in the tropics where field resources may be scarce and inaccessibility and poor infrastructure hamper field work. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Epidemiological and health impact studies of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) have been limited in China because of the lack of spatially and temporally continuous PM2.5 monitoring data. Satellite remote sensing of aerosol optical depth (ADD) is widely used in estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. We improved the method for estimating long-term surface PM2.5 concentrations using satellite remote sensing and a chemical transport model, and derived PM2.5 concentrations over China for 2006-2012. We generated a map of surface PM2.5 concentrations at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees over China using the nested-grid GEOS-Chem model, most recent bottom-up emission inventory, and satellite observations from the MODIS and MISR instruments. Aerosol vertical profiles from the space-based CALIOP lidar were used to adjust the climatological drivers of the bias in the simulated results, and corrections were made for incomplete sampling. We found significant spatial agreement between the satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations and the ground-level PM2.5 measurements collected from literatures (r = 0.74, slope = 0.77, intercept = 1121 mu g/m(3)). The population-weighted mean of PM2.5 concentrations in China is 71 mu g/m(3) and more than one billion people live in locations where PM2.5 concentrations exceed the World Health Organization Air Quality Interim Target-1 of 35 mu g/m(3). The results from our work are substantially higher than previous work, especially in heavily polluted regions. The overall population-weighted mean uncertainty over China is 17.2 mu g/m(3), as estimated using ground-level AOD measurements and vertical profiles observed from CALIOP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) or plant area index (PAI) are commonly used to represent canopy structure and dynamics, but daily estimation of these variables using traditional ground-based methods is impractical and prone to multiple errors during data acquisition and processing. Existing terrestrial laser scanners can provide accurate representation of forest canopy structure, but the sensors are expensive, data processing is complex, and measurements are typically confined to a single event, which severely limits their utility in the interpretation of canopy trends indicated by remotely sensed data. We tested a novel, low-cost terrestrial laser scanner for its capacity to provide reliable and successive assessments of canopy PAL in an evergreen eucalypt forest. Daily scans comprised of 920 range measurements were made by three scanners at one forest site over a two-year period, providing mostly consecutive estimates of PAI, and of vertical structure profiles (as Plant Area Volume Density, PAVD). Data filtering, involving objective statistical methods to identify outliers, indicated that scan quality was adversely affected by moist weather and moderate wind speeds (>4 m s(-1)), suggesting limited utility in some forest environments. Data cleaning (associated with sensor malfunctions) plus filtering removed 32 to 49% of scans, leaving on average 57% of data over the two-year period. Nonetheless, we found strong agreement between lidar-derived PAI estimates, and those from monthly hemispherical images ( 0.1 PAI); with both methods indicating mostly stable PAI over multiple seasons. The PAVD profiles from the laser scanner indicated that leaf flush in the upper canopy concomitantly balanced leaf loss from the middle canopy in summer, which was consistent with measured summer peaks in litter fall. This clearly illustrated the advantages of three-dimensional lidar data over traditional two-dimensional PAI estimates in monitoring tree phenology, and in interpreting changes in canopy reflectance as detected by air- and space-borne remotely sensed data.

AB We investigate the characteristics of regolith through the application of statistical learning to diverse layers of terrestrial, continental-scale remote sensing data. This combination allows us to explore the multiple influences of bedrock, climate, biota, landscape and time on regolith development and properties: an interdisciplinary geoscience modeling problem. From a wide variety of available data for Australia, we select remotely sensed geophysical, geomorphological and mineralogical inputs with good spatial coverage. We use Self-Organizing Maps (SOM), a topologically constrained unsupervised statistical learning algorithm, to characterize the geophysical and mineralogical signatures of regolith and bedrock. Regolith materials cover more than 80% of the Australian continent, range in age from Precambrian to Quaternary and vary in thickness from less than a meter to more than a kilometer. The diversity of regolith cover type and character across Australia provides an opportunity to demonstrate knowledge discovery from remote sensing data. The outputs of our SOM analysis are combined with ground observations from locations showing naturally occurring anomalous concentrations of nickel, tin and uranium. We identify a minimum number of natural clusters indicating subtle but significant differences in regolith and bedrock mineralization characteristics. Our results show that SOM identifies spatially contiguous regions representing unique regolith and bedrock materials. In the Yilgarn Craton we observe key differences in landscape character, density of the crust, and relative abundance of radioactive elements and alumino-silicate and ferric oxide minerals. These properties discriminate between nickel-prospective residual deeply weathered regolith formed on mafic and/or ultramafic bedrock and uranium-prospective Cainozoic paleochannels containing felsic bedrock source materials. National-scale data are publicly available for many continental regions, as in the Australian example, and our approach has general applicability. We demonstrate that remote sensing data may be used to understand the regolith, revealing the interplay between environmental history and bedrock character at regional scales, and differences between residual and transported regolith, provenance of source materials and their relative ages.

AB Major earthquakes in mountainous areas often trigger rapid landslides. Some observations also suggest that earthquakes can damage landslide prone areas or cause slow-moving landslides to accelerate, with a risk of evolution to rapid landslides in the following months after the earthquake. Here, we use optical images from the Pleiades satellites to detect slow-moving landslides and quantify the effect of earthquakes on the landslide motion. We process multi-temporal Pleiades images acquired in March, April, and July 2013 over an area of 210 km(2) in the Colca valley (South Peru), to obtain two Digital Elevation Models (DEM) and three displacement fields of the area. The processed DEMs have an uncertainty of 0.6 m (1 sigma), an order of magnitude better than two global and freely available DEMs (GDEM-v2 and SRTM), whereas the displacement fields have an uncertainty of between 0.11 and 0.18 m (1 alpha) in both horizontal directions. Using these data, we detect 9 slow-moving landslides and compare their velocities during the March-April and April-July periods. We find that landslide velocities are highest during the wet season, which suggests a strong groundwater control, and we also highlight a landslide acceleration caused by a regional Mw 6.0 earthquake. The major parameters controlling the acceleration of the slow-moving landslides are the rock type and the distance to the source, suggesting that friction at the basal interface in the weeks after the earthquake is dependent on the shaking intensity.

AB Accurate estimation of the terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) for each plant functional type (PET) at high spatial and temporal scales remains a major challenge. We developed a satellite-based hybrid algorithm to determine the Priestley-Taylor (PT) parameter for estimating global terrestrial LE across multiple biomes. The hybrid algorithm combines a simple empirical equation with physically based ecophysiological constraints to obtain the sum of the weighted ecophysiological constraints (f(e)) from satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ground-measured air temperature (TO, relative humidity (RH), vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and LE for 2000 to 2009 provided by 240 globally distributed FLUXNET eddy covariance (ECOR) tower sites. Cross-validation analysis indicated that the optimization at a PFT level performed well with a RMSE of less than 0.15 and a R-2 between 0.61 and 0.88 for estimated monthly f(e). Cross-validation analysis also revealed good performance of the hybrid-based PT method in estimating seasonal variability with a RMSE of the monthly LE varying from 43 W/m(2) (for 6 deciduous needleleaf forest sites) to 18.1 W/m(2) (for 34 crop sites) and with a R-2 of more than 0.67. The algorithm's performance was also good for predicting among-site and inter-annual variability with a R-2 of more than 0.78 and 0.70, respectively. We implemented the global terrestrial LE estimation from 2003 to 2005 for a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees by recalibrating the coefficients of the hybrid algorithm using Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) meteorological data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI product and ground-measured LE. This simple but accurate hybrid algorithm provides an alternative method for mapping global terrestrial LE, with a performance generally improved as compared to other satellite algorithms that are not calibrated with tower. The calibrated f(e) differs for different PFTs, and all driving forces of the algorithm can be acquired from satellite and meteorological observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land cover information plays an elementary role for regional water and land management, and is an essential variable for the assessment of ecosystem services and regional climate impact. This paper describes the generation of a regionally optimized land cover dataset for West Africa with a spatial resolution of 250 m, which is based on earth observation data from three optical and radar instruments. The choice of sensors is based on their individual strengths and weaknesses in assessing specific land surface types. Annual profiles of the optical Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are analyzed for the classification of vegetated classes including agriculture. The classification approach builds on random forest classification with learning data extracted from higher resolution land cover maps. Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) Wide Swath (WS) time series are used, in combination with MODIS data, to delineate permanent and seasonal water bodies. Here, an approach integrating threshold classification and morphological operations is applied. Built-up areas of different densities are identified based on a seamless coverage of radar imagery collected by the satellites TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X. The detection of settlements is based on an unsupervised classification scheme which exploits texture metrics and backscattering amplitudes of the fine resolution radar sensors. The accuracy assessment of the multi-sensor land cover map yields an overall accuracy of 80% at legend level 1 (9 classes) and 73% at the more detailed legend level 2 (14 classes). Comparisons with available wall-to-wall datasets of the region demonstrate the valuable information content of the presented West African land cover map. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Barren ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus) herds experience significant fluctuations in abundance through time. A proposed hypothesis for these fluctuations involves the overgrazing of vegetation on herd summer ranges at high herd densities resulting in a reduction in available forage. Semi-domesticated reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) herds in Scandinavia negatively affect vegetation productivity at high herd densities and exclosure experiments have indicated that overgrazing may also affect barren ground caribou herds. However, overgrazing of summer range vegetation has yet to be tested at the landscape level or related to herd densities for barren ground caribou herds. Accordingly, the question examined in this study was does barren ground caribou herd density have an effect on summer range vegetation productivity? To answer this question, summer home ranges for four herds in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, Canada, were delineated using caribou telemetry data. Yearly overall productivity and vegetation seasonality (the change between the maximum and minimum productivity throughout the year) metrics were calculated by year using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data and related to herd densities. Overall vegetation productivity was negatively related to herd density, indicating that some summer range degradation may have occurred at high densities. Conversely, and contrary to our expectations, vegetation seasonality was positively related to herd density. The Bathurst herd, which experienced densities more than three times those of the other herds examined, had the least negative association with overall productivity. Given the negative relationship detected between each herd's densities and overall vegetation productivity, it is likely that some summer range degradation occurred as herd densities increased. Considering the results of the Bathurst herd however, it is difficult to conclude that overgrazing has been a major factor governing herd abundance in the herds examined here. This study demonstrated the utility of archived remotely sensed productivity data and how productivity indices can be useful tools for providing information on large mammal grazing impacts.

AB A number of global and regional maps of forest extent are available, but when compared spatially, there are large areas of disagreement. Moreover, there is currently no global forest map that is consistent with forest statistics from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). By combining these diverse data sources into a single forest cover product, it is possible to produce a global forest map that is more accurate than the individual input layers and to produce a map that is consistent with FAO statistics. In this paper we applied geographically weighted regression (GWR) to integrate eight different forest products into three global hybrid forest cover maps at a 1 km resolution for the reference year 2000. Input products included global land cover and forest maps at varying resolutions from 30 m to 1 km, mosaics of regional land use/land cover products where available, and the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product. The GWR was trained using crowdsourced data collected via the Geo-Wiki platform and the hybrid maps were then validated using an independent dataset collected via the same system. Three different hybrid maps were produced: two consistent with FAO statistics, one at the country and one at the regional level, and a "best guess" forest cover map that is independent of FAO. Independent validation showed that the "best guess" hybrid product had the best overall accuracy of 93% when compared with the individual input datasets.

AB Agricultural land use change substantially affects climate, water, ecosystems, biodiversity, and human welfare. In recent decades, due to increasing population and food demand and the backdrop of global warming, croplands have been expanding into higher latitude regions. One such hotspot is paddy rice expansion in northeast China. However, there are no maps available for documenting the spatial and temporal patterns of continuous paddy rice expansion. In this study, we developed an automated, Landsat-based paddy rice mapping (Landsat-RICE) system that uses time series Landsat images and a phenology-based algorithm based on the unique spectral characteristics of paddy rice during the flooding/transplanting phase. As a pilot study, we analyzed all the available Landsat images from 1986 to 2010 (498 scenes) in one tile (path/row 113/27) of northeast China, which tracked paddy rice expansion in epochs with five-year increments (1986-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2005, and 2006-2010). Several maps of land cover types (barren land and built-up land; evergreen, deciduous and sparse vegetation types; and water-related land cover types such as permanent water body, mixed pixels of water and vegetation, spring flooded wetlands and summer flooded land) were generated as masks. Air temperature was used to define phenology timing and crop calendar, which were then used to select Landsat images in the phenology-based algorithms for paddy rice and masks. The resultant maps of paddy rice in the five epochs were evaluated using validation samples from multiple sources, and the overall accuracies and Kappa coefficients ranged from 84 to 95% and 0.6-0.9, respectively. The paddy rice area in the study area substantially increased from 1986 to 2010, particularly after the 1990s. This study demonstrates the potential of the Landsat-RICE system and time series Landsat images for tracking agricultural land use changes at 30-m resolution in the temperate zone with single crop cultivation.

AB In semi-arid Mediterranean areas, the snow in the mountains represents an important source of water supply for many people living downstream. This study assessed the daily MODIS fractional snow-covered area (FSC) products over seven catchments with a mixed snow-rain hydrological regime, covering the Atlas chain in Morocco. For this purpose, more than 4760 daily MODIS tiles (MOD10A1 version 5) from September 2000 to June 2013 were processed, based on a spatio-temporal filtering algorithm aiming at reducing cloud coverage and the problem of discrimination between snow and cloud. The number of pixels identified as cloudy was reduced by 96% from 22.6% to 0.8%. In situ data from five snow stations were used to investigate the relative accuracy of MODE snow products. The overall accuracy is equal to 89% (with a 0.1 m. threshold for snow depth). The timing of the seasonal snow was also correctly detected with 11.4 days and 9.4 days of average errors with almost no bias for onset and ablation dates, respectively. The comparison of the FSC products to a series of 15 clear sky FORMOSAT-2 images at 8 m resolution in the Rheraya sub-basin near to Marrakech showed a good correlation of the two datasets (r = 0.97) and a reasonable negative bias of -27 km(2). Finally, the FSC products were analyzed through seasonal indicators including onset and melt-out dates, the Snow Cover Duration (SCD) and the maximum snow cover extent (SCAmax) at the catchment level: (1) the dynamic of the snow cover area is characterized by a very strong inter-annual signal with a variation coefficient of the SCAmax reaching 77%; (2) there is no evidence of a statistically significant long-term trend although results have pointed out that the SCD increased in February-March and, to a lesser extent, decreased in April-May for the 2000-2013 period. The study concludes that the daily MODIS product can be used with reasonable confidence to map snow cover in the South Mediterranean area despite difficult detection conditions.

AB Absorption coefficients for mineral particles and phytoplankton cells in the 488 nm waveband, a(mss)(488) and a(cHL)(488), and euphotic zone depths, z(1%pAR), were determined for the Irish Sea and St. George's Channel from 8 years of MODIS remote sensing reflectance observations. The results are presented as composite maps of the entire region for the months of January, April, July and October and as time series averaged over 2 week intervals for three selected locations representing different mixing regimes. Annual cycles in a(mss)(488) were observed in most areas, with maximum values occurring in winter when increased vertical mixing brought fine sediments to the surface. Euphotic depths were strongly influenced by a(mss)(488) cycles, but sharp reductions were superimposed wherever phytoplankton blooms occurred. A key hydrographic feature of this region is the formation of a front in St. George's Channel between mixed and seasonally stratified water bodies. On the mixed side of the front, single peaks in a(cHL).(488) were observed in summer when the euphotic zone was at its deepest. On the stratified side, double peaks in a(cHL)(488) occurred in spring and autumn while low summer values of a(cHL)(488) coincided with high values of Z(1%pAR). The remote sensing evidence indicates, therefore, that phytoplankton growth (as reflected by net accumulation at the surface) in summer was limited by light availability in mixed waters, and nutrient availability in the stratified region. We conclude that observations of spatio-temporal patterns in phytoplanIcton and mineral particle absorption coefficients and euphotic depths derived from ocean colour sensors can provide insights into the processes determining the depth of penetration of solar radiation, and also the factors limiting near-surface primary production, in optically complex and spatially heterogeneous shelf seas.

AB State of the art reviews of remote sensing change detection are becoming increasingly complicated and disparate due to an ever growing list of techniques, algorithms and methods. To provide a clearer, synoptic view of the field this review has organised the literature by the unit of analysis and the comparison method used to identify change. This significantly reduces the conceptual overlap present in previous reviews giving a succinct nomenclature with which to understand and apply change detection workflows. Under this framework, several decades of research have been summarised to provide an overview of current change detection approaches. Seven units of analysis and six comparison methods were identified and described highlighting the advantages and limitations of each within a change detection workflow. Of these, the pixel and post-classification change methods remain the most popular choices. In this review we extend previous summaries and provide an accessible description of the field. This supports future research by placing a clear separation between the analysis unit and the change classification method. This separation is then discussed, providing guidance for applied change detection research and future benchmarldng experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle as a carbon sink Deforestation and degradation of forests lead to carbon emissions, which should be prevented or minimized by protecting forests. Radar remote sensing has proven to be particularly useful to monitor forests especially in the tropics due to weather and daytime independence. Radar data from the TanDEM-X mission provide a potential opportunity to monitor large areas of tropical forests due to the multi-temporal global coverage and the high resolution.
   Tropical peat swamp forests are difficult to access and thus high effort to conduct field measurements is necessary. Therefore, aboveground biomass was estimated from a limited amount of in-situ measurements of relatively undisturbed peat swamp forest and a LiDAR based canopy height model to achieve a representative amount of biomass estimates for radar analysis. The LiDAR and field measurements resulted in an identical estimate of mean biomass and thus provided a reliable source to correlate with SAR (synthetic aperture radar) features from the TanDEM-X mission and ultimately up-scale the found relation to the entire study site.
   The relationship of interferometric coherence of the bistatic TanDEM-X data showed a moderate to high correlation with the biomass (R-2 = 05) and RMSE of 53 t/ha corresponding to a biomass range from 183 to 495 t/ha. Thus, it could be used to indicate forest degradation areas, which are characterized by larger opening of the canopy cover and thus lower biomass. The results indicate that interferometric coherence is useful for quantification of aboveground biomass in tropical peat swamp forest TanDEM-X coherence can at minimum serve as a stratification to assess spatial distribution of qualitative biomass classes in the context of REDD + monitoring, reporting, and verification schemes and for the identification of forest degradation areas.

AB Phycocyanin primarily exists in freshwater cyanobacteria. Accurate estimation of low phycocyanin concentration (PC) is critical for issuing an early warning of potential risks of cyanobacterial population growth to the public. To monitor cyanobacterial biomass in eutrophic inland waters, an approach is proposed to partition non-water absorption coefficient (a(t-w)(lambda)) into the contribution of colored dissolved matter (CDM), non-phycocyanin pigments, and phycocyanin with the aim of improving the accuracy in remotely estimated PC, in particular for low PC. The proposed algorithm extends the IOP Inversion Model of Inland Waters (IIMIW) that derives a(t-w)(lambda) and chlorophyll-a concentration from remote sensing reflectance. The extended IIMNV retrieves absorption spectra of both CDM (a(cdm)(lambda)) and phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)) with R-2 >= 0.80 and a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) <= 31.79% for a(cdm)(412), a(ph)(443), a(ph)(620), and a(ph)(665) when validated with data collected in 2010 from three Indiana reservoirs. In fact, comparison of our algorithm with other partitioning models demonstrates the new algorithm to be more suitable for inland waters. The algorithm also achieved more accurate PC estimation with R-2 = 0.81, rRMSE = 33.60%, and mean relative error (RE) = 49.11% than the widely used semi-empirical algorithm with R-2 = 0.73, rRMSE = 45.09%, and mean RE = 182.29% for the same dataset The validation of our algorithm against the data collected in other years shows that the proposed algorithm worked for a wide range of limnological conditions. In particular, low PC (PC <= 50 mg m(-3)) values of for all datasets used in this study were well predicted by the proposed algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Imaging spectroscopy (IS) provides an efficient tool to assess vegetation status and functioning at ecologically relevant scales. Reliable extraction of vegetation information from spatial and spectral high resolution spectroscopy data requires accurate retrieval schemes to account for the complex radiative transfer in the coupled vegetationatmosphere system. Particularly the coupling of the atmosphere and vegetation considering combined effects of anisotropy, absorption and scattering typically relies on many assumptions, rendering estimates of direct (E-dir) and diffuse (E-dif) surface irradiance error prone. This impacts the reliability of retrieved vegetation properties. In this study we discuss and quantify the retrieval sensitivity of vegetation information using high resolution IS data to inaccurate assumptions of direct and diffuse surface irradiance. We use observations and simulations and focus on the two vegetation indices normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), and on sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (Fs). Our results indicate that, even if the irradiance field (E) is exactly known, reflectance based vegetation indices show an inherent variation of 9% (NDVI) and 12% (PRI) respectively. These variations are caused by complex interactions of surface irradiance and reflectance anisotropy. The emitted Fs signal was found to be almost unaffected by those variations, if the retrieval considers surface anisotropy. Further, estimation of vegetation properties is subject to large uncertainties if instantaneous E fields are unknown. In that case, they range up to 13% for the NDVI, up to 32% for the PRI, and up to 58% for Fs. We conclude that retrieval sensitivities of vegetation indices and Fs to illumination effects must be carefully considered in data interpretation and suggest using coupled surface-atmosphere models to exploit the full information content of IS data.

AB Remote sensing offers the potential to study forest ecosystems by providing spatially and temporally distributed information on key biophysical and biochemical variables. The estimation of biochemical constituents of leaves from remotely sensed data is of high interest revealing insight on photosynthetic processes, plant health, plant functional types, and species composition. However, upscaling leaf level observations to canopy level is not a trivial task, in particular due to the inherent structural complexity of forests. A common solution for scaling spectral information is the use of physically-based radiative transfer models. We parameterize the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model based on airborne and in situ measurements. At-sensor radiances were simulated and compared with measurements of the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) imaging spectrometer. The study was performed on the Laegern site (47 degrees 28'43.0 N, 8 degrees 21'53.2 E, Switzerland), a temperate mixed forest characterized by steep slopes, a heterogeneous spectral background, and a high species diversity. Particularly the accurate 3D modeling of the complex canopy architecture is crucial to understand the interaction of photons with the vegetation canopy and its background. Two turbid medium based forest reconstruction approaches were developed and compared; namely based on a voxel grid and based on individual tree detection. Our study shows that the voxel grid based reconstruction yields better results. When using a pixel-wise comparison with the imaging spectrometer data, the voxel grid approach performed better (R-2 = 0.48, lambda 780 nm) than the individual tree approach (R-2 = 0.34, lambda 780 nm). Spatial patterns as compared to APEX data were similar, whereas absolute radiance values differed slightly, depending on wavelength. We provide a successful representation of a 3D radiative regime of a temperate mixed forest, suitable to simulate most spectral and spatial features of imaging spectrometer data. Limitations of the approach include the high spectral variability of leaf optical properties between and within species, which will be further addressed. The results also reveal the need of more accurate parameterizations of small-scale structures, such as needle clumping at shoot level as well as leaf angle. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study evaluates SMOS (soil moisture and ocean salinity) soil moisture products against a newly established soil moisture network in the central Tibetan Plateau. Based on the results, the validity of assimilating the SMOS soil moisture retrievals into a land surface model is further evaluated. The ground truth is obtained by spatial upscaling from the network measurements within an area of approximately 10,000 km(2). Results show that both SMOS L2 and the preliminary version of L3 soil moisture products have large biases at the SMOS node scales (15 and 25 km), but they can reflect the surface wetness conditions well when averaged at a 100-km scale during the unfrozen season (June to October). This finding indicates the applicability of SMOS retrievals is scale-dependent. Meanwhile, very few retrievals are available in winter due to the presence of frozen soil and snow cover, and the accuracy of ascending retrievals degrades during transition when diurnal freezing-thawing cycle occurs. Considering the SMOS L2 product has a better accuracy than that of 13, we assimilate it into a land surface model using a dual-pass land data assimilation scheme. The data assimilation estimate without insitu tuning proves superior to either remote sensing or land surface modeling in estimating surface soil moisture for the unfrozen season, and its accuracy fulfills the SMOS measurement requirements (RMSD <= 0.04 m(3) m(-3)). Thus, the assimilation of SMOS retrievals holds promise to produce regional soil moisture dataset with acceptable accuracy for the Tibetan Plateau semi-arid region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Forest mapping based on remote sensing data usually relies on purely spectral information ignoring that the observed signal may be substantially influenced by angular effects. On the other hand, it is known that for forest canopies the variation of reflectance with the sun-view-geometry is significant. The study examines different approaches to extract spectro-directional information from airborne imagery and explores its use in forest type classification. The images were acquired in a standard aerial survey. They were taken with a common forward and side overlap with the result that each point on the ground is observed from several view directions.
   To obtain directional information that might be useful in forest type classification, two widely used semi-empirical models of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) were tested, i.e., the Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete model (RPV; with 3 and 4 parameters) (Rahman et al., 1993) and the RossThick-LiSparse model (RTLS; with 3 and 5 parameters) (Wanner et al., 1995). For each sample plot, observations from at least 10 view directions were available. The models were inverted against the observations applying a look-up table approach. The estimated model parameters were used 1) directly as explanatory variables in the classification, and 2) to estimate the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) for selected sun-view-geometries, referred to as modeled BRFs. The BRFs also served as explanatory variables in the classification. For the classification the Random Forests classifier was used.
   Both models proved to provide information that can be successfully used in forest type classification outperforming conventional (single-angle) multi-spectral data. The 3-parameter version of the RPV model was found most effective. Compared to the conventional dataset, the overall classification accuracy increased from 72% (kappa: 0.64) to 85% (kappa: 0.81), when the parameters of this model were used as explanatory variables. The 4-parameter version of RPV and the 5-parameter version of RTLS fitted the observed data more accurately than the corresponding 3-parameter versions. However, the classification accuracies obtained with the estimated model parameters were significantly lower than those obtained with the 3-parameter models. All tested models yielded higher classification accuracies with the modeled BRFs than with the model parameters. Again, the highest classification accuracy was obtained with the RPV-3P model (overall accuracy: 92%; kappa: 0.89). The classification accuracy varied with the sun-view-geometry. These differences could partly be explained by the angular sampling scheme and partly by the models' capability to estimate the reflectance at angles that were not observed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB In this study we fused high-spatial resolution (3.7 m) hyperspectral imagery with 22 pulse/m(2) lidar data at the individual crown object scale to map 29 common tree species in Santa Barbara, California, USA. We first adapted and parallelized a watershed segmentation algorithm to delineate individual crowns from a gridded canopy maxima model. From each segment, we extracted all spectra exceeding a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold and a suite of crown structural metrics computed directly from the three-dimensional lidar point cloud. The variables were fused and crowns were classified using canonical discriminant analysis. The full complement of spectral bands along with 7 lidar-derived structural metrics were reduced to 28 canonical variates and classified. Species-level and leaf-type level maps were produced with respective overall accuracies of 83.4% (kappa = 82.6) and 93.5%. The addition of lidar data resulted in an increase in classification accuracy of 4.2 percentage points over spectral data alone. The value of the lidar structural metrics for urban species discrimination became particularly evident when mapping crowns that were either small or morphologically unique. For instance, the accuracy with which we mapped the tall palm species Washingtonia robusta increased from 29% using spectral bands to 71% with the fused dataset Additionally, we evaluated the role that automated segmentation plays in classification error and the prospects for mapping urban forest species not included in a training sample. The ability to accurately map urban forest species is an important step towards spatially explicit urban forest ecosystem assessment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite retrieved values of Land Surface Temperature (LST) over structured heterogeneous pixels generally depend on viewing and illumination angles as well as on the characteristics of the land cover. Here we present a method to quantify such dependencies on land surface characteristics, sun illumination and satellite position. The method uses a geometric model to describe the surface elements viewed by an air-borne sensor and relies on parallel-ray geometry to calculate the projections of tree canopies and sunlit and shaded ground: these are considered as basic surface elements responsible for most of the spatial variability of LST. For a woodland landscape we demonstrate that modeling the fractions of these basic surface elements within the sensor field-of-view allows us to quantify the directional effects observed on satellite LST with sufficient accuracy.
   Geometric models are an effective tool to upscale in situ measurements for the validation of LST over discontinuous canopies (e.g. forests). Here we present the application of a model to observations of brightness temperature from the LSA-SAF validation site in Evora (Portugal), an area of oak woodland, over the one-year period from October 2011 to September 2012. The resulting composite temperature is compared against LSA SAF LST products from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat as well as against MYD11A1/MOD11A1 (collection 5) products from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard AQUA and TERRA. Comparisons with modeled ground LST show that SEVIRI LST has a bias of 0.26 degrees C and a RMSE of 1.34 degrees C, whereas MODIS LST (MYD11A1 and MOD11A1, collection 5) has a bias of -1.54 degrees C and a RMSE of 2.37 degrees C. Both MODIS and SEVIRI LST are closer to in situ values obtained with the geometric model than to those obtained when disregarding the effects of viewing and illumination geometry. These results demonstrate the need to consider the directional character of LST products, especially for validation purposes over heterogeneous land covers. For the new MODIS LST product (MOD21), which is based on the Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm, comparisons with in-situ LST show an improved bias of 0.81 degrees C and a RMSE of 1.48 degrees C (daytime values only). The TES based product presents lower emissivity values than those used for retrieving MYD11A1/MOD11A1 LST, which may partially explain the improved match with in-situ LST.
   Discrepancies between LST retrievals obtained from different sensors, especially those on different orbits can also be partly explained by their viewing/illumination geometries. In this study the geometric model is used to correct LST deviations between simultaneous MODIS and SEVIRI LST estimations related to those effects. When the model is used to correct the variable MODIS viewing geometry there is a reduction in standard deviation of about 0.5 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate quantification of the spatio-temporal variation of gross primary production (GPP) for terrestrial ecosystems is significant for ecosystem management and the study of the global carbon cycle. In this study, we propose a MODIS-based Photosynthetic Capacity Model (PCM) to estimate GPP in Northern China and the Tibetan Plateau. The PCM follows the logic of the light use efficiency model and is only driven by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI). Multi-year eddy CO2 flux data from five vegetation types in North China (temperate mixed forest, temperate steppe) and the Tibetan Plateau (alpine shrubland, alpine marsh and alpine meadow-steppe) were used for model parameterization and validation. In most cases, the seasonal and interannual variation in the simulated GPP agreed well with the observed GPP. Model comparisons showed that the predictive accuracy of the PCM was higher than that of the MODIS GPP products and was comparable with that of the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) and the potential PAR-based GPP models. The model parameter (PCmax) of the PCM represents the maximum photosynthetic capacity, which showed a good linear relationship with the mean annual nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LSTan). With this linear function, the PCM-simulated GPP can explain approximately 93% of the variation in the flux-observed GPP across all five vegetation types. These analyses demonstrated the potential of the PCM as an alternative tool for regional GPP estimation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Motivated by a theory developed by Wilme et al. (2006) according to which, watersheds of Madagascar with headwaters at high altitude respond differently to drought from those with headwaters confined to relatively low elevations, with possibly profound effects on the biodiversity patterns of the island, we analyzed multi-year basin-specific observations of soil moisture and vegetation water content (derived from NRL's WindSat radiometer) and their response to precipitation departures (derived from TRMM 3B42 V7) from its local mean. These datasets were analyzed to investigate the hydrologic properties at the basin scale, including the speed with which vegetation and soil moisture respond to precipitation anomalies. We also looked at the basin-specific normalized radar surface-backscattering cross-sections from NASA's QuikSCAT Scatterometer, to obtain information on the vegetation regimes of the various Malagasy basins. Finally, we correlated the basin response to the precipitation forcing, and compared the amplitude and time lag of the correlations across watersheds with high elevation headwaters versus those with low elevation headwaters in the aim of evaluating the drought-response hypothesis of Wilme et al. (2006). Our results indicate that the vegetation water content time series exhibit several features that are consistent with those of the majority of the bioclimatic zones of the island. Specifically, although the speed of the response of the vegetation water content varies significantly among the different basins, it is inter-annually consistent for each watershed, while the soil-moisture time series are less consistent than the vegetation water content time series. This study is a first step in the quantification of the hydrologic properties derived from microwave remote sensing, and which could potentially shed new light on the different intra-annual responses of watersheds to precipitation anomalies. Furthermore, this analysis offers important insights into the hydro-geomorphologic drivers associated with biodiversity patterns in Madagascar, contributing to a better understanding of the mechanisms that determine biotic diversification across the various bioclimatic regions of the island.

AB Mapping aboveground carbon density (ACD) in tropical forests can enhance large-scale ecological studies and support CO2 emissions monitoring. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has proven useful for estimating carbon density patterns outside of field plot inventory networks. However, the accuracy and generality of calibrations between LiDAR-assisted ACD predictions (EACD(LiDAR)) and estimated ACD based on field inventory techniques (EACD(field)) must be increased in order to make tropical forest carbon mapping more widely available. Using a network of 804 field inventory plots distributed across a wide range of tropical vegetation types, climates and successional states, we present a general conceptual and technical approach for linking tropical forest EACD(field) to LiDAR top-of-canopy height (TCH) using regional-scale inputs of basal area and wood density. With this approach, we show that EACD(LiDAR) and EACD(field) reach nearly 90% agreement at 1-ha resolution for a wide array of tropical vegetation types. We also show that Lorey's Height - a common metric used to calibrate LiDAR measurements to biomass - is severely flawed in open canopy forests that are common to the tropics. Our proposed approach can advance the use of airborne and space-based LiDAR measurements for estimation of tropical forest carbon stocks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the face of global population growth and the uneven distribution of water supply, a better knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water resources is critical. Remote sensing provides a synoptic view of ongoing processes, which addresses the intricate nature of water surfaces and allows an assessment of the pressures placed on aquatic ecosystems. However, the main challenge in identifying water surfaces from remotely sensed data is the high variability of spectral signatures, both in space and time. In the last 10 years only a few operational methods have been proposed to map or monitor surface water at continental or global scale, and each of them show limitations. The objectives of this study are to develop, demonstrate and validate the adequacy of a generic multi-temporal and multi-spectral image analysis method to detect water surfaces automatically, and to monitor them in near real-time at the African continental scale as a first step towards global scale coverage. The proposed approach, based on a transformation of the RGB color space into HSV, provides dynamic information at the continental scale. Two different validations were done at the continental scale over Africa: i) The algorithm validation checked the ability of the proposed algorithm to perform as effectively as human interpretation of the image: it showed an accuracy of 96.6% and no commission errors. ii) The product validation was carried out by using an independent dataset derived from high resolution imagery: the continental permanent water surface product showed an accuracy of 91.5% and few commission errors. Potential applications of the proposed method have been identified and discussed. The methodology that has been developed is generic: it can be applied to sensors with similar bands with good reliability, and minimal effort. Moreover, this experiment at the African continental scale showed that the methodology is efficient for a large range of environmental conditions. Additional preliminary tests over other continents indicate that the proposed methodology could also be applied at the global scale without too many difficulties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is of primary importance in understanding global environment change, urban climatology, and land-atmosphere energy exchange. Analysis of long-term remotely sensed LST data remains a challenge for researchers. Most previous studies explored urban thermal pattern over space and time using a limited number of clear-sky images or by removing cloud-contaminated pixels. The limitation in the number of image scenes prevents from deriving long-term LST climatology for a particular region. Moreover, simply eliminating cloudy pixels inevitably obscures the spatial and temporal patterns of LST. This research attempts to characterize the annual and seasonal temperature behaviors during the period of year 2000 to year 2010 in Los Angeles by employing an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model. All 115 image scenes (path 41, row 36) of less than 30% of cloud cover available from the Landsat archive were utilized for the analysis. Three ATC parameters, i.e., mean annual surface temperature (MAST), yearly amplitude surface temperature (YAST), and the phase shift, were optimized with the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization scheme to understand the annual and seasonal characteristics of LST. The overall RMSE of 7.36 K was achieved for the optimization for all 115 images; while for the median monthly composite, the RMSE reached 2.85 K. The monthly median composite partly removed day-specific anomalies and the impact of cloud cover and reflected LSTs largely under clear sky conditions, leading to the improvement in the modeling result. The MAST and YAST derived from the modeling result of the monthly median composite data were further analyzed to relate to three normalized indices, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). The results showed that the mean temperature of urban areas in LA was as high as in the barren land area, reaching almost 310 K, but the urban areas possessed a less fluctuation. Seasonal analysis suggested that in winter, the urban areas observed a higher temperature than the barren land/desert, implying that urban materials held a larger amount of heat for a longer time than the barren land. The separation of cloudy scenes into cloud percentage groups made it possible for the evaluation of the effect of cloud cover on the ATC modeling process. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the inclusion of cloudy images brought about a decrease in MAST ranging from 0.18 to 2.0 K, depending on the percentage of cloud cover and the number of cloudy scenes used for the modeling. The decrease is due likely to the inclusion of cloud temperatures in analysis rather than shaded or other land surface temperatures. When all cloudy images were included in the modeling, a decrease of 2 K in MAST and an increase of 0.15 in YAST were observed. The regression analysis demonstrated that NDBI and NDVI were the main factors influencing the spatial variations of MAST and YAST with the R-2 value of 0.63 and 0.49, respectively. In addition, the spatial variation of VAST was found more complex than that of MAST, since the three indices can only explain up to 53% of its variance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Despite its size and importance the dispersal, variability and dynamics of the Congo River plume have until recently been minimally documented. In this paper we analyse remotely sensed sea surface temperature, sea level anomaly, salinity and chlorophyll concentration from 2010 to describe and quantify the extent, strength and seasonality of the plume and to explain its behaviour in relation to winds, ocean currents and fresh water discharge. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis reveals strong seasonal and coastal upwelling signals, potential bimodal seasonality and responses to fresh water discharge peaks in all data sets. Salinity and chlorophyll are significantly negatively correlated (-0.4 to -0.9) across a 500 km(2) zone west of the river mouth. Lagged correlations with river discharge show the westward translation, dispersal and strengthening of a similar sized region of positive chlorophyll-discharge and negative salinity-discharge correlations. Peaks in chlorophyll lag the discharge by 1-4 months, although it is not possible from ocean colour alone to distinguish increases in chlorophyll resulting from the dispersal of nutrient rich river discharge from other physical and biological mechanisms that promote changes in surface chlorophyll, or indeed have confidence that the signal has not been contaminated by other optically active substances. The strongest plume-like signatures from EOF analysis are found in the salinity and colour data sets, which are then also analysed using a statistically based water mass detection technique to isolate the behaviour of the plume. The validity of the technique is checked against ARGO profiles. Throughout the year the main axis of the fresh water plume extends between 400 and 1000 km, northwest along the coastline, or west southwest out into the open south Atlantic. Changes in the magnitude and direction of wind stress and hence wind driven surface currents are the principal driving force behind this far-field variability, although the strength and direction of the Angola and Benguela Coastal currents may also play a role. The mean surface salinity within the plume and its surface area have qualitative links to the seasonal cycle in river discharge and wind stress. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility to use surface soil moisture satellite products in order to correct precipitation estimates. The overall approaches are generally based on adjusting the precipitation rate into a water balance model in order to match observed and simulated soil moisture. In the present study, a recently proposed approach was improved and assessed over a 4-year period in West Africa. Three different satellite precipitation products (CMORPH, TRMM-3B42 and PERSIANN) were used in this study. The new algorithm was evaluated over three 0.25 x 0.25 degrees areas in Niger, Mali and Benin and precipitation estimates (before and after correction) were compared to observed ground-based precipitation measurements. An assessment was also conducted at the regional scale using 48 independent rainfall stations located in Togo, Niger and Burkina Faso. The proposed methodology showed that, after correction, the three satellite precipitation products converge to the ground-based precipitation measurements, demonstrating the robustness of the methodology. In addition, soil moisture estimates derived from the methodology were found to be in good agreement with ground-based soil moisture measurements (R-2 > 0.78 in Niger, R-2 > 0.54 in Mali and R-2 > 0.64 in Benin).

AB LiDAR has the potential to derive canopy structural information such as tree height and leaf area index (LAI), via models of the LiDAR signal. Such models often make assumptions regarding crown shape to simplify parameter retrieval and crown archetypes are typically assumed to contain a turbid medium to account for within-crown scattering. However, these assumptions may make it difficult to relate derived structural parameters to measurable canopy properties. Here, we test the impact of crown archetype assumptions by developing a new set of analytical expressions for modelling LiDAR signals. The expressions for three crown archetypes (cuboids, cones and spheroids) are derived from the radiative transfer solution for single order scattering in the optical case and are a function of crown macro-structure (height and crown extent) and LAI. We test these expressions against waveforms simulated using a highly-detailed 3D radiative transfer model, for LAI ranging from one to six. This allows us to control all aspects of the crown structure and LiDAR characteristics. The analytical expressions are fitted to both the original and the cumulative simulated LiDAR waveforms and the CV(RMSE) of model fit over archetype trees ranges from 03% to 21.2%. The absolute prediction error (APE) for LAI is 7.1% for cuboid archetypes, 18.6% for conical archetypes and 4.5% for spheroid archetypes. We then test the analytical expressions against more realistic 3D representations of broadleaved deciduous (birch) and evergreen needle-leaved (Sitka spruce) tree crowns. The analytical expressions perform more poorly (APE values up to 260.9%, typically ranging from 39.4% to 78.6%) than for the archetype shapes and ignoring clumping and lower branches has a significant influence on the performance of waveform inversion of realistic trees. The poor performance is important as it suggests that the assumption of crown archetypes can result in significant errors in retrieved crown parameters due to these assumptions not being met in real trees. Seemingly reasonable inferred values may arise due to coupling between parameters. Our results suggest care is needed in inferring biophysical properties based on crown archetypes. Relationships between the derived parameters and their physical counterparts need further elucidation. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Global, long-term monitoring of changes in Earth's land surface requires quantitative comparisons of satellite images acquired under widely varying atmospheric conditions. Although physically based estimates of surface reflectance (SR) ultimately provide the most accurate representation of Earth's surface properties, there has never been a globally consistent SR dataset at the spatial resolution (<1 ha) or temporal extent (similar to 40 years) of the Landsat mission. To increase the consistency and robustness of Landsat-based land cover monitoring, we atmospherically corrected the Global Land Survey (GLS) Landsat dataset using the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) implementation of the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum ( 6S) radiative transfer model. The GLS provides synoptic, orthorectified, cloud-free Landsat coverage of Earth's land area in four nominal epochs (1975, 1990, 2000, and 2005). This paper presents the resulting GLS surface reflectance dataset and a global assessment of the 2000- and 2005-epoch data against coincident Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily SR and Normalized Bidirectional Distribution Function-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) measurements. Agreement with respect to MODIS SR and NBAR data is very high, with overall discrepancies (Root-Mean-Squared Deviation (RMSD)) between 1.3 and 2.8 percent reflectance for Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ELM +) and between 2.2 and 3.5 percent reflectance for Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM). The resulting Landsat surface reflectance dataset and the associated quality metrics for each image are hosted on the Global Land Cover Facility web site for free download (http://www.landcover.org/data/gls_SR). This new repository will provide consistent, calibrated, multi-decadal image data for robust land cover change detection and monitoring across the Earth sciences. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB We consider night light as a type of consumer goods and propose a model for factors affecting the relationship between night lights and GDP. It is then decomposed into agricultural and non-agricultural productions. Further, the model is modified to determine how the factors affect residents' propensity to consume lights. Models are tested with time-fixed regression on a set of 15-year panel data of 169 countries globally and regionally. We find that light consumption propensity is affected by GDP per capita, latitude, spatial distribution of human activities and gross saving rate, and that light consumption per capita has an inverted-U relationship with GDP per capita.

AB An algorithm for the land aerosol and bidirectional reflectance inversion by times series technique (LABITS) is proposed and applied to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR). The surface reflectance and aerosol optical depth are inverted from AVHRR Channel 1 data using a model for the earth-atmosphere system which couples an atmospheric radiative transfer model with the Ross-Thick-Li-sparse bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) model. Basic assumptions are that the surface bidirectional reflective property does not vary over a 2-4 day periods and that the aerosol characteristics are uniform within a 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees window (approximately 10 km x 10 km). The LABITS algorithm is applied to data from AVHRR on the NOAA-15, NOAA-16, and NOAA-18 satellites over four distinct areas, namely, North America, Europe, the Sahara and India, to simultaneously retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD), BRF parameters and surface albedo. Preliminary results show that AOD and reflectance retrieved from the three different instruments are in good agreement and that LABITS provides good results over both bright surfaces, e.g. the Sahara, and dark surfaces, e.g. Europe. Evaluation of the AOD versus data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) provides a correlation coefficient R-2 of 0.88 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of approximately 0.07; and the uncertainty is approximately Delta tau= +/- 0.05 +/- 0.20 tau. Comparing our results with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD products, over many areas, provides biases in the range of +/- 0.05. The surface albedo values calculated from the retrieved BRF parameters are similar to those provided by the MODIS albedo product (MCD43). The robustness and applicability of the LABITS algorithm are demonstrated with the retrieval of AOD over China during August 2008. Daily and monthly averaged results show good agreement with collocated AERONET observations and AQUA MODIS products (MYD04 and MYD08). The AOD uncertainty is estimated as Delta tau = +/- 10.05 +/- 030 tau. The preliminary analysis of time series over selected AERONET sites shows that the temporal variations of the AOD values retrieved by application of LABITS to AVHRR data are overall similar to temporal variations of AOD provided by the MODIS and AERONET. The algorithm has the potential to retrieve global AOD over land for long time series of NOAA AVHRR data going back to the 1980s, which are urgently needed for studies on aerosol climatology and global climate change.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of land surface processes from local through global scales. The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from space. However, retrieving LST is still a challenging task since the LST retrieval problem is ill-posed. This paper reviews the current status of selected remote sensing algorithms for estimating LST from thermal infrared (TIR) data. A brief theoretical background of the subject is presented along with a survey of the algorithms employed for obtaining LST from space-based TIR measurements. The discussion focuses on TIR data acquired from polar-orbiting satellites because of their widespread use, global applicability and higher spatial resolution compared to geostationary satellites. The theoretical framework and methodologies used to derive the LST from the data are reviewed followed by the methodologies for validating satellite-derived LST. Directions for future research to improve the accuracy of satellite-derived LST are then suggested. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The meltwater released by the glaciers in the Aksu-Tarim Catchment, south of Tomur Peak (Central Tien Shan), feeds the Tarim River which is the main artery for the oases at the northern margin of the Taklamakan desert. The correct modeling of the contribution of the glaciers meltwater to the total runoff of the Tarim River is hampered by the lack of mass balance data. Multi-temporal digital terrain models (DTMs) allow the determination of volume changes for large samples of glacier. Here, we present the mass changes for 12 glaciers using 1976 KH-9 Hexagon, 2000 SRTM3 and 2009 SPOT-5 datasets. The results show that most of the glaciers have been losing mass since 1976. The largest glaciers, Koxkar and West Qongterang, lost -0.27+/-0.15 m w.e.a(-1) and -0.43+/-0.15 m w.e.a(-1) between 1976 and 2009, despite thick debris cover. However, some smaller glaciers show mass gain at their tongues indicating glacier surges. Using SRTM3 data the volume gain of Qinbingtan Glacier No. 74 could be dated to the time period 1999-2009. The overall mass budget of -0.33+/-0.15 m w.e.a(-1) (for 1976-2009) of the investigated glaciers is within the variability range of the global average. However, in the recent years (1999-2009) a slightly decelerated mass loss of -0.23+/-0.19 m w.e.a(-1) could be observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work it is demonstrated how the combination of multi-sensor and multi-temporal SAR data improves the monitoring capacity of very slow landslides. The study area is the Upper Tena Valley (Central Spanish Pyrenees), where mostly very slow earth flows, have caused direct damage estimated at approximately 15 ME in the last decade. The advanced DInSAR processing of ascending orbit ALOS PALSAR images (2006-2010) and descending orbit ERS & Envisat (2001-2007) and TerraSAR-X (2008) datasets, has provided heterogeneous displacement velocity measurements. The projection along the steepest slope of LOS displacements reduces the geometrical differences introduced by each satellite. These results were compared and validated with available D-GPS measurements. In a second step PS displacement data are combined with a landslide inventory, increasing the number of monitored landslides with sufficient PS from 4% to 19%, obtained from C- and X-band data, to 38% of the total (294). Finally, the retrieved multi-sensor landslides velocities are classified with respect to the magnitude of road damages that occurred in the 2008-2010 period. At local scale, the combination of multi-sensor data was useful to differentiate different landslide displacement directions, to measure different velocity patterns within the same moving mass, and to distinguish the slower (natural) and faster (human induced) landslides. The analysis of displacement time series permitted to evaluate the acceleration caused by a destabilising anthropogenic change, and the correlation between displacement variability and seasonal precipitation and melting.

AB The increasing availability of satellite imagery has spurred the production of thematic land cover maps based on satellite data. These maps are more valuable to the scientific community and land managers when the accuracy of their classifications has been assessed. Here, we assessed the accuracy of a map of forest disturbance in the watersheds of lake Superior and Lake Michigan based on an improved version of the Vegetation Change Tracker algorithm (VCTw). We constructed a probability-based sampling design using two stages of sampling with stratification at each stage. Results are presented for the portion of the map within the U.S. as well as separately for the U.S. portion of Lake Superior's watershed and for lake Michigan's watershed. We also present estimates and standard errors of the percent cover for each land cover class that incorporate both the map's data and our sample data. The overall accuracy for the U.S. portion of the map is estimated to be 91% with a standard error of 0.8%. We discuss the relative strengths of the VCTw algorithm as well as the dependence of such an algorithm's success on the characteristics of the landscape being mapped. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The advanced synthetic aperture radar (ASAR) on board the European Space Agency (ESA) Envisat satellite is an important resource for observation of global ocean surface wave spectra. The ESA retrieval procedure for the fast-delivery level 2 ASAR wave spectra has undergone an important update since October 2007. Testing the benefit of the new procedure against ground truth is not straightforward, due to a lack of other independent ocean wave spectral observations; however an indirect comparison of the ASAR wave spectra with altimeter and buoy observations is made possible via a wave model. In addition to the conventional significant wave height (SWH), four spectral sub-range wave heights (SRWHs) are used to illustrate the spectral characteristics of these observations. The indirect comparison is applied on the updated ASAR wave spectra for over one year (November 2007 to December 2008). Results indicate that the updated ASAR spectra are better than the pre-October 2007 data since the updated procedure removes erroneous long waves, and improves the treatment of short waves beyond the detection range of the instrument Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We describe a pragmatic approach for evaluating the spatial representativeness of flux tower measurements based on footprint climatology modeling analyses of land cover and remotely sensed vegetation indices. The approach was applied to the twelve flux sites of the Canadian Carbon Program (CCP) that include grassland, wetland, and temperate and boreal forests across an east-west continental gradient. The spatial variation within the footprint area was evaluated by examining the spatial structure of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land cover using geostatistical analyses of frequency distribution, variogram and window size. The results show that at most sites (i) the percentages of the target vegetation functional type (dominant land cover) observed by the CCP towers were higher than 60%; (ii) to some extent, most of the CCP sites presented anisotropically distributed patterns of NDVI in the 90% annual footprint climatology area; and (iii) the land surface heterogeneity within the flux footprint area differed among sites. Overall, the forest sites had larger fine-scale spatial variation than the grassland and wetland sites. The coniferous boreal forest sites had greater spatial variability than the two wetland sites and a coniferous temperate forest site. We conclude that the combination of footprint modeling, semivariogram and window size techniques, together with moderate spatial resolution remotely-sensed image data, is a pragmatic approach for assessing the spatial representativeness of flux tower measurements.

AB Sea surface signatures of short internal waves trailing strong internal solitary waves (ISWs) have been detected on several synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) onboard the European Envisat satellite over the northern South China Sea (SCS). Such configurations were found recently by Vlasenko et al. (2010) in numerical simulations carried out with the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm). They showed that the short internal waves, which have wavelengths of 1.5 km and amplitudes of 20 m, ride on second mode ISWs. The existence of these short internal waves, which follow a first mode ISW, can be explained in terms of the Taylor-Goldstein equation that includes a shear in the background current associated with a second mode ISW. The simulations predict that the short internal waves occur in two distinct areas, one close to the Luzon Strait (LS) and the other further west. In the first area, they are generated by the disintegration of a baroclinic bore, which is generated by the interaction of the tidal current with the steep two-ridged topography in the LS. In the second area, they are generated when the faster first mode ISW overtakes the second mode ISW of the previous tidal cycle. We have screened the ASAR archive of the European Space Agency (ESA) and found many SAR images acquired over the northern SCS showing sea surface signatures of such short internal waves trailing a much longer first mode strong ISW. The detailed analysis of six of these SAR images shows good correlation between modeled and observed internal wave fields. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Several studies have reported intensive phytoplankton blooms during the northeast monsoon season in the Luzon Strait and its vicinity (the "LZS bloom"); the primary mechanism underlying this phenomenon is however not yet clear. Here we investigated the January 2010 LZS bloom and climatological state using in situ and remote sensing data, including the MODIS phytoplankton absorption coefficient at 443 nm (Aph) as a preferable pigmentation index. Blooming patches of Aph >= 0.02 m(-1) overlaid on a background level of 0.01 m(-1) were discernible for both situations. A twin-core structure of the bloom was identified; the major core lay far offshore in the deep basin to the northwest of Luzon, with a maximum horizontal scale of similar to 250 km, and the other core was nearshore in the Babuyan Channel, with a maximum scale of similar to 100 km. Variations in climatological monthly mean Aph indicate that the LZS bloom as a whole persists from November to February, peaking in December. Further investigations with satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature suggest that the bloom is primarily associated with the Kuroshio and its intrusion, which generate various meso-scale processes and thus induce enhanced nutrient pumping/entrainment from depth when interacting with the topography of the Luzon Strait and the circulation of the northeastern South China Sea (i.e. the Luzon Gyre). Meanwhile, upwelling at the center of the Luzon Gyre contributes to the offshore bloom. The nearshore bloom is substantially enhanced by nutrient input from the Cagayan River. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB To retrieve microwave land emissivity, infrared surface skin temperatures have been used as surface physical temperature since there is no global information on physical vegetation/soil temperature profiles. However, passive microwave emissions originate from deeper layers with respect to the skin temperature. So, this inconsistency in sensitivity depths between skin temperatures and microwave temperatures may introduce a discrepancy in the determined emissivity. Previous studies showed that this inconsistency can lead to significant differences between day and night retrievals of land emissivity which can exceed 10%. This study proposes an approach to address this inconsistency and improve the retrieval of land emissivity using microwave observations from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). The diurnal cycle of the microwave brightness temperature (Tb) was constructed over the globe for different frequencies/polarizations using a constellation of satellites. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to evaluate the spatial variation of the Tb diurnal cycle. The diurnal amplitudes of microwave temperatures observed in desert areas were not consistent with the larger amplitudes of the diurnal cycle of skin temperature. Densely vegetated areas with more moisture have shown smaller amplitudes. A lookup table of effective temperature (T-eff) anomalies is constructed based on the Tb diurnal cycle to resolve the inconsistencies between infrared and Tb diurnal variation. This lookup table of T-eff anomalies is a weighted average over the layers contributing to the microwave signal, for each channel and month. The integration of this T-eff in the retrieval of land emissivity reduced the differences between day and night retrieved emissivities to less than 0.01 for AMSR-E observations.

AB A high precision geometric method for automated shoreline detection from Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery is presented. The methodology is based on the application of an algorithm that ensures accurate image geometric registration and the use of a new algorithm for sub-pixel shoreline extraction, both at the sub-pixel level. The analysis of the initial errors shows the influence that differences in reflectance of land cover types have over shoreline detection, allowing us to create a model to substantially reduce these errors. Three correction models were defined according to the type of gain used in the acquisition of the original Landsat images. Error assessment tests were applied on three artificially stabilised coastal segments that have a constant and well-defined land-water boundary. A testing set of 45 images (28 TM, 10 ETM high-gain and 7 ETM low-gain) was used. The mean error obtained in shoreline location ranges from 1.22 to 1.63 m, and the RMSE from 4.69 to 5.47 m. Since the errors follow a normal distribution, then the maximum error at a given probability can be estimated. The results confirm that the use of Landsat imagery for detection of instantaneous coastlines yields accuracy comparable to high-resolution techniques, showing the potential of Landsat TM and ETM images in those applications where the instantaneous lines are a good geomorphological descriptor.

AB This study presents a robust approach for characterization of multi-layered forests using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Fuel mapping or biomass estimation requires knowing the diversity and boundaries of the forest patches, as well as their spatial pattern. This includes the thickness of the main vegetation layers, but also the spatial arrangement and size of the individual plants that compose each stratum. In order to decompose the ALS point cloud into genuine 3-D segments corresponding to individual vegetation features, such as shrubs or tree crowns, we apply a statistical approach based on the mean shift algorithm. The segments are progressively assigned to a forest layer: ground vegetation, understory or overstory. Our method relies on a single biophysically meaningful parameter, the kernel bandwidth, which is related to the local forest structure. It is validated on 44 plots of a Portuguese forest, composed mainly of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globulus Labill.) and maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.) trees. The number of detected trees varies with the dominance position: from 98.6% for the dominant trees to 12.8% for the suppressed trees. Linear regression models explain up to 70% of the variability associated with ground vegetation and understory height. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from satellite observations provide important information on the state of terrestrial vegetation over a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. For understanding long-term changes in terrestrial ecosystems (post-1981), data collected by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board the satellites of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) series is a unique source of information. In this paper, we describe a new processing methodology for a comprehensive AVHRR data set at 1 km spatial resolution acquired over Canada, the northern United States and Greenland post-1981. The methodology incorporates a pre-processing algorithm, Canadian AVHRR Processing System (CAPS), recently developed by the Canada Centre of Remote Sensing (CCRS), which enables highly accurate geolocation and ortho-rectification. at efficiency rates of > 90%. Once image navigation is completed, our approach consists of five key steps: first, two clear-sky composites for each 10 day interval are generated from the forward or backward scattering hemisphere; second, AVHRR Channel 1 and 2 reflectances are normalized to the AVHRR/3 on board NOAA-17 to account for differences in the spectral response function among the AVHRR sensors; third, atmospheric correction is performed using the Simplified Method for Atmospheric correction (SMAC) algorithm, using standard meteorological data sets (water vapor, surface level air pressure, ozone); fourth, NDVI is calculated based on atmospherically corrected Channel 1 and 2 reflectances; and finally, the NDVI is adjusted for directional effects based on the Ross-Thick Li-Sparse Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model. The processed NDVI data are compared to an equivalent spatially and temporally overlapping MODIS NDVI data set from 2001 to 2005 for validation. Results at continental scale indicate that time series of MODIS and AVHRR were similar for a wide range of biomes and generalized ecoregions. Analysis stratified by land cover indicated that the correlation was strongest for homogeneous land cover types, such as cropland, when compared to structurally more diverse classes, such as deciduous broadleaf forests. The comparison of the NDVI at the local scale at seven sites of the Fluxnet Canada Research Network resulted in the correlation coefficient r = 0.95. Given confidence in the processing approach, this NDVI data set can be a valuable source of information for climate and vegetation-related studies over Canada and the northern United States.

AB The spatial and temporal characteristics of the new Sentinel missions, primarily designed to provide routine multidisciplinary observations for operational services, are also very suitable for addressing some of the challenges associated with advancing Earth System sciences. The Sentinels are ensuring long-term observational commitment and will operate a range of instruments with different spectral bands and spatial resolutions with global coverage and high revisit times.
   The complexity of Earth System models has been increasing gradually and most simulations of future climate and Earth system evolution are based on coupled models that include aspects of physics, bio/geo-chemistry, anthropogenic impacts and even recently some elements of socioeconomic factors. Sentinels will provide unique observations to describe such coupled atmosphere, oceans, land and cryosphere and the exchanges among them into Earth System models.
   This paper emphasizes the indispensable value of the data provided by the family of Sentinel constellations in the context of the urgent need for improved process understanding of the Earth system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Studying dune dynamics at the dune-field scale requires intensive fieldwork and a relatively huge dataset. However, this is not always possible with the high cost and the limited availability of data. Here, we present a technique based on the analysis of multi-temporal Landsat-TM images for studying the dynamics of different dune morphologies from five dune-field sites around the world. A pair of Landsat-TM images for each site has been used after performing several steps of image pre-processing and enhancement (i.e. image co-registration, radiometric calibration and histogram equalization). RGB-clustering is a commonly used algorithm for data compression and iso-clustering. In this study, we implemented this technique as an unconventional change-detection algorithm with 32 clustering partitions per band. A bi-temporal layerstack of the near-infrared bands was the input for the RGB-clustering process. RGB-clustering produced thematic maps that gave an immediate insight into the dune dynamics at the dune-field scale given the availability of Landsat images. The technique gave the best results with dunes developed under uni-directional wind pattern. In addition, it was also easier to detect migration of simple dunes than in compound or complex dunes. These maps can be used as a bi-temporal digital atlas of large dune-systems and help in defining areas for detailed field measurements on dune dynamics and migration. Moreover, it can be implemented in analyzing aeolian systems where field measurements are practically impossible (i.e. large and extra-terrestrial aeolian systems). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new method called Fmask (Function of mask) for cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsat imagery is provided. Landsat Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and Brightness Temperature (BT) are used as inputs. Fmask first uses rules based on cloud physical properties to separate Potential Cloud Pixels (PCPs) and clear-sky pixels. Next, a normalized temperature probability, spectral variability probability, and brightness probability are combined to produce a probability mask for clouds over land and water separately. Then, the PCPs and the cloud probability mask are used together to derive the potential cloud layer. The darkening effect of the cloud shadows in the Near Infrared (NIR) Band is used to generate a potential shadow layer by applying the flood-fill transformation. Subsequently, 3D cloud objects are determined via segmentation of the potential cloud layer and assumption of a constant temperature lapse rate within each cloud object. The view angle of the satellite sensor and the illuminating angle are used to predict possible cloud shadow locations and select the one that has the maximum similarity with the potential cloud shadow mask. If the scene has snow, a snow mask is also produced. For a globally distributed set of reference data, the average Fmask overall cloud accuracy is as high as 96.4%. The goal is development of a cloud and cloud shadow detection algorithm suitable for routine usage with Landsat images. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Green leaf phenology is known to be sensitive to climate variation. Phenology is also important because it exerts significant control on terrestrial carbon cycling and sequestration. High-quality measurements of green leaf phenology are therefore increasingly important for understanding the effects of climate change on ecosystem function and biosphere-atmosphere interactions. In this paper, we compare "near-surface" and satellite remote sensing-based observations of vegetation phenology at four deciduous forest sites. Specifically, we addressed three questions related to how observations of plant phenology measured by red-green-blue (RGB) cameras mounted on towers above forest canopies are related to measurements of phenology acquired by moderate resolution sensors on satellites. First, how are estimated phenophase transition dates or the observable stages in the life cycle of plants influenced by the choice of vegetation index (VI) measured by remote sensing? Second, are VIs and phenological metrics derived from near-surface and satellite remote sensing comparable, and what is the nature and magnitude of covariation between near-surface and satellite-remote sensing-based estimates of phenology at seasonal and interannual time scales? Third, does near-surface remote sensing data provide a basis for validating satellite-derived land surface phenology products and what are the requirements for achieving this goal? Our study provides substantial support for future efforts linking satellite and near-surface remote sensing. We show significant agreement between phenological time series and metrics derived from these two data sources. However, issues of scale and representation strongly influence the relationship between near surface and satellite remote sensing measures of phenology. In particular, intra- and interannual correlation between time series from each source are dependent on how representative the camera FOV is of the regional landscape. Further, our results show that the specific VI used to monitor phenology exerts substantial influence on satellite VI derived phenological metrics, and by extension, how they compare to VI time series and metrics obtained from near-surface remote sensing. These results improve understanding of how near-surface and satellite remote sensing complement each other. However, more work is required to develop formal protocols for evaluating, calibrating and validating satellite remote sensing phenology products using near surface remote sensing at a regional to continental scale.

AB Net primary production (NPP) is a key variable for monitoring and understanding the impacts of environmental change on ecosystems and for generating realistic global and regional carbon budgets. In this paper we present a regional algorithm (RATE) for automatically monitoring the rate of carbon fixation (as measured by NPP) of tropical forests in South America. The algorithm is based on a modification of the SITE ecosystem model and uses data obtained from the procedures for aggregation and correction of data from the MOD12Q1 and MOD15A2 products and meteorological data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). A correction procedure for the MOD15A2 Leaf area index (LAI) and Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) used by the RATE algorithm produced satisfactory LAI and FAPAR estimates when compared against observed values. The algorithm was successfully validated in eight field sites from two types of tropical forests in South America (Amazon rainforest and the Atlantic forest), producing an average error of only 4.72%. When applied to Amazonia, RATE indicates that NPP showed little variation in the 2005 and 2010 drought years (NPP = 1.28 kg-C m(-2) year(-1)) in comparison to non-drought years (NPP = 1.31 kg-C m(-2) year RATE also provides some limited evidence for small decreasing trends in Amazonia carbon assimilation during the period 2001-2010.

AB The spatial and temporal patterns of the forest background reflectance are critically important for retrieving the biophysical parameters of the forest canopy (overstory) and for ecosystem modeling. In this short communication paper, we retrieve the reflectance and seasonal changes of the forest background at 500 m resolution with the 8-day MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model parameters product. For the first time, the satellite data derived results are directly validated with in situ measured seasonal reflectance trajectories of boreal forest understory layers. Our results illustrate the importance of taking into account the documented quality and limitations of the MODIS BRDF product. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Productive wetland systems at land-water interfaces that provide unique ecosystem services are challenging to study because of water dynamics, complex surface cover and constrained field access. We applied object-based image analysis and supervised classification to four 32-m Beijing-1 microsatellite images to examine broad-scale surface cover composition and its change during November 2007-March 2008 low water season at Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake-wetland system in China (>4000 km(2)). we proposed a novel method for semi-automated selection of training objects in this heterogeneous landscape using extreme values of spectral indices (SIs) estimated from satellite data. Dynamics of the major wetland cover types (Water, Mudflat, Vegetation and Sand) were investigated both as transitions among primary classes based on maximum membership value, and as changes in memberships to all classes even under no change in a primary class. Fuzzy classification accuracy was evaluated as match frequencies between classification outcome and a) the best reference candidate class (MAX function) and b) any acceptable reference class (RIGHT function). MAX-based accuracy was relatively high for Vegetation (>= 90%), Water (>= 82%), Mudflat (>= 76%) and the smallest-area Sand (>= 75%) in all scenes; these scores improved with the RIGHT function to 87-100%. Classification uncertainty assessed as the proportion of fuzzy object area within a class at a given fuzzy threshold value was the highest for all classes in November 2007, and consistently higher for Mudflat than for other classes in all scenes. Vegetation was the dominant class in all scenes, occupying 41.2-49.3% of the study area. Object memberships to Vegetation mostly declined from November 2007 to February 2008 and increased substantially only in February-March 2008, possibly reflecting growing season conditions and grazing. Spatial extent of Water both declined and increased during the study period, reflecting precipitation and hydrological events. The "fuzziest" Mudflat class was involved in major detected transitions among classes and declined in classification accuracy by March 2008, representing a key target for finer-scale research. Future work should introduce Vegetation sub-classes reflecting differences in phenology and alternative methods to discriminate Mudflat from other classes. Results can be used to guide field sampling and top-down landscape analyses in this wetland. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cross-evaluation of sea surface temperature (SST) algorithms was undertaken using split-window channels of Meteosat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) as a proxy for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-R (GOES-R) Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). The goal of the study was to select the algorithm which provides the highest and the most uniform SST accuracy within the area observed by the geostationary sensor. The previously established algorithms, such as Non-Linear Regression (NLR) and Optimal Estimation (OE) were implemented along with two new algorithms, Incremental Regression (IncR) and Corrected Non-Linear Regression (CNLR), developed within preparations for the GOES-R ABI mission. OE. IncR and CNLR adopt the first guesses for SST and brightness temperatures (BT) and retrieve deviations of SST from the first guess (increments). OE retrieves SST increments with inversion of the radiative transfer model, whereas CNLR and IncR use regression equations. The difference between CNLR and IncR is that CNLR uses NLR coefficients, whereas IncR implies optimization of coefficients specifically for incremental formulation. Accuracy and precision of SST retrievals were evaluated by comparison with drifting buoys. The major observations from this study are as follows: 1) all algorithms adopting first guesses for SST and BTs are capable of improving SST accuracy and precision over NLR; and 2) IncR delivers the highest overall SST precision and the most uniform distributions of regional SST accuracy and precision. This paper also addresses implementation and validation issues such as bias correction in simulated BTs; preserving sensitivity of incremental SST retrievals to true SST variations; and selection of criteria for optimization and validation of incremental algorithms.

AB The circumpolar taiga-tundra ecotone was delineated using an image-segmentation-based mapping approach with multi-annual MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover data. Circumpolar tree canopy cover (TCC) throughout the ecotone was derived by averaging MODIS VCF data from 2000 to 2005 and adjusting the averaged values using linear equations relating MODIS TCC to Quickbird-derived tree cover estimates. The adjustment helped mitigate VCFs overestimation of tree cover in lightly forested regions. An image segmentation procedure was used to group pixels representing similar tree cover into polygonal features (segmentation objects) that form the map of the transition zone. Each polygon represents an area much larger than the 500 m MODIS pixel and characterizes the patterns of sparse forest patches on a regional scale. Those polygons near the boreal/tundra interface with either (1) mean adjusted TCC values from 5 to 20%, or (2) mean adjusted TCC values <5% but with a standard deviation >5% were used to identify the ecotone. Comparisons of the adjusted average tree cover data were made with (1) two existing tree line definitions aggregated for each 1 longitudinal interval in North America and Eurasia, (2) Landsat-derived Canadian proportion of forest cover for Canada, and (3) with canopy cover estimates extracted from airborne profiling lidar data that transected 1238 of the TCC polygons. The adjusted TCC from MODIS VCF shows, on average, <12% TCC for all but one regional zone at the intersection with independently delineated tree lines. Adjusted values track closely with Canadian proportion of forest cover data in areas of low tree cover. A comparison of the 1238 TCC polygons with profiling lidar measurements yielded an overall accuracy of 67.7%. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The floodplain forests bordering the Amazon River have outstanding ecological, economic, and social importance for the region. However, the original distribution of these forests is not well known, since they have suffered severe degradation since the 16th century. The previously published vegetation map of the Amazon River floodplain (Hess et al., 2003), based on data acquired in 1996, shows enormous difference in vegetation cover classes between the regions upstream and downstream of the city of Manaus. The upper floodplain is mostly covered by forests, while the lower floodplain is predominantly occupied by grasses and shrubs.
   This study assesses deforestation in the Lower Amazon floodplain over a similar to 30 year period by producing and comparing a historical vegetation map based on MSS/Landsat images acquired in the late 1970s with a recent vegetation map produced from TM/Landsat images obtained in 2008. The maps were generated through the following steps: 1) normalization and mosaicking of images for each decade; 2) application of a linear mixing model transformation to produce vegetation, soil and shade fraction-images; and 3) object-oriented image analysis and classification. For both maps, the following classes were mapped: floodplain forest, non-forest floodplain vegetation, bare soil and open water. The two maps were combined using object-level Boolean operations to identify time transitions among the mapped classes, resulting in a map of the land cover change occurred over similar to 30 years. Ground information collected at 168 ground points was used to build confusion matrices and calculate Kappa indices of agreement. A survey strategy combining field observations and interviews allowed the collection of information about both recent and historical land cover for validation purposes. Kappa values (0.77, 0.75 and 0.75) indicated the good quality of the maps, and the error estimates were used to adjust the estimated deforested area to a value of 3457 km(2) +/- 1062 km(2) (95% CI) of floodplain deforestation over the similar to 30 years.

AB Wildland fires are an annually recurring phenomenon in many terrestrial ecosystems. Accurate burned area estimates are important for modeling fire-induced trace gas emissions and rehabilitating post-fire landscapes. High spatial and spectral resolution MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator data acquired over three 2007 southern California burns were used to evaluate the sensitivity of different spectral indices at discriminating burned land shortly after a fire. The performance of the indices, which included both traditional and new band combinations, was assessed by means of a separability index that provides an assessment of the effectiveness of a given index at discriminating between burned and unburned land. In the context of burned land applications results demonstrated (i) that the highest sensitivity of the longer short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral region (1.9 to 2.5 mu m) was found at the band interval from 2.31 to 2.36 mu m, (ii) the high discriminatory power of the mid infrared spectral domain (3 to 5.5 mu m) and (iii) the high potential of emissivity data. As a consequence, a newly proposed index which combined near infrared (NIR), longer SWIR and emissivity outperformed all other indices when results were averaged over the three fires. Results were slightly different between land cover types (shrubland vs. forest-woodland). Prior to use in the indices the thermal infrared data were separated into temperature and emissivity to assess the benefits of using both temperature and emissivity. Currently, the only spaceborne sensor that provides moderate spatial resolution (<100 m) temperature and emissivity data is the Advanced Spaceborne and Thermal Emission Radiometer (ASTER). Therefore, our findings can open new perspectives for the utility of future sensors, such as the Hyperspectral Infrared (HyspIRI) sensor. However, further research is required to evaluate the performance of the newly proposed band combinations in other vegetation types and different fire regimes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Empirical relationships between the sea surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)), sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), and sea surface temperature (SST), were derived from shipboard pCO(2) measurements in sea water and atmosphere, in-situ Chl-a, and SST data along cruise tracks between Zhongshan Station in East Antarctica and Changcheng Station on the Antarctic Peninsula in December 1999, January 2000, December 2004 and January 2005 during the CHINARE XVI and XXI campaigns. These relationships were then applied to datasets of remotely sensed Chl-a and SST to estimate the monthly air-sea carbon flux and the uptake of atmospheric CO2 in the southern Atlantic and Indian Ocean. The results show significant spatial and temporal variability of carbon flux in the southern Atlantic and Indian Ocean. The monthly uptakes of atmospheric CO2 in the region from 50 degrees S to the ice edge between 60 degrees W and 80 degrees E are -0.00355 GtC, -0.00573 GtC in December 1999 and January 2000, and -0.00361 GtC, -0.00525 GtC in December 2004 and January 2005, respectively.

AB Understory fires in Amazon forests alter forest structure, species composition, and the likelihood of future disturbance. The annual extent of fire-damaged forest in Amazonia remains uncertain due to difficulties in separating burning from other types of forest damage in satellite data. We developed a new approach, the Burn Damage and Recovery (BDR) algorithm, to identify fire-related canopy damages using spatial and spectral information from multi-year time series of satellite data. The BDR approach identifies understory fires in intact and logged Amazon forests based on the reduction and recovery of live canopy cover in the years following fire damages and the size and shape of individual understory burn scars. The BDR algorithm was applied to time series of Landsat (1997-2004) and MODIS (2000-2005) data covering one Landsat scene (path/row 226/068) in southern Amazonia and the results were compared to field observations, image-derived burn scars, and independent data on selective logging and deforestation. Landsat resolution was essential for detection of burn scars < 50 ha, yet these small burns contributed only 12% of all burned forest detected during 1997-2002. MODIS data were suitable for mapping medium (50-500 ha) and large (> 500 ha) burn scars that accounted for the majority of all fire-damaged forests in this study. Therefore, moderate resolution satellite data may be suitable to provide estimates of the extent of fire-damaged Amazon forest at a regional scale. In the study region, Undsat-based understory fire damages in 1999 (1508 km(2)) were an order of magnitude higher than during the 1997-1998 El Nino event (124 km(2) and 39 km(2), respectively), suggesting a different link between climate and understory fires than previously reported for other Amazon regions. The results in this study illustrate the potential to address critical questions concerning climate and fire risk in Amazon forests by applying the BDR algorithm over larger areas and longer image time series.

AB Daily evapo-transpiration (ET) was mapped at the regional extent over a Mediterranean vineyard watershed, by using ASTER imagery along with two temperature differencing methods: the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI) and the Water Deficit Index (WDI). Validation of remotely sensed estimates was conducted during almost two growth cycles (August 2007-October 2008) over seven sites that differed in soil properties, water status and canopy structure. S-SEBI and WDI were also intercompared at the watershed extent by considering ASTER imagery collected between 2002 and 2008. In order to alleviate the experimental efforts devoted to the validation exercise, ground truthing relied on in situ estimates from the HYDRUS-1D model that simulates water transfers within the vadose zone after calibration against measured soil moisture profiles. For two of the seven validation sites, the consistency of the HYDRUS-1D simulations was beforehand controlled against direct measurements with eddy covariance devices. Thus, it was shown the HYDRUS-1D simulations could be used as ground truthing.
   Despite the use of simple differencing methods over a complex row-structured landscape, the obtained accuracies (0.8 mm.d(-1) for S-SEBI and 1.1 mm.d(-1) for WDI) were similar to those reported in the literature for simpler canopies, and fulfilled requirements for further applications in agronomy and hydrology. WDI performed worse than S-SEBI, in spite of more determinism within the derivation of evaporative extremes used for temperature differencing. This raised the question of compromising between process description and measurement availability. Analyzing validation results suggested that among the possible factors that could affect model performance (spatial variability, soil type and color, row orientation), the first-order influence was row orientation, a property that can be characterized from very high spatial resolution remote sensing data. Finally, intercomparing S-SEBI and WDI at the watershed extent showed estimates from both models agreed within 1 mm.d(-1), a difference similar to the model accuracies as estimated by the validation exercise. Then, time averaged maps suggested the existence of spatial patterns at the watershed extent, which may be ascribed to combined effects from soil type, soil depth and watertable level.

AB The gravimetric water content (GWC, %), a commonly used measure of leaf water content, describes the ratio of water to dry matter for each individual leaf. To date, the relationship between spectral reflectance and GWC in leaves is poorly understood due to the confounding effects of unpredictably varying water and dry matter ratios on spectral response. Few studies have attempted to estimate GWC from leaf reflectance spectra, particularly for a variety of species. This paper investigates the spectroscopic estimation of leaf GWC using continuous wavelet analysis applied to the reflectance spectra (350-2500 nm) of 265 leaf samples from 47 species observed in tropical forests of Panama. A continuous wavelet transform was performed on each of the reflectance spectra to generate a wavelet power scalogram compiled as a function of wavelength and scale. Linear relationships were built between wavelet power and GWC expressed as a function of dry mass (LWCD) and fresh mass (LWCF) in order to identify wavelet features (coefficients) that are most sensitive to changes in GWC. The derived wavelet features were then compared to three established spectral indices used to estimate GWC across a wide range of species.
   Eight wavelet features observed between 1300 and 2500 nm provided strong correlations with LWCD, though correlations between spectral indices and leaf GWC were poor. In particular, two features captured amplitude variations in the broad shape of the reflectance spectra and three features captured variations in the shape and depth of dry matter (e.g., protein, lignin, cellulose) absorptions centered near 1730 and 2100 nm. The eight wavelet features used to predict LWCD and LWCF were not significantly different; however, predictive models used to determine LWCD and LWCF differed. The most accurate estimates of LWCD and LWCF obtained from a single wavelet feature showed root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 28.34% (R-2 = 0.62) and 4.86% (R-2 = 0.69), respectively. Models using a combination of features resulted in a noticeable improvement predicting LWCD and LWCF with RMSEs of 26.04% (R-2 = 0.71) and 4.34% (R-2 = 0.75), respectively. These results provide new insights into the role of dry matter absorption features in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral region for the accurate spectral estimation of LWCD and LWCF. This emerging spectral analytical approach can be applied to other complex datasets including a broad range of species, and may be adapted to estimate basic leaf biochemical elements such as nitrogen, chlorophyll, cellulose, and lignin.

AB Accurate assessment of phytoplankton chlorophyll a (Chla) concentration in turbid waters by means of remote sensing is challenging due to optically complexity and significant variability of case 2 waters, especially in inland waters with multiple optical types. In this study, a water optical classification algorithm is developed, and two semi-analytical algorithms (three- and four-band algorithm) for estimating Chla are calibrated and validated using four independent datasets collected from Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake, and Three Gorges Reservoir. The optical classification algorithm is developed using the dataset collected in Taihu Lake from 2006 to 2009. This dataset is also used to calibrate the three- and four-band Chla estimation algorithms. The optical classification technique uses remote sensing reflectance at three bands: Rrs(G), Rrs(650), and Rrs (NIR), where G indicates the location of reflectance peak in the green region (around 560 nm), and NIR is the location of reflectance peak in the near-infrared region (around 700 nm). Optimal reference wavelengths of the three- and four-band algorithm are located through model tuning and accuracy optimization. The three- and four-band algorithm accuracy is further evaluated using other three independent datasets. The improvement of optical classification in Chla estimation is revealed by comparing the performance of the two algorithms for non-classified and classified waters.
   Using the slopes of the three reflectance bands, the 138 reflectance spectra samples in the calibration dataset are classified into three classes, each with a specific spectral shape character. The three- and four-band algorithm performs well for both non-classified and classified waters in estimating Chla. For non-classified waters, strong relationships are yielded between measured and predicted Chla, but the performance of the two algorithms is not satisfactory in low Chla conditions, especially for samples with Chla below 30 mg m(-3). For classified waters, the class-specific algorithms perform better than for non-classified waters. Class-specific algorithms reduce considerable mean relative error from algorithms for non-classified waters in Chla predicting. Optical classification makes that there is no need to adjust the optimal position to estimate Chla for other waters using the class-specific algorithms. The findings in this study demonstrate that optical classification can greatly improve the accuracy of Chla estimation in optically complex waters. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) has collected over 250 million measurements of vegetation height over forests globally. Accurate vegetation heights can be determined using waveform metrics that include vertical extent and extent of the waveform's trailing and leading edges. All three indices are highly dependent upon the signal strength, background noise and signal-to-noise ratio of the waveform, as the background noise contribution to the waveforms has to be removed before their calculation. Over the last six years, GLAS has collected data during thirteen observation periods using illumination from three different lasers. The power levels of these lasers have changed over time, resulting in variable signal power and noise characteristics. Atmospheric conditions vary continuously, also influencing signal power and noise.
   To minimize these effects, we optimized a noise coefficient which could be constant or vary according to observation period or noise metric. This parameter is used with the mean and standard deviation of the background noise to determine a noise level threshold that is removed from each waveform. An optimization analysis was used with a global dataset of waveforms that are near-coincident with waveforms from other observation periods; the goal of the optimization was to minimize the difference in vertical extent between spatially overlapping GLAS observations. Optimizations based on absolute difference in height led to situations in which the total extent was minimized as well; further optimizations reduced a normalized difference in height extent. The simplest optimizations were based on a constant value to be applied to all observations; noise coefficients of 2.7, 3.2, 3.4 and 4.0 were determined for datasets consisting of global forests, global vegetation, forest in the legal Amazon basin and boreal forests respectively. Optimizations based on the power level or the signal-to-noise ratio of waveforms best minimized differences in waveform extent, decreasing the percent root mean squared height difference by 25-54% over the constant value approach. Further development of methods to ensure temporal consistency of waveform indices will be necessary to support long-term satellite lidar missions and will result in more accurate and precise estimates of canopy height.

AB ASTER reflectance spectra from Cuprite, Nevada, and Mountain Pass, California, were compared to spectra of field samples and to ASTER-resampled AVIRIS reflectance data to determine spectral accuracy and spectroscopic mapping potential of two new ASTER SWIR reflectance datasets: RefL1b and AST_07XT. RefL1b is a new reflectance dataset produced for this study using ASTER Level 1B data, crosstalk correction, radiance correction factors, and concurrently acquired level 2 MODIS water vapor data The AST_07XT data product, available from EDC and ERSDAC. incorporates crosstalk correction and non-concurrently acquired MODIS water vapor data for atmospheric correction. Spectral accuracy was determined using difference values which were compiled from ASTER band 5/6 and 9/8 ratios of AST_07XT or RefL1b data subtracted from similar ratios calculated for field sample and AVIRIS reflectance data. In addition, Spectral Analyst, a statistical program that utilizes a Spectral Feature Fitting algorithm, was used to quantitatively assess spectral accuracy of AST_07XT and RefL1b data.
   Spectral Analyst matched more minerals correctly and had higher scores for the RefL1b data than for AST_07XT data. The radiance correction factors used in the RefL1b data corrected a low band 5 reflectance anomaly observed in the AST_07XT and AST_07 data but also produced anomalously high band 5 reflectance in RefL1b spectra with strong band 5 absorption for minerals, such as alunite Thus, the band 5 anomaly seen in the RefL1b data cannot be corrected using additional gain adjustments. In addition, the use of concurrent MODIS water vapor data in the atmospheric correction of the RefL1b data produced datasets that had lower band 9 reflectance anomalies than the AST_07XT data Although assessment of spectral data suggests that RefL1b data are more consistent and spectrally more correct than AST_07XT data, the Spectral Analyst results indicate that spectral discrimination between some minerals, such as alunite and kaolinite, are still not possible unless additional spectral calibration using site specific spectral data are performed.

AB The present study investigated the use of physiological indices calculated from hyperspectral remote sensing imagery as potential indicators of wine grape quality assessment in vineyards affected by iron deficiency chlorosis. Different cv. Tempranillo/110 Richter vineyards located in northern Spain. affected and non-affected by iron chlorosis, were identified for field and airborne data collection. Airborne campaigns imaged a total of 14 study areas in both 2004 and 2005 using the AHS hyperspectral sensor, which acquired 20 spectral bands in the VIS-NIR region Field measurements were conducted in each study site to obtain leaf and grape physiological parameters potentially linked to wine quality Simulations carried out with the rowMCRM radiative transfer model demonstrated the feasibility of estimating leaf chlorophyll a + b (C-ab) content using TCARI/OSAVI from AHS spectral bands In addition to traditional structural vegetation indices (NDVI) and successful canopy-level chlorophyll indices (TCARI/OSAVI), other innovative physiological indices sensitive to changes in carotenoid (Car) and anthocyanin (Anth) content in leaves were assessed from the imagery. The rowMCRM model simulations were used to evaluate canopy structural effects on these physiological indices as a function of the typical row-structured canopy variables in vineyards (LAI, crown width, row distances, C-ab content and soil background effects). Modeling results concluded that Car (Gitelson-Car2) and Anth (Gitelson-Anth) indices were highly affected by canopy structure (C-w, V-s) and soil background (rho(s)). Field measurements of grape composition and quality were used to assess potential relationships with physiological indices sensitive to foliar pigment content (C-ab, Car and Anal) NDVI and TCARI/OSAVI indices yielded lower relationships for CIRG and IMAD must quality parameters than Car and Anth physiological indices These results suggest that the increase in carotenes and anthocyanins due to drought, thermal damage or micronutrient deficiencies is a better indicator to detect phenolic ripening difficulties for vines affected by iron chlorosis than chlorosis detection Therefore, the potential use of physiological remote sensing indices related to carotene and anthocyanin pigments demonstrates their importance as grape quality indicators in vineyards affected by iron chlorosis (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved

AB A unique glacial spring system exists at Borup Fiord pass, in the Canadian High Arctic, emerging from a glacial surface and depositing elemental sulfur, gypsum and calcite across a portion of the glacier. The presence of sulfur springs associated with glacial ice is extremely rare in a terrestrial context, and the resulting deposits may provide a field analog to non-ice materials on the surface of Europa. Spectral characterization of the supraglacial deposits in the visible-near infrared (VIS-NIR) range, 0.4-2.5 mu m, was carried out using reflectance spectra collected in situ using a field spectrometer during the 2006 field season. These spectra, while dominated by melting snow, ice, and sulfur, show that some absorption features of the sulfates are shifted in wavelength with respect to library spectra due to the effects of mixing or temperature. Absorption features of calcite are largely absent, potentially due to mineral partitioning effects within the deposits. Investigations into changes in mineralogy within the deposits over the course of the active season using data collected by the Hyperion hyperspectral visible/infrared spectrometer aboard the Earth Observing 1 spacecraft (EO-1) were limited by low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios in the data, although they indicate that sulfur is remaining stable. This is confirmed by seasonal data on the extent of the deposits, obtained using a classification algorithm running onboard the satellite, which continued to detect the presence of sulfur until snow obscured the site. Ground truth for the observations is provided by mineralogical analyses obtained by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements and laboratory reflectance spectra from 0.2-25 mu m obtained of samples returned from the site in 2006. We show that while sulfur, the main constituent of the deposits, is well represented in Hyperion data, minor constituents such as calcite and gypsum can be partially or entirely masked in the data. In spite of these effects, autonomous detection methods can be utilized to monitor the generation and extent of the deposits, whose spectral properties show similarities with those of Europa's non-ice materials.

AB Formerly, tree height has been more difficult to measure accurately in the field than tree diameter at breast height. As a consequence, models to predict height from diameter measurements have been widely developed in the forestry literature. Through the use of airborne laser scanning technology (e.g., LiDAR), tree variables such as height and crown diameter can be measured accurately, a development which has spawned the need for models to predict diameter from airborne laser-derived measurements. Although some work has been done for fitting such models, none have incorporated spatial information to improve the accuracy of the predicted diameters. Using a simple linear model for predicting tree diameter from laser-derived tree height and crown diameter measurements, we compared the performance of ordinary least squares (OLS), generalized least squares with a non-null correlation structure (GLS), linear mixed-effects model (LME), and geographically weighted regression (GWR). Our data were obtained from 36 sample plots established in Norway. This is the first study to examine the use of spatial statistical models for tree-level LiDAR data. Root mean square prediction errors in tree diameter with LME are 3.5%, with GWR are 10%, and with OLS and GLS are 17%. LME also exhibited low variability in predicting performance across all the validation classes (based on laser-derived height). Giving the difficulties of using parametric statistical inference (such as maximum likelihood-based indices) for GWR, we used permutation tests as a way for detecting statistical differences. LME was significantly better than the other models, as well as GWR was to OLS and GLS. Our results indicate that the LME model produced the best predictions of tree diameter from LiDAR-based variables to a degree that has previously not been possible. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB In situ measurements of snow albedo at five stations along a north-south transect in the dry-snow facies of the interior of Greenland follow the theoretically expected dependence of snow albedo with solar zenith angle (SZA). Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net) measurements from 1997 through 2007 exhibit the trend of modest surface brightening with increasing SZA on both diurnal and seasonal timescales. SZA explains up to 50% of seasonal albedo variability. The two other environmental factors considered, temperature and cloudiness, play much less significant roles in seasonal albedo variability at the five stations studied. Compared to the 10-year record of these GC-Net measurements, the five-year record of MODIS satellite-retrieved snow albedo shows a systematic negative bias for SZA larger than about 55 degrees. Larger bias of MODIS snow albedo exists at more northerly stations. MODIS albedos successfully capture the snow albedo dependence on SZA and have a relatively good agreement with GC-Net measurements for SZA<55 degrees. The discrepancy of MODIS albedo with in situ albedo and with theory is determined mainly by two related factors. SZA and retrieval quality. While the spatioternporal structure, especially zonal features, of the MODIS-retrieved albedo may be correct for large SZA, the accuracy deteriorates for SZA>55 degrees and often becomes physically unrealistic for SZA > 65 degrees. This unphysical behavior biases parameterizations of surface albedo and restricts the range of usefulness of the MODIS albedo products. Seasonal-to-interannual trends in surface brightness in Greenland, and in polar (i.e., large SZA) regions in general, and model simulations of these trends, should be evaluated in light of these limitations.

AB Consistent, spatially and temporally complete reflectance time series are required for reliable terrestrial monitoring. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), like other polar-orbiting wide field of view satellite sensors, can provide global observations on a nearly daily basis, but the sparseness of valid observations due to cloud, residual atmospheric effects, and sensor anomalies, may result in gaps in the derived reflectance time series. This paper presents an approach for the generation of temporally complete daily MODIS 500 m nadir view BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) time series. The research is illustrated and assessed quantitatively using two years of cloud and snow screened, daily MODIS Terra and Aqua reflectance data at four sites in Africa, and demonstrated for phenology monitoring using NBAR derived NDVI time series. The components of the approach include: 1) an outlier detection algorithm to remove residual anomalous daily observations undetected in the upstream processing, 2) the dynamic generation of NBAR time series on a daily basis when seven or more observations are available for a day under consideration over a 16-day period, and 3) the means to gap fill the NBAR time series where less than 7 observations are available. The MODIS Ross-Thick/Li-Sparse-Reciprocal BRDF model is used with a rolling approach whereby a 16-day BRDF inversion window is moved on a daily overlapping basis to provide more reliable outlier detection and daily NBAR. NBAR gap filling in periods of missing observations is investigated using static land cover specific archetype BRDF parameters and using BRDF parameters defined adaptively from the temporally closest 16-day periods with 7 or more observations. Scaling factor estimators using ordinary least squares (OLS) and median-based robust least squares regression are investigated, and the robust method is demonstrated to provide on average temporally more coherent gap filled NBAR values. For regions with persistent clouds, the utility of the adaptive NBAR gap filling method is demonstrated to be severely limited due to the decreased likelihood that the surface BRDF at each gap can be described reliably. The reliability of the NBAR gap filling methodology is evaluated statistically using a cross-validation approach. For the small number of study site considered, the adaptive method is shown to provide more accurate results than the archetype method when there are more than an average of similar to 4-5 observations per 16-day window, or when a gap day is on average less than about 30 days from a 16-day period with 7 or more observations. The resulting gap free daily NBAR time series and derived daily NBAR NDVI generated by the approach is shown to capture phenological variations in a coherent temporally consistent manner, suggesting that it is a fruitful avenue for future research and validation.

AB This paper reports the development of a decision tree algorithm to classify the surface soil freeze/thaw states. The algorithm uses SSM/I brightness temperatures recorded in the early morning. Three critical indices are used as classification criteria-the scattering index (SI), the 37 GHz vertical polarization brightness temperature (T-37v), and the 19 GHz polarization difference (PD19). The thresholds of these criteria were obtained from samples of frozen soil, thawed soil, desert, and snow. The algorithm is capable of distinguishing between frozen soil, thawed soil, desert and precipitation. In-situ 4-cm deep soil temperatures on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau were used to validate the classification results, and the average classification accuracy was found to be 87% Regarding the misclassified pixels, about 40% and 73% of them appeared when the surface soil temperature ranged from -0.5 degrees C to 0.5 degrees C and from -2.0 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C, respectively, which means that most misclassifications occurred near the soil freezing point In addition, misclassifications mainly occurred from April to May and September to October, the transition periods between warm and cold seasons. A grid-to-grid Kappa analysis was also conducted to evaluate the consistency between the map of the actual number of frozen days obtained using the decision tree classification algorithm and the reference map of geocryological regionalization and classification in China. The overall classification accuracy was 91.7%, and the Kappa index was 80.5%. The boundary between the frozen and thawed soil was consistent with the southern limit of seasonally frozen ground from the reference map. The statistics show that the maximum area of frozen soil is about 6.82 x 10(6) km(2) in late January, accounting for 69% of total Chinese land area. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A simple method for efficient inversion of arbitrary radiative transfer models for image analysis is presented. The method operates by representing the shape of the function that maps model parameters to spectral reflectance by an adaptive look-up tree (ALUT) that evenly distributes the discretization error of tabulated reflectances in spectral space. A post-processing step organizes the data into a binary space partitioning tree that facilitates an efficient inversion search algorithm. In an example shallow water remote sensing application, the method performs faster than an implementation of previously published methodology and has the same accuracy in bathymetric retrievals. The method has no user configuration parameters requiring expert knowledge and minimizes the number of forward model runs required, making it highly suitable for routine operational implementation of image analysis methods. For the research community, straightforward and robust inversion allows research to focus on improving the radiative transfer models themselves without the added complication of devising an inversion strategy.

AB Vegetation indices derived from remote sensing data provide information about the variability in stature, growth and vigor of the vegetation across a region. and have been used to model plant processes. For example, the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) provides a measure of greenness of the vegetation that can be used to predict net primary production. However, ecosystem models relying on remote sensing data for EVI or other vegetation indices are limited by the time series of the satellite data record. Our objective was to develop a statistical model to predict EVI in order to extend the time series for modeling applications. To explain the functional behavior of the seasonal EVI curves, a two-stage multiple regression fitting procedure within a semi-parametric mixed effect (SPME) model framework was used. First, a linear mixed effect (LME) model was fitted to the EVI with climate indexes, crop and irrigation information as predictor variables. Second, Penalized B-splines were used to explain the behavior of the smooth residuals, which result from a smooth model fit to the smooth EVI data curve, in order to describe the uncertainty of the EVI curve. Individual models were fit within individual Major Land Resources Areas (MLRAs). Predicted seasonal EVI, derived from our regression equations, showed a strong agreement with the observed EVI and was able to capture the site by site and year by year variation in the EVI curve. Out-of-sample prediction produced excellent results for a majority of the sites, except for sites without clear seasonal patterns, which may have resulted from cloud contamination and/or snow cover. Therefore, given the appropriate climate, crop, and irrigation information, the proposed approach can be used to predict seasonal EVI curves for extending the time series into the past and future.

AB AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) GIMMS (Global Inventory Modelling and Mapping Studies) NDVI (Normalized Difference vegetation Index) data is available from 1981 to present time. The global coverage 8 km resolution 15-day composite data set has been used for numerous local to global scale vegetation time series studies during recent years. Several aspects however potentially introduce noise in the NDVI data set due to the AVHRR sensor design and data processing. More recent NDVI data sets from both Terra MODIS and SPOT VGT data are considered an improvement over AVHRR and these products in theory provide a possibility to evaluate the accuracy of GIMMS NDVI time series trend analysis for the overlapping period of available data. In this study the accuracy of the GIMMS NDVI time series trend analysis is evaluated by comparison with the 1 km resolution Terra MODIS (MOD13A2) 16-day composite NDVI data, the SPOT Vegetation (VGT) 10-day composite (S10) NDVI data and in situ measurements of a test site in Dahra, Senegal. Linear least squares regression trend analysis on eight years of GIMMS annual average NDVI (20002007) has been compared to Terra MODIS (1 km and 8 km resampled) and SPOT VGT NDVI data 1 km (20002007). The three data products do not exhibit identical patterns of NDVI trends. SPOT VGT NDVI data are characterised by higher positive regression slopes over the 8-year period as compared to Terra MODIS and AVHRR GIMMS NDVI data, possibly caused by a change in channels 1 and 2 spectral response functions from SPOT VGT1 to SPOT VGT2 in 2003. Trend analysis of AVHRR GIMMS NDVI exhibits a regression slope range in better agreement with Terra MODIS NDVI for semi-arid areas. However, GIMMS NDVI shows a tendency towards higher positive regression slope values than Terra MODIS in more humid areas. Validation of the different NDVI data products against continuous in situ NDVI measurements for the period 2002-2007 in the semi-arid Senegal revealed a good agreement between in situ measurements and all satellite based NDVI products. Using Terra MODIS NDVI as a reference, it is concluded that AVHRR GIMMS coarse resolution NDVI data set is well-suited for long term vegetation studies of the Sahel-Sudanian areas receiving < 1000 mm rainfall, whereas interpretation of GIMMS NDVI trends in more humid areas of the Sudanian-Guinean zones should be done with certain reservations.

AB A new Bitemporal Mineral Dust Index (BMDI) is derived from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) infrared observations over land at two different time slots per day.
   This daily dust index is evaluated with AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) surface observations. MODerate resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) "Deep Blue" Aerosol Optical Depth (ADD) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Aerosol Index, showing a good capability of the BMDI for dust detection and dust load estimation over land and also over deserts. BMDI dust detection is shown to be limited in scenes with high atmospheric humidity as e.g. coastal regions. In particular the insensitivity of BMDI to biomass burning aerosol is shown, leading to the possibility of remote sensing of mineral dust also in regions with large contributions of biomass burning aerosol to the total column aerosol concentrations. Time series of mineral dust as inferred from BMDI for the year 2006 are presented for four regions over the Sahara. These time series show strong (and different) annual cycles of dust load for all four regions. Especially the strong episodic character of atmospheric dust in the main source regions can be inferred from BMDI observations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The comparison of classification accuracy statements has generally been based upon tests of difference or inequality when other scenarios and approaches may be more appropriate. Procedures for evaluating two scenarios with interest focused on the similarity in accuracy values, non-inferiority and equivalence, are outlined following a discussion of tests of difference (inequality). It is also suggested that the confidence interval of the difference in classification accuracy may be used as well as or instead of conventional hypothesis testing to reveal more information about the disparity in the classification accuracy values compared.

AB The national forests (NFs) in the United States are protected areas managed for multiple purposes, and therefore are subject to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Monitoring forest changes arising from such disturbances and the post-disturbance recovery processes is essential for assessing the conditions of the NFs and the effectiveness of management approaches. In this study, we used time series stacks of Landsat images (LTSS) to evaluate the dynamics of seven NFs in eastern United States, including the De Soto NF the Talladega NF the Francis Marion NF and the Uwharrie NF in southeastern U.S., and the Chequamegon NF, the Hiawatha NF, and the Superior NF in northern U.S. Each LTSS consisted of 12-14 Landsat images acquired for the same location, spanning from 1984 to 2006 with a nominal interval of one image every 2 years. Each LTSS was analyzed using a vegetation change tracker (VCT) algorithm to map forest disturbance. Accuracy assessments of the derived disturbance maps revealed that they had overall accuracy values of about 80%, with most of the disturbance classes having user's accuracies ranging from 70% to 95%. The producer's accuracies were generally lower, with the majority being in the range between 50% and 70%. While this may suggest that the disturbance maps could slightly underestimate disturbances, a more detailed assessment of the omission errors revealed that the majority of the disagreements were due to minor disturbances like thinning or storm damages that were identified by the image analysts but were not captured by the VCT algorithm.
   The derived disturbance year maps revealed that while each of the seven NFs consisted of 90% or more forest land, significant portions of the forests were disturbed since 1984. Mapped disturbances accounted for about 30%-45% of total land area in the four NFs in southeastern U.S. and about 10%-20% in the three NFs in northern U.S. The disturbance rates were generally higher in the buffer zones surrounding each NF, and varied considerably over time. The time series approach employed in this study represents a new approach for monitoring forest resources using the Landsat or similar satellite data records. The disturbance products derived using this approach were spatially explicit and contained much more temporal details than conventional bi-temporal change products, and likely will be found more useful by many users including ecologists and resources managers. The high disturbance rates found in the southeastern U.S. suggest that this region may have a more significant role in modulating the atmospheric carbon budget than currently recognized.

AB Spectral reflectances of the ocean, R, as derived from ocean color remote sensing data at four wavelengths (412, 443. 490, and 555 nm), can be used to form two ratios of spectral reflectance, namely R(412)/R(443), and R(490)/R(555), thereafter denoted R-443(412) and R-555(490). The former is mainly sensitive to the colored dissolved organic material (CDOM), albeit influenced by the a [gal content as depicted by the chlorophyll concentration, ([Chl]); in contrast, the latter is essentially depending on [Chl], although it is also influenced by CDOM. Therefore the signatures of CDOM and [Chl] which are not truly separable. can nevertheless be identified by considering simultaneously the two ratios. The concomitant variations in these ratios can be established via a bio-optical model developed for Case I waters. This model implicitly includes a "mean" relationship between CDOM and [Chl], and thus produces a unique curve relating R-443(412) and R-555(490). Deviations with respect to this mean relationship can be introduced through a factor (phi), with (phi)>1 (excess) or <1 (deficit), applied to the CDOM[Chl] ratio. A family of R-443(412) and R-555(490) curves is thus generated, in correspondence with the discrete values given to (phi); this "grid" (or numerically, a 2-D lookup table) allows the phi-[Chl] couple to be unambiguously derived for any R-443(412) and R-555(490) couple. By applying this straightforward algorithm to actual reflectance ratios derived from ocean color imagery, the relative anomalies in CDOM with respect to its standard (Chl-related) values can be efficiently assessed. Within the global ocean (discarding the coastal zones), the phi factor is widely varying, between at least and 3, and is roughly log-normally distributed around similar to 1 (no anomaly). The spatial distributions of the phi factor in the whole ocean are Strongly featured according to latitude, season, and hydrographic regimes, and these features are regularly reproducible, from year to year (2002-2007). This simple method is also validated against available in situ data, and its results compare favorably, for instance, to those of the GSM (Garver-Siegel-Maritorena) inversion method, in terms of retrieved CDOM concentrations and distribution patterns.

AB This paper aimed at estimating albedo and Leaf Area Index (LAI) from FORMOSAT-2 satellite that offers a unique source of high spatial resolution (eight meters) images with a high revisit frequency (one to three days). It mainly consisted of assessing the FORMOSAT-2 spectral and directional configurations that are unusual, with a single off nadir viewing angle over four visible-near infra red wavebands. Images were collected over an agricultural region located in South Eastern France, with a three day frequency from the growing season to post-harvest. Simultaneously, numerous ground based measurements were performed over various crops such as wheat, meadow, rice and maize. Albedo and LAI were estimated using empirical approaches that have been widely used for usual directional and spectral configurations (i.e. multidirectional or single nadir viewing angle over visible-near infrared wavebands). Two methods devoted to albedo estimation were assessed. based on stepwise multiple regression and neural network (NNT). Although both methods gave satisfactory results, the NNT performed better (relative RMSE=3.5% versus 7.3%), especially for low vegetation covers over dark or wet soils that corresponded to albedo values lower than 0.20. Four approaches for LAI estimation were assessed. The first approach based on a stepwise multiple regression over reflectances had the worst performance (relative RMSE=65%), when compared to the equally performing NDVI based heuristic relationship and reflectance based NNT approach (relative RMSE=34%).The NDVI based neural network approach had the best performance (relative RMSE=27.5%), due to the combination of NDVI efficient normalization properties and NNT flexibility. The high FORMOSAT-2 revisit frequency allowed next replicating the dynamics of albedo and LAI, and detecting to some extents cultural practices like vegetation cuts. It also allowed investigating possible relationships between albedo and LAI. The latter depicted specific trends according to vegetation types, and were very similar when derived from ground based data, remotely sensed observations or radiative transfer simulations. These relationships also depicted large albedo variabilities for low LAI values, which confirmed that estimating one variable from the other would yield poor performances for low vegetation cover with varying soil backgrounds. Finally, this empirical study demonstrated, in the context of exhaustively describing the spatiotemporal variability of surface properties, the potential synergy between 1) ground based web-sensors that continuously monitor specific biophysical variables over few locations, and 2) high spatial resolution satellite with high revisit frequencies.

AB Burn severity estimation is a key factor in the post-fire management. Previous studies using remotely sensed data to retrieve burn severity, as measured by the Composite Burn Index (CBI), have found inconsistencies, since spectral indices work well in some ecosystems but not in others. These inconsistencies may be caused by the lack of spectral uniqueness in the CBI definition, or by the performance of the spectral indices used. This paper analyses the former aspect, using a simulation analysis to study the relationships between the CBI and reflectance. Subsequently, a modified version of this index, called GeoCBI, is proposed to improve the retrieval of burn severity from remotely sensed data. GeoCBI takes into account the fraction of cover (FCOV) of the different vegetation strata used to compute the CBI. Moreover, it also includes the changes in the leaf area index (LAI) for the intermediate and tall tree strata (D+E). Field and simulation results show that GeoCBI is more consistently related to spectral reflectance than CBI for different ranges of burn severities, while keeping its ecological meaning.

AB Empirical algorithms based on first order relationships between ocean color and the chlorophyll concentration ([ChI]; mg m(-3)) are widely used, but cannot explain the statistical dispersion or "anomalies" around the mean trends. We use an empirical approach that removes the first order effects of [ChI] from satellite ocean color, thus allowing us to quantify the impact on the ocean color signal of optical anomalies that vary independently of the global mean trends with remotely sensed [ChI]. We then present statistical and modeling analyses to interpret the observed anomalies in terms of their optical sources (i.e. absorption and backscattering coefficients). We identify two main sources of second order variability for a given [ChI]: 1) the amount of non-algal absorption, especially due to colored dissolved organic matter; and 2) the amplitude of the backscattering coefficient of particles. The global distribution of the anomalies displays significant regional and seasonal trends, providing important information for characterizing the marine optical environment and for inferring biogeochemical influences. We subsequently use our empirically determined anomalies to estimate the backscattering coefficient of particles and the combined absorption coefficient for colored detrital and dissolved materials. This purely empirical approach provides an independent assessment of second order optical variability for comparison with existing methods that are generally based on semi-analytical models.

AB Live fuel moisture (LFM) is an important factor for ascertaining fire risk in shrublands located in Mediterranean climate regions. We examined empirical relationships between LFM and numerous vegetation indices calculated from MODIS composite data for two southern California shrub functional types, chaparral (evergreen) and coastal sage scrub (CSS, drought-deciduous). These relationships were assessed during the annual March-September dry down period for both individual sites, and sites pooled by functional type. The visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) consistently had the strongest relationships for individual site regressions. An independent method of accuracy assessment, cross validation. was used to determine model robustness for pooled site regressions. Regression models were developed with n-1 datasets and tested on the dataset that was withheld. Additional variables were included in the regression models to account for site-specific and interannual differences in vegetation amount and condition. This allowed a single equation to be used for a given functional type. Multiple linear regression models based on pooled sites had slightly lower adjusted R-2 values compared with simple linear regression models for individual sites. The best regression models for chaparral and CSS were inverted, and LFM was mapped across Los Angeles County, California (LAC). The methods used in this research show promise for monitoring LFM in chaparral and may be applicable to other Mediterranean shrubland communities. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study examines the effectiveness of using multi-temporal satellite imagery, field spectral data, and LiDAR top of canopy data to classify and map the common plant communities of the Ragged Rock Creek marsh, located near the mouth of the Connecticut River. Visible to near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance spectra were measured in the field over the 2004-2006 growing seasons to assess the phenological variability of the dominant marsh plant species, Spartina patens, Phragmites australis and Typha spp. Phragmites was best distinguished from other species by its high NIR response late in the growing season. Typha spp. had a high red/green ratio and S. patens had a unique green/blue ratio relative to other species throughout the bulk of the growing season. The field spectra and single date (2004) LiDAR canopy height data were used to define an object-oriented classification methodology for the three plant communities in multi-temporal QuickBird multispectral imagery collected over the same time interval. The classification was validated using an extensive field inventory of marsh species. Overall maximum fuzzy accuracy for the classification was 97% for Phragmites, 63% for Typha spp. and 80% for S. patens meadows and improved to 97%, 76%. and 92%, respectively, using a fuzzy acceptable match measure. This study demonstrated the importance of the timing of image acquisition for the identification of targeted plant species in a heterogeneous marsh. These datasets and protocols may provide coastal resource managers, municipal officials and researchers a set of recommended guidelines for remote sensing data collection for marsh inventory and monitoring.

AB High backscatter reflectance at NIR wavelengths has been observed for reindeer lichens (Cladina sp.) in the laboratory. The results suggested that lichens could be separated from soil and other parts of forest understory using this property. An experiment was carried out to test this hypothesis in situ. The lichen vegetation of a 960-m(2) plot in a barren pine stand in Juupajoki, Finland was mapped in 3D, using methods of close-range photogrammetry. The data of two airborne discrete-return sensors were compared for their ability to classify understory lichen vegetation. Normalization of the LiDAR intensities was carried out, using natural targets. The results showed that lichen surfaces had a higher intensity than on average. Normalization of the intensities improved separability of lichens from other surfaces, and the best-case classification accuracy was 75%. Detailed analysis of geometric errors revealed small, decimeter-level planimetric offsets in the LiDAR datasets that affected the results notably. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc, All rights reserved.

AB The homogeneity of time series of satellite images is crucial when studying abrupt or gradual changes in vegetation cover via remote sensing data. Various sources of noise affect the information received by satellites, making it difficult to differentiate the surface signal from noise and complicates attempts to obtain homogeneous time series. We compare different procedures developed to create homogeneous time series of Landsat images, including sensor calibration, atmospheric and topographic correction, and radiometric normalization. Two seasonal time series of Landsat images were created for the middle Ebro Valley (NE Spain) covering the period 1984-2007. Different processing steps were tested and the best option selected according to quantitative statistics obtained from invariant areas, simultaneous medium-resolution images, and field measurements. The optimum procedure includes cross-calibration between Landsat sensors, atmospheric correction using complex radiative transfer models, a non-lambertian topographic correction, and a relative radiometric normalization using an automatic procedure. Finally, three case studies are presented to illustrate the role of the different radiometric correction procedures when analyzing and explaining gradual and abrupt temporal changes in vegetation cover, as well as temporal variability. We have shown that to analyze different vegetation processes with Landsat data, it is necessary to accurately ensure the homogeneity of the multitemporal datasets by means of complex radiometric correction procedures. Failure to follow such a procedure may mean that the analyzed processes are non-recognizable and that the obtained results are invalid. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study is to derive parameters from spectral variations associated with heavy metals in soil and to explore the possibility of extending the use of these parameters to hyperspectral images and to map the distribution Of areas affected by heavy metals on HyMAP data. Variations in the spectral absorption features of lattice CH and oxygen on the mineral Surface due to the combination of different heavy metals were linked to actual concentrations of heavy metals. The ratio of 610 to 500 nnn (R-610,R-500 nm) in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) range, absorption area at 2200 nm (Area(2200 nm)), and asymmetry of the absorption feature at 2200 nm (ASYM(2200 nm)) showed significant correlations with concentrations of Pb, Zn, and As, respectively. The resulting spectral gradient maps showed similar spatial patterns to geochemical gradient maps. The ground-derived spectral Parameters showed a reliable quantitative relationship with heavy metal levels based on multiple linear regression. To examine the feasibility to applying these parameters to a HyMAP image, image-derived spectral parameters were compared with ground-derived parameters in terms of R-2, one-way ANOVA, and spatial patterns in the gradient map. The R-1344,R-778 nm and Area(2200 nm) parameters showed a weak relationship between the two datasets (R-2 > 0.5), and populations of spectral parameter values, Depth(500 nm) R-1344,R-778 nm, and Area(2200 nm) derived from the image pixels were comparable with those of ground-derived spectral parameters along a section of the stream channel. The pixels classified in the rule image of Depth(500 nm), R-1344,R-778 nm, and Area(2200 nm), derived from a HyMAP image showed similar spatial patterns to the gradient maps of ground-derived spectral parameters. The results indicate the potential applicability of the parameters derived from spectral absorption features in Screening and mapping the distribution of heavy metals. Correcting for differences in spectral and spatial resolution between ground and image spectra should be considered for quantitative mapping and the retrieval of heavy metal concentrations from HyMAP images.

AB We show that observed co-variations at sub-hourly time scales between the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and canopy light use efficiency (LUE) over a Douglas-fir forest result directly from sub-hourly leaf reflectance changes in a 531 mm spectral window roughly 50 nm wide. We conclude then, that over a forest stand we are observing the direct effects of photosynthetic down-regulation on leaf-level reflectance at 531 nm. Key to our conclusion is our ability to simultaneously measure the LUE and reflectance of the Douglas-fir stand as a function of shadow fraction from the "hot spot" to the "dark spot" and a new finding herein, based on radiative transfer theory, that the magnitude of a normalized reflectance difference index (NDRI) such as PRI can vary with shadow fraction only in case the reflectance of the shaded and sunlit leaves differ in at least one of the NDRI bands.
   Our spectrometer measurements over a nearly 6 month period show that at a forest stand scale, only two NDRIs (both containing a band near 570 nm) vary with shadow fraction and are correlated with LUE: an NDRI with a band centered at 531 nm roughly 50 nm wide, and another near 705 nm. Therefore, we are able to conclude that only these two bands' reflectance differ between the sunlit and the shaded elements of the canopy. Their reflectance changes on time scales of a few minutes or less. Our observations also show that the reflectance changes at 531 nm are more highly correlated with variations in canopy light use efficiency when only sunlit canopy elements are viewed (the hot spot), than when only shaded elements (the dark spot) are viewed. Taken together then, these results demonstrate that the observed sub-hourly changes in foliage reflectance at 531 nm and 705 turn can only result from corresponding variations in photosynthetic rates. The importance of our results are as follows: (1) We show that variations in PRI with LUE are a direct result of rapid changes in foliage reflectance at 531 nm resulting from photosynthetic down-regulation, and can be observed at forest scales. (2) Our findings also suggest a new sensor and methodology for the direct retrieval from space of changes in forest LUE by measuring PRI as a function of shadow fraction using a multi-angle spectrometer simultaneously retrieving both shadow fraction and PRI.

AB In this paper a cloud detection algorithm applied to the MSG-SEVIRI (Metcosat Second Generation-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) data is described. In order to obtain a good performance in cloud detection, physical, statistical and temporal approaches have been used. In the statistical algorithm, the spectral and textural features of the MSG-SEVIRI images have been used as input, while, in the physical tests, a set of dynamic thresholds has been used. The physical algorithm does not use real time ancillary data- such as sea surface temperature map and NWP temperature and humidity profiles. A further test is applied to that pixels having low confidence to be clear or cloudy. This test takes advantage of the best MSG-SEVIRI temporal resolution and it applies the K-Nearest Neighbour classifier to the spectral and textural features calculated in "temporal" boxes 3 x 3 pixels, defined "temporal" because their elements belong to three subsequent MSG-SEVIRI images. The MACSP (cloud MAsk Coupling of Statistical and Physical methods) algorithm has been validated against the MODIS cloud mask and compared with CPR (Cloud Profiling Radar) and SAFNWC cloud masks. The outcomes show that the MACSP detects 91.8% of the total number of the pixels used for validation against MODIS cloud mask correctly, while the SAFNWC cloud mask detects 89.2% of them correctly. In particular, the MACSP classifies as cloudy 8.8% of the pixels classified by the MODIS cloud mask as clear, while the SAFNWC cloud mask classifies as cloudy 12.1% of them. The MACSP detects 91.2% of the cloudy CPR pixels and 90.8% of the cloud-free CPR pixels, considered for comparison, correctly. On the other hand, the SAFNWC and CPR cloud masks agree in the detection of 90.7% of the cloudy pixels and of 90.2% of the cloud-free pixels. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Optimal estimation (OE) improves sea surface temperature (SST) estimated from satellite infrared imagery in the "split-window", in comparison to SST retrieved using the usual multi-channel (MCSST) or non-linear (NLSST) estimators. This is demonstrated using three months of observations of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on the first Meteorological Operational satellite (Metop-A), matched in time and space to drifter SSTs collected on the global telecommunications system. There are 32,175 matches. The prior for the OE is forecast atmospheric fields from the Meteo-France global numerical weather prediction system (ARPEGE), the forward model is RTTOV8.7, and a reduced state vector comprising SST and total column water vapour (TCWV) is used. Operational NLSST coefficients give mean and standard deviation (SD) of the difference between satellite and drifter SSTs of 0.00 and 0.72 K. The "best possible" NLSST and MCSST coefficients, empirically regressed on the data themselves, give zero mean difference and SDs of 0.66 K and 0.73 K respectively. Significant contributions to the global SD arise from regional systematic errors (biases) of several tenths of kelvin in the NLSST. With no bias corrections to either prior fields or forward model, the SSTs retrieved by OE minus drifter SSTs have mean and SD of -0.16 and 0.49 K respectively. The reduction in SD below the "best possible" regression results shows that OE deals with structural limitations of the NLSST and MCSST algorithms. Using simple empirical bias corrections to improve the OE, retrieved minus drifter SSTs are obtained with mean and SD of -0.06 and 0.44 K respectively. Regional biases are greatly reduced, such that the absolute bias is less than 0.1 K in 61 % of 10 degrees-latitude by 30 degrees-longitude cells. OE also allows a statistic of the agreement between modelled and measured brightness temperatures to be calculated. We show that this measure is more efficient than the current system of confidence levels at identifying reliable retrievals, and that the best 75% of satellite SSTs by this measure have negligible bias and retrieval error of order 0.25 K.

AB Image differences between Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data and other Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are often performed for either accuracy assessment or for estimating vegetation height across the landscape. It has been widely assumed that the effect of sub-pixel misregistration between the two models on resultant image differences is negligible, yet this has not previously been tested in detail. The aim of this study was to determine the impact that various levels of misregistration have on image differences between SRTM and DEMs. First, very accurate image co-registration was performed at two study sites between higher resolution DEMs and SRTM data, and then image differences (SRTM-DEM) were performed after various levels of misregistration were systematically introduced into the SRTM data. It was found that: (1) misregistration caused an erroneous and dominant correlation between elevation difference and aspect across the landscape; (2) the direction of the misregistration defined the direction of this erroneous and systematic elevation difference; (3) for sub-pixel misregistration the error due solely to misregistration was greater than, or equal to the true difference between the two models for substantial proportions of the landscape (e.g., greater than 33% of the area for a half-pixel misregistration); and(4)the strength of the erroneous relationship with aspect was enhanced by steeper terrain. Spatial comparisons of DEMs were found to be sensitive to even sub-pixel misregistration between the two models, which resulted in a strong erroneous correlation with aspect. This misregistration induced correlation with aspect is not likely specific to SRTM data only; we expect it to be a generic relationship present in any DEM image difference analysis.

AB We present a generic innovative algorithm for remote sensing of coastal waters that can deal with a large range of concentrations of chlorophyll-a, SPM and CDOM and their inherent optical properties. The algorithm is based on the exact solutions of the HYDROLIGHT numerical radiative transfer model to support retrieval in optically complex waters with varying sensor wide swath viewing geometry. The algorithm estimates the concentrations by minimizing the difference between observed and modeled reflectance spectra. The use of a look-up table and polynomial interpolation greatly reduces computation time, allowing operational and near-real time processing of large sets of satellite imagery. Because the remote sensing reflectance was tabulated as a function of in-water light absorption and scattering, rather than actual constituents concentrations, the algorithm can be applied with any definition of the specific inherent optical properties of CHL, SPM and CDOM. A statistical measure for the goodness-of-fit and the formal standard errors in the fitted concentrations are provided, thus producing error maps with each thematic chlorophyll image, often lacking in most applications of innovative algorithms. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated for multispectral observations of the North Sea, a shallow coastal sea with large concentration gradients in SPM (due to resuspension) and CDOM (from riverine influx). The standard errors of estimated chlorophyll-a concentrations ranged between 0.5 and 3 (mg to 3) for mean concentrations between 2 and 20 (mg m(-3)), quite acceptable results for these optically complex waters.

AB An automated method was developed for mapping forest cover change using satellite remote sensing data sets. This multi-temporal classification method consists of a training data automation (TDA) procedure and uses the advanced support vector machines (SVM) algorithm. The TDA procedure automatically generates training data using input satellite images and existing land cover products. The derived high quality training data allow the SVM to produce reliable forest cover change products. This approach was tested in 19 study areas selected from major forest biomes across the globe. In each area a forest cover change map was produced using a pair of Landsat images acquired around 1990 and 2000. High resolution IKONOS images and independently developed reference data sets were available for evaluating the derived change products in 7 of those areas. The overall accuracy values were over 90% for 5 areas, and were 89.4% and 89.6% for the remaining two areas. The user's and producer's accuracies of the forest loss class were over 80% for all 7 study areas, demonstrating that this method is especially effective for mapping major disturbances with low commission errors. IKONOS images were also available in the remaining 12 study areas but they were either located in non-forest areas or in forest areas that did not experience forest cover change between 1990 and 2000. For those areas the IKONOS images were used to assist visual interpretation of the Landsat images in assessing the derived change products. This visual assessment revealed that for most of those areas the derived change products likely were as reliable as those in the 7 areas where accuracy assessment was conducted. The results also suggest that images acquired during leaf-off seasons should not be used in forest cover change analysis in areas where deciduous forests exist. Being highly automatic and with demonstrated capability to produce reliable change products, the TDA-SVM method should be especially usefial for quantifying forest cover change over large areas.

AB Spatially distributed estimates of evaporative fraction and actual evapotranspiration are pursued using a simple remote sensing technique based on a remotely sensed vegetation index (NDVI) and diumal changes in land surface temperature. The technique, known as the triangle method, is improved by utilizing the high temporal resolution of the geostationary MSG-SEVIRI sensor. With 15 min acquisition intervals, the MSG-SEVIRI data allow for a precise estimation of the morning rise in land surface temperature which is a strong proxy for total daytime sensible heat fluxes. Combining the diumal change in surface temperature, dT(s) with an interpretation of the triangular shaped dT(s)-NDVI space allows for a direct estimation of evaporative fraction. The mean daytime energy available for evapotranspiration (R. - G) is estimated using several remote sensors and limited ancillary data. Finally regional estimates of actual evapotranspiration are made by combining evaporative fraction and available energy estimates. The estimated evaporative fraction (EF) and actual evapotranspiration (ET) for the Senegal River basin have been validated against field observations for the rainy season 2005. The validation results showed low biases and RMSE and R-2 of 0.13 [-] and 0.63 for EF and RMSE of 41.45 W m(-2) and R-2 of 0.66 for ET. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Although a variety of hierarchical image segmentation procedures for remote sensing imagery have been published, none of them specifically integrates remote sensing time series in spatial or hierarchical segmentation concepts. However, this integration is important for the analysis of ecosystems which are hierarchical in nature, with different ecological processes occurring at different spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to introduce a multi-temporal hierarchical image segmentation (MTHIS) methodology to generate a hierarchical set of segments based on spatial similarity of remote sensing time series. MTHIS employs the similarity of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) components of multi-seasonal time series to group pixels with similar temporal behavior into hierarchical segments at different scales. Use of the FFT allows the distinction between noise and vegetation related signals and increases the computational efficiency. The MTHIS methodology is demonstrated on the area of South Africa in an MTHIS protocol for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. Firstly, the FFT components that express the major spatio-temporal variation in the NDVI time series, the average and annual term, are selected and the segmentation is performed based on these components. Secondly, the results are visualized by means of a boundary stability image that confirms the accuracy of the algorithm to spatially group pixels at different scale levels. Finally, the segmentation optimum is determined based on discrepancy measures which illustrate the correspondence of the applied MTHIS output with landcover-landuse maps describing the actual vegetation. In future research, MTHIS can be used to analyze the spatial and hierarchical structure of any type of remote sensing time series and their relation to ecosystem processes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB The monitoring of earth surface processes at a global scale requires high temporal frequency remote sensing observations provided up to now by moderate spatial resolution sensors (from 250 m to 7 kin). Non-linear estimation processes of land surface variables derived from remote sensing data can be biased by the surface spatial heterogeneity within the moderate spatial resolution pixel. Quantifying this surface spatial heterogeneity is thus required to correct non-linear estimation processes of land surface variables. The first step in this process is to properly characterize the scale of spatial variation of the processes structuring the landscape. Since the description of land surface processes generally involves various spectral bands, a multivariate approach to characterize the surface spatial heterogeneity from multi-spectral remote sensing observations has to be established.
   This work aims at quantifying the landscape spatial heterogeneity captured by red and near infrared high spatial resolution images using direct and cross-variograms modeled together with the geostatistical linear model of coregionalization. This model quantifies the overall spatial variability and correlation of red and near infrared reflectances over the scene. In addition, it provides an explicit understanding of the landscape spatial structures captured by red and near infrared reflectances and is thus appropriate to describe landscapes composed of areas with contrasted red and near infrared spectral properties.
   The application of the linear model of coregionalization to 18 contrasted landscapes provides a spatial signature of red and near infrared spectral properties characterizing each type of landscape. Low vegetation cover sites are characterized by positive spatial correlation between red and near infrared. The mosaic pattern of vegetation fields and bare soil fields over crop sites generates high and negative spatial correlation between red and near infrared and increases the spatial variability of red and near infrared. On forest sites, the important amount of vegetation limits the spatial variability of red and the shadow effects mainly captured by near infrared induce a low and positive spatial correlation between red and near infrared.
   Finally, the linear model of coregionalization applied to red and near infrared is shown to be more powerful than the univariate variogram modeling applied to NDVI because the second order stationarity hypothesis on which variogram modeling relies is more frequently verified for red and near infrared than for NDVI.

AB Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) is a principle mediator of global terrestrial CO2 uptake and water vapor loss through plant stomata. As such, methods to estimate VPD accurately and efficiently are critical for ecosystem and climate modeling efforts. Based on prior work relating energy partitioning, remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST), and VPD, we developed simple linear models to predict VPD using saturated vapor pressure calculated from MODIS LST at a number of different temporal and spatial resolutions. We developed and assessed the LST-VPD models using three data sets: (1) instantaneous and daytime average ground-based VPD and radiometric temperature from the Soil Moisture Experiments in 2002 (SMEX02); (2) daytime average VPD from AmeriFlux eddy covariance flux tower observations; and (3) estimated daytime average VPD from Global Surface Summary of Day (GSSD) observations. We estimated model parameters for VPD estimation both regionally (MODI I A2) and globally (MOD11 C2) with RMSE values ranging from .32 to .38 kPa. VPD was overestimated along coastlines and underestimated in and regions with low vegetation cover. Also, residuals were larger with higher VPDs because of the non-linear function of saturation vapor pressure with LST. Linear relationships were seen at multiple scales and appear useful for estimation purposes within a range of 0 to 2.5 kPa. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Radiation reflected from vegetation canopies exhibits high spatial variation. Satellite-bome sensors measure the mean intensities emanating from heterogeneous vegetated pixels. The theory of radiative transfer in stochastic media provides the most logical linkage between satellite observations and the three-dimensional canopy structure through a closed system of simple equations which contains the mean intensity and higher statistical moments directly as its unknowns. Although this theory has been a highly active research field in recent years, its potential for satellite remote sensing of vegetated surfaces has not been fully realized because of the lack of models of a canopy pair-correlation function that the stochastic radiative transfer equations require. The pair correlation function is defined as the probability of finding simultaneously phytoelements at two points. This paper presents analytical and Monte Carlo generated pair correlation functions. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that the spatial correlation between phytoelements is primarily responsible for the effects of the three-dimensional canopy structure on canopy reflective and absorptive properties. The pair correlation function, therefore, is the most natural and physically meaningful measure of the canopy structure over a wide range of scales. The stochastic radiative transfer equations naturally admit this measure and thus provide a powerful means to investigate the three-dimensional canopy structure from space. Canopy reflectances predicted by the stochastic equations are assessed by comparisons with the PARABOLA measurements from coniferous and broadleaf forest stands in the BOREAS Southern Study Areas. The pair correlation functions are derived from data on tree structural parameters collected during field campaigns conducted at these sites. The simulated canopy reflectances compare well with the PARABOLA data. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) is the first spaceborne lidar instrument for continuous global observation of the Earth. GLAS records a vertical profile of the returned laser energy from its footprint. To help understand the application of the data for forest spatial structure studies in our regional projects, an evaluation of the GLAS data was conducted using NASA's Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) data in an area near NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, USA. The tree height indices from airborne large-footprint lidars such as LVIS have been successfully used for estimation of forest structural parameters in many previous studies and served as truth in this study.
   The location accuracy of the GLAS footprints was evaluated by matching the elevation profile from GLAS with the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM. The results confirmed the location accuracy of the GLAS geolocation, and showed a high correlation between the height of the scattering phase center from SRTM and the top tree height from GLAS data. The comparisons between LVIS and GLAS data showed that the GLAS waveform is similar to the aggregation of the LVIS waveforms within the GLAS footprint, and the tree height indices derived from the GLAS and LVIS waveforms were highly correlated. The best correlations were found between the 75% waveform energy quartiles of LVIS and GLAS (r(2) =0.82 for October 2003 GLAS data, and r(2)=0.65 for June 2005 GLAS data). The correlations between the 50% waveform energy quartiles of LVIS and GLAS were also high (0.77 and 0.66 respectively). The comparisons of the top tree height and total length of waveform of the GLAS data acquired in fall of 2003 and early summer of 2005 showed a several meter bias. Because the GLAS footprints from these two orbits did not exactly overlap, several other factors may have caused this observed difference, including difference of forest structures, seasonal difference of canopy structures and errors in identifying the ground peak of waveforms.

AB In even-aged, single species conifer plantations LiDAR height data can be modelled to provide accurate estimates of tree height and volume. However, it is apparent that growth models developed for single species stands are not directly transferable to a more general situation of mixed species plantations. This paper evaluates the ability of small footprint, dual-return, pulsed airborne LiDAR data to estimate the proportion of the productive species when mixed with a nurse crop in closed canopy plantations. A study area located in Galloway Forest District in Scotland is used as an example of Lodgepole pine and Sitka spruce mixed plantation; this area contains good examples of a wide range of pure and mixed species plantation types. Three species groups are studied: areas of pure Sitka spruce, areas of pure Lodgepole pine and areas where the two species have been planted together. Two approaches are assessed for detection of plantation mixtures: the first uses LiDAR intensity data to separate spruce and pine species and the second uses LiDAR-derived canopy density measures, coefficient of variation, skewness, percent of ground returns (which provides a measure of canopy openness) and the mean canopy height, which enables areas with height variations to be identified. From analysis of LiDAR data extracted from 54 study plots using logistic regression, the coefficient of variation and LiDAR intensity data provide the most useful predictors of the proportion of spruce in a pine/spruce mixture with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.914 and 0.930 respectively. The method could be developed as a mapping tool, which in combination with existing inventory data should help to improve timber volume forecasting for mixed species even-aged plantations.

AB A modification to the maximum likelihood algorithm was developed for classification of forest types in Sweden's part of the CORINE land cover mapping project. The new method, called the "calibrated maximum likelihood classification" involves an automated and iterative adjustment of prior weights until class frequency in the output corresponds to class frequency as calculated from objective (field-inventoried) estimates. This modification compensates for the maximum likelihood algorithm's tendency to over-represent dominant classes and under-represent less frequent ones. National forest inventory plot data measured from a five-year period are used to estimate relative frequency of class occurrence and to derive spectral signatures for each forest class. The classification method was implemented operationally within an automated production system which allowed rapid production of a country-wide forest type map from Landsat TM/ETM+ satellite data. The production system automated the retrieval and updating of forest inventory plots, a plot-to-image matching routine, illumination and haze correction of satellite imagery, and classification into forest classes using the calibrated maximum likelihood classification. This paper describes the details of the method and demonstrates the result of using an iterative adjustment of prior weights versus unadjusted prior weights. It shows that the calibrated maximum likelihood algorithm adjusts for the overclassification of classes that are well represented in the training data as well as for other classes, resulting in an output where class proportions are close to those as expected based on forest inventory data.

AB High spatial resolution (similar to 100 m) thermal infrared band imagery has utility in a variety of applications in environmental monitoring. However, currently such data have limited availability and only at low temporal resolution, while coarser resolution thermal data (similar to 1000 m) are routinely available, but not as useful for identifying environmental features for many landscapes. An algorithm for sharpening thermal imagery (TsHARP) to higher resolutions typically associated with the shorter wavebands (visible and near-infrared) used to compute vegetation indices is examined over an extensive corn/soybean production area in central Iowa during a period of rapid crop growth. This algorithm is based on the assumption that a unique relationship between radiometric surface temperature (T-R) relationship and vegetation index (VI) exists at multiple resolutions. Four different methods for defining a VI-T-R basis function for sharpening were examined, and an optimal form involving a transformation to fractional vegetation cover was identified. The accuracy of the high-resolution temperature retrieval was evaluated using aircraft and Landsat thermal imagery, aggregated to simulate native and target resolutions associated with Landsat, MODIS, and GOES short- and longwave datasets. Applying TsHARP to simulated MODIS thermal maps at 1-km resolution and sharpening down to similar to 250 in (MODIS VI resolution) yielded root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.67-1.35 degrees C compared to the 'observed' temperature fields, directly aggregated to 250 m. Sharpening simulated Landsat thermal maps (60 and 120 m) to Landsat VI resolution (30 m) yielded errors of 1.8-2.4 degrees C, while sharpening simulated GOES thermal maps from 5 km to I km and 250 m yielded RMSEs of 0.98 and 1.97, respectively. These results demonstrate the potential for improving the spatial resolution of thermal-band satellite imagery over this type of rainfed agricultural region. By combining GOES thermal data with shortwave VI data from polar orbiters, thermal imagery with 250-m spatial resolution and 15-min temporal resolution can be generated with reasonable accuracy. Further research is required to examine the performance of TsHARP over regions with different climatic and land-use characteristics at local and regional scales. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB One important objective of the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) is retrieving global aerosol loading and microphysical properties. Accuracy depends on many factors, including the availability of a complete catalog of particle types with their associated size distributions, shapes, single-scattefing albedos, vertical profiles, and spectral radiative characteristics. Co-equal to this need is the availability of a well-designed, well-characterized instrument, with a calibration that is maintained post-launch. This allows accurate radiance and retrieval products to be made, adjusting for instrument changes. MISR performance has been intensively studied throughout the design, pre-flight, and post-launch mission phases. To establish the absolute radiometric scale, annual vicarious calibration (VC) exercises have been conducted. In addition, an on-board-calibrator (OBC) allows more frequent testing of camera degradations. Together, the VC and OBC processes have allowed MISR to achieve an absolute calibration uncertainty of 4% or better (la confidence level) for bright land targets. Additional fine-tunings have been made following analysis of lunar-view campaign data, and from a statistical analysis of Earth observations. These studies led to slight camera-to-camera adjustments, which are important in improving the aerosol retrieval process. Validation of the response at the lower end of the dynamic range has also been accomplished using a dark-water study. With these studies complete, MISR calibration is now in an operational mode, and data users can be assured the resulting data products are stable with time. Such records meet the needs of a program designed to support climate change and provide long-term monitoring of the Earth's atmosphere and radiative fluxes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB A neural network is developed to operationally estimate biophysical variables over land surfaces from the observations of the ENVISAT-MERIS instrument: the leaf area index (LAI), the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), the fraction of vegetation cover (fCover), and the canopy chlorophyll content (LAIxC(ab)). The neural network requires as input the geometry of observation and the top of canopy reflectances, corrected from the atmospheric effects, in eleven spectral bands. It is trained on a reflectance database made of radiative transfer model simulations. The principles underlying the generation of the database and the design of the network are first presented. The estimated variables are then compared to other existing products, LAI- and fAPAR-MODIS and MGVI-MERIS, and validated against ground measurements performed in the framework of the VALERI project. Results show remarkable consistency of the temporal dynamics between the several products with however some differences in the range of variation. When compared to actual VALERI ground measurements, the proposed algorithm shows the best performances for LAI (RMSE=0.47) and fAPAR (RMSE=0.09). (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using accurate inputs of wind speed is crucial in wind resource assessment, as predicted power is proportional to the wind speed cubed. First, wind speeds retrieved from a series of 91 ERS-2 SAR and Envisat ASAR images, at moderate wind speeds (2-15 in s(-1)), were validated against in situ measurements from an offshore mast in the North Sea. The wind direction input, necessary for SAR wind speed retrievals, was obtained from the meteorological mast and from a local gradient analysis of wind streaks in the SAR images. A wind speed standard deviation of similar to 1.1 in s(-1) was found when in situ wind directions were used. The use of local gradient wind directions yielded a standard deviation of similar to 1.3 in s(-1). Wind speeds retrieved from three geophysical model functions (CMOD-IFR2, CMOD4, and CMOD5) were compared. The best approximation to the in situ measurements of wind speed was found for CMOD-IFR2, despite a bias on the order of - 0.3 in s(-1). CMOD4 retrievals also underestimated the wind speed, whereas the bias on CMOD5 retrievals was negligible. Then, wind resource assessments were made from the SAR-based wind observations to show how errors in wind speed from the different SAR wind retrievals were reflected in the wind statistics. The mean wind speed, obtained for all of the 91 SAR scenes, was linked closely to the bias of SAR wind retrievals. Agreement to +/- 15% of the in situ measurements was found for all the wind retrieval methods tested. The accuracy of power density estimates for the entire data set was evaluated by the standard deviation of SAR wind retrievals relative to the in situ measurements. SAR wind fields retrieved with CMOD-IFR2, using in situ wind direction inputs, exactly yielded the power density predicted from in situ measurements alone. The SAR-based wind resource assessment also corresponded well to predictions from longer time series of in situ measurements. This indicates that a reliable wind resource assessment may be achieved from a series of randomly selected SAR images. The findings presented here could be useful in future wind resource assessment based on SAR images. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We investigate in this work the performance of the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) approach that is a Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) algorithm allowing the generation of mean deformation velocity maps and displacement time series from a data set of subsequently acquired SAR images. In particular, we have carried out a quantitative assessment of the SBAS procedure performance by processing SAR data acquired by the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) sensors and comparing the achieved results with geodetic measurements that are assumed as reference. The analysis has been focused on the Napoli bay (Italy) and Los Angeles (California) test areas where different deformation phenomena are present and, at the same time, a large amount of ERS SAR data is available as well as geometric leveling (in the Napoli zone) and continuous GPS (in the Los Angeles zone) measurements, to be used for our performance analysis. Moreover, due to the presence of large urbanized zones, the selected test sites are also characterized by extended, highly coherent areas in the DInSAR maps.
   The presented study shows that the SBAS technique provides an estimate of the mean deformation velocity with a standard deviation of about 1 mm/year for a typical ERS data set including between 40 and 60 images. Moreover, the single displacement measurements, computed with respect to a reference point of known motion, show a sub-centimetric accuracy with a standard deviation of about 5 mm, consistently in both the SAR/leveline and SAR/GPS comparisons; we also show that there is an increase of this standard deviation value as we move away from the reference SAR pixel, with an estimated spatial variation value of about 0.05 mm/km.

AB Persepolis is one of the well-known world heritage archeological sites dating back to the Achaemenian period (560-330 BC) located on the south-central of Iran. No study among the many has focused on precise recording of the territory of this site. The existence of a guard wall and watchtowers to protect this important centre is still in debate. To deal with this problem, a remote sensing data analysis, photogeology, and field survey are used. Remotely sensed air photos and satellite imagery have been shown to be a valuable tool for the characterization of the archeological landscape and locations of collapsed structure. The result of this study using air photos, ETM+, and TM images is indicative of a wall and watchtowers surrounding Persepolis. This could be subsequently confirmed with geophysical surveying and archaeological excavations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The invasive weed yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis) has infested between 4 and 6 million hectares in California. It often forms dense infestations and rapidly depletes soil moisture, preventing the establishment of other species. Precise assessment of its canopy cover, especially low-density abundance in the earlier growing season, is the key to effective management. Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager 2 (CASI-2) hyperspectral imagery was acquired at the western edge of California's Central Valley grasslands on July 15, 2003. Four linear spectral mixture models (LSMM) were investigated from the original CASI-2 data. Band selections based upon residual analysis and feature extraction (PCA) were further explored to reduce the data dimension. All approaches, except four band-selection unconstrained LSMMs, provide consistent results. The uncertainty of the PCA-based LSMM was estimated through a Monte-Carlo simulation. The maximum standard deviation was approximately 11%. The results suggest that unmixing CASI-2 imagery could be used for estimating and mapping yellow starthistle for larger regional areas.

AB In mixed-species forests of complex structure, the delineation of tree crowns is problematic because of their varying dimensions and reflectance characteristics, the existence of several layers of canopy (including understorey), and shadowing within and between crowns. To overcome this problem, an algorithm for delineating tree crowns has been developed using eCognition Expert and hyperspectral Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI-2) data acquired over a forested landscape near Injune, central east Queensland, Australia. The algorithm has six components: 1) the differentiation of forest, non-forest and understorey; 2) initial segmentation of the forest area and allocation of segments (objects) to larger objects associated with forest spectral types (FSTs); 3) initial identification of object maxima as seeds within these larger objects and their expansion to the edges of crowns or clusters of crowns; 4) subsequent classification-based separation of the resulting objects into crown or cluster classes; 5) further iterative splitting of the cluster classes to delineate more crowns; and 6) identification and subsequent merging of oversplit objects into crowns or clusters. In forests with a high density of individuals (e.g., regroAqh), objects associated with tree clusters rather than crowns are delineated and local maxima counted to approximate density. With reference to field data, the delineation process provided accuracies > similar to 70% (range 48-88%) for individuals or clusters of trees of the same species with diameter at breast height (DBH) exceeding 10 cm (senescent and dead trees excluded), with lower accuracies associated with dense stands containing several canopy layers, as many trees were obscured from the view of the CASI sensor. Although developed using I-m spatial resolution CASI data acquired over Australian forests, the algorithm has application elsewhere and is currently being considered for integration into the Definiens product portfolio for use by the wider community.

TI Spatio-temporal distribution of rice phenology and cropping systems in
   the Mekong Delta with special reference to the seasonal water flow of
   the Mekong and Bassac rivers
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DE MODIS; land-use change; phenology detection; flood; salinity intrusion
AB Multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data was used to estimate the spatial distribution of heading date and rice-cropping system employed in the Mekong Delta relative to seasonal changes in water resources in 2002 and 2003. We improved a Wavelet-based Filter for determining Crop Phenology (WFCP) and developed a Wavelet-based Filter for evaluating the spatial distribution of Cropping Systems (WFCS) to the interpretation of MODIS time-series data to determine the spatial distribution of rice phenology and various rice-cropping systems from the seasonal Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data. The findings correspond well the physical characteristics of the cropping system in the Mekong Delta, which have changed over time in response to localized and seasonal changes in water resources. One such example is the double-irrigated rice-cropping system commonly employed in the upper Mekong Delta in the dry season to avoid damage due to the subsequent floods. The shortage of suitable irrigation water and intrusion of saline water in the coastal regions during the dry season has constrained the practice dry-season cropping and has meant that the double- and single-rainfed rice-cropping systems are employed in the rainy season. A triple-irrigated rice-cropping system is used in the central part of the Mekong Delta which is located midway between the flood-prone and salinity intrusion areas. Analysis of annual changes in the rice cropping systems between 2002 and 2003 showed that the triple-cropped rice expanded to the flood- and salinity-intrusion areas. This expansion indicates that the implementation of measures to limit the extent of flooding and salinity intrusion by improved farming technologies and improvements in land management. The heading dates in the upper Mekong Delta in 2003 were earlier than in 2002 by approximately 20 to 30 days. The reasons for this would be due to decreased flood runoff in 2002 compared to 2001, and implementation of government policies regarding early sowing of dry-season crops. Subsequent analysis of the MODIS data confirmed that the spatial distribution of rice-cropping systems was closely related to seasonal changes in river runoff regime in the Mekong Delta.

AB The relationships between ecosystem-level light use efficiency (LUE) obtained from an eddy covariance flux tower and MODIS-derived values of a scaled Photochemical Reflectance Index (sPRI) were investigated for a boreal aspen stand (Populus tremuloides Michx.) in Saskatchewan, Canada. Using MODIS ocean band 11 at 531 nm, we tried to detect variations in canopy reflectance related to the xanthophyll cycle. We tested several other MODIS bands as the reference band because the 570 nm reference band that had been determined to be optimum for calculating PRI in earlier studies is not available on MODIS.
   While LUE varied greatly within the 2001, 2002, and 2003 growing seasons, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from tower sensors remained stable. LUE had a negative exponential relationship with vapor pressure deficit and air temperature, and was at a maximum when absorbed PAR was <200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The range and magnitude of tower-based LUE values were smaller on clear days, when MODIS acquisitions were possible, than they were overall. Furthermore, the orbital parameters of the Terra and Aqua satellites restricted MODIS acquisitions to a 2.5-h period in early afternoon at out study site when LUE values were typically lower than they were earlier in the day.
   Strong correlations between MODIS-sPRI and LUE were found only for backscatter reflectance scenes when band 13 (667 nm) was used as the reference band. The correlations were higher for sPRI calculated from top of atmosphere reflectances than for surface reflectances (r(2) = 0.76 and 0.53, respectively). The absolute backscatter reflectance of bands 11, 12 (551 nm), and 13 all decreased with increasing LUE. The decrease in band 13 suggests that the correlation between sPRI and LUE that we observed was caused by reductions in canopy chlorophyll content from 2001 to 2003 and/or by increased visibility of brighter non-photosynthetic material. Regional values of sPRI from 260 deciduous forest pixels in the 10,000 km(2) Vicinity of the tower for two contrasting days, one in 2001 and one in 2003, were consistent with that observed for the flux tower footprint.

AB Landsat satellite data has become ubiquitous in regional-scale forest disturbance detection. The Tasseled Cap (TC) transformation for Landsat data has been used in several disturbance-mapping projects because of its ability to highlight relevant vegetation changes. We used an automated composite analysis procedure to test four multi-date variants of the TC transformation (called "data structures" here) in their ability to facilitate identification of stand-replacing disturbance. Data structures tested included one with all three TC indices (brightness, greenness, wetness), one with just brightness and greenness, one with just wetness, and one called the Disturbance Index (DI) which is a novel combination of the three TC indices. Data structures were tested in the St. Petersburg region of Russia and in two ecologically distinct regions of Washington State in the US. In almost all cases, the TC variants produced more accurate change classifications than multi-date stacks of the original Landsat reflectance data. In general, there was little overall difference between the TC-derived data structures. However, DI performed better than the others at the Russian study area, where slower succession rates likely produce the most durable disturbance signal. Also, at the highly productive western Washington site, where the disturbance signal is likely the most ephemeral, DI and wetness performed worse than the larger data structures when a longer monitoring interval was used (eight years between image acquisitions instead of four). This suggests that both local forest recovery rates and the re-sampling interval should be considered in choosing a Landsat transformation for use in stand-replacing disturbance detection.

AB A new operational non-satellite-specific algorithm for the simultaneous retrieval from satellite data of phytoplankton chlorophyll content (chl), suspended minerals (sm), and dissolved organics (doe) in both clear and turbid waters is presented. It contains an array of neural networks providing input for the Levenberg -Marquardt multivariate optimization procedure as the final retrieval tool. With a given accuracy threshold, the developed algorithm is sufficiently robust for data with noise up to 15% for certain hydro-optical conditions. To avoid inadequate retrieval results, the algorithm identifies and eventually discards the pixels with inadequate atmospheric correction and/or water optical properties incompatible with the applied hydro-optical model. The validity of the developed algorithm was tested for Lake Michigan. Two dedicated field campaigns in the vicinity of the Kalamazoo River mouth have been conducted concurrently or quasi-concurrently with SeaWiFS and MODIS overpasses. In addition, some archival shipborne measurements of mostly chl and occasionally sm and doe were employed to validate the facility of the algorithm. Notwithstanding the aforementioned shipborne data limitations, the conducted comparison of the ground truth and retrieved data on the water quality parameters in Lake Michigan is strongly indicative of the algorithm's operational efficiency.

AB The Hawaiian Islands contain more than two-thirds of the life zones delineated by Holdridge, L.R., 1947. Determination of world plant formations from simple climate data. Science, 105, 367-368, and is thus an ideal testing ground for remote sensing studies of ecosystem function and structure. We tested the generality of imaging spectroscopy with "tied" red-edge and shortwave-infrared (RESWIR2) spectral mixture modeling for automated analysis of the lateral distribution of plant tissues and bare substrate across diverse bioclimatic gradients in Hawai'i. Unique quantities of the fractional cover of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation (PV, NPV) and bare substrate identified fundamental differences in ecosystem Structure across life zones. There was a similar to 20-fold increase in fractional PV cover with a 10-fold increase in inean annual precipitation (<= 250-2000 mm year(-1)). This rate of increase diminished from 2000 to 3000 mm year(-1) of rainfall, suggesting that photosynthetic canopy cover may be limited by water saturation at 3000 mm year(-1). The amount of exposed surface senescent material (NPV) remained nearly constant at similar to 50% in ecosystems with a mean annual precipitation < 1500 mm year(-1). Thereafter, NPV steadily declined to a minimum of similar to 20% at 3000 mm year(-1) of rainfall. Bare substrate fractions were highest (similar to 50%) at precipitation levels < 750 mm year(-1), then declined to < 20% in the 750-1000 mm year(-1) zones. The combination of low bare substrate and high NPV cover in the 750-1000 mm year-1 rainfall zones identified these areas as high fire risk. Remotely sensed fractional cover of PV+NPV was poorly correlated with canopy leaf area index (LAI), showing the uniqueness of the lateral structural measurement afforded by automated RE-SWIR2 spectroscopy approaches. The results indicate the accuracy, precision and applicability of imaging spectroscopy for ecological research across a wide range of bioclimatic conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB We evaluated 13 remotely sensed indices across four wildfire burn sites in interior Alaska. The indices included single bands, band ratios, vegetation indices, and multivariate components. Each index was evaluated with post-burn and differenced pre/post-burn index values. The indices were evaluated by examining the correlation between each remotely sensed index and field-based Composite Burn Index (CBI) values. Radiant temperature was strongly correlated with field-based CBI when a post-fire image from autumn was used. Indices that used red and near-infrared bands performed poorly relative to indices that incorporated mid-infrared bands. The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), which incorporates near- and mid-infrared bands, was ranked within the top three indices for each of the four burns using post-burn images, and for three of the four burns using pre- and post-burn images. When indices were summed based on ranked correlations, the NBR was highest for both the post-burn and pre/post-burn approaches. The NBR had high correlations with the field-based CBI in closed needleleaf, mixed, and broadleaf forest classes. However, the NBR was useful as an index of burn severity only for forested sites. The correlation between NBR and field-based CBI was low in non-forested classes such as woodland, scrub, and herb land cover classes. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Relative radiometric normalization has long been performed to generate consistency among individual Landsat scenes for production of composites containing multiple scenes. Normalization methods have relied on matching identical and assumed invariant features in both images of an overlapping pair, or on invariant targets that are not necessarily the same features. Problems with overlap normalization methods include sensitivity to outliers in overlap data caused by atmospheric or land cover change between scenes, which can lead to radiometric error propagation across a mosaic caused by a normalized scene becoming a reference for the subsequent scene entered into the mosaic. Solutions to such problems include interactive Outlier removal to generate a non-nalization function using a ' no change ' data set and methods that are robust against outliers to automatically generate normalization functions with minimal user input. This paper compares two normalization methods that use a robust regression technique called Theil-Sen with an established overlap normalization method. The first method uses Theil-Sen regression to generate a nonnalization function between overlap regions, while the second uses Theil-Sen to normalize to coarse-resolution composite reflectance data from the SPOT VEGETATION (VGT) sensor. The results of the normalizations were evaluated in two ways: (1) using statistics generated between overlap regions; and (2) separately using coarse-resolution data as a reference. Both overlap normalization methods performed almost identically; however, Theil-Sen was faster and easier to implement than its traditional counterpart due to its insensitivity to outliers and capability for full automation. While overlap and coarse-resolution normalizations each outperformed the other when evaluated against its calibration set, error propagation caused by outliers in overlap samples was avoided in the normalization to coarse-resolution imagery. Advantages offered by normalization to coarse-resolution data using robust regression, including full automation, make this method particularly attractive for generation of large area mosaics containing 100 Landsat scenes or more.

ID SEA-SURFACE TEMPERATURE; OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS; OCEAN; INSOLATION;
   ALGORITHM
AB Different methodologies to estimate the amplitude of the sea surface temperature diurnal variation (DV) and remove it from remotely sensed SST images have been proposed in the last years. Among these, the parameterization proposed by Stuart-Menteth et al. (2004a,b) [Stuart-Menteth, A.C., Robinson, I.S., & Weller, R.A. (2004a). Sensitivity of the diurnal warm layer to meteorological fluctuations Part 1: observations, submitted to Journal of Atmospheric and Ocean Science; Stuart-Menteth, A.C., Robinson, I. S., & Donlon, C.J. (2004b). Sensitivity of the diurnal warm layer to meteorological fluctuations Part 2: a new parameterisation for diurnal warming, submitted to Journal of Atmospheric and Ocean Science] and adopted by the GHRSST-PP (Donlon, 2004) [Donlon, C.J., ad the GHRSST-PP Science Team, 2004: The GHRSST-PP data processing specification nu 1.0 (GDS nu 1.0, revision 1.5), GHRSST-PP Report N. 17, Published by the International GHRSST-PP Project Office, pp. 241] appeared as the most promising. In fact, it takes into account wind and insolation variations during the day, that effectively drive the SST diurnal cycle.
   This parameterization, has been tested on 6 months of NOAA-16 AVHRR images acquired and processed at CNR with Pathfinder algorithm. The tests evidenced some limits for a correct estimation of the DV in low-wind regimes for any insolation condition, and in high insolation regimes (> 600 W/m(2)) when the wind intensity increases or decreases of more than 2 m/s during the morning. The limits of applicability of the DV correction to NOAA-16 AVHRR data (at least for the Mediterranean area) were thus identified, and data outside these limits were flagged. However, some anomalous heating were not corrected even with these constraints, due to the lack of accuracy in the wind field used for the correction. As a result, a strategy to flag residual outliers in the corrected daily images has been developed, based on the comparison to an optimally interpolated night SST field of the previous day.

   isolation; accuracy assessment
ID DELINEATION
AB Automated individual tree isolation and species determination with high resolution multispectral imagery is becoming a viable forest survey tool. Application to old growth conifer forests offer unique technical issues including high variability in tree size and dominance, strong tree shading and obscuration, and varying ages and states of health. The capabilities of individual tree analysis are examined with two acquisitions of 70-cm resolution CASI imagery over a hemlock, amabilis fir, and cedar dominated old growth site on the west coast of Canada. Trees were delineated using the valley following approach of the Individual Tree Crown (ITC) software suite, classified according to species (hemlock, amabilis fir, and cedar) using object-based spectral classification and tested on a tree-for-tree basis against data derived from ground plots.
   Tree-for-tree isolation and species classification accuracy assessment, although often sobering, is important for portraying the overall effectiveness of species composition mapping using single tree approaches. This accuracy considers not only how well each tree is classified, but how well each automated isolation represents a true tree and its species. Omissions and commissions need to be included in overall species accuracy assessment. A structure of rules for defining isolation accuracy is developed and used. An example is given of a new approach to accuracy analysis incorporating both isolation and classification results (automated tree recognition) and the issues this presents.
   The automated tree isolation performed well on those trees that could be visually identified on the imagery using ground measured stem maps (approximately 50-60% of trees had a good match between manual and automated delineations). There were few omissions. Commission errors, i.e., automated isolations not associated with a delineated ground reference tree, were a problem (25%) usually associated with spurious higher intensity areas within shaded regions, which get confused in the process of trying to isolate shaded trees. Difficulty in classifying species was caused by: variability of the spectral signatures of the old growth trees within the same species, tree health, and trees partly or fully shaded by other trees. To accommodate this variability, several signatures were used to represent each species including shaded trees. Species could not be determined for the shaded cases or for the unhealthy trees and therefore two combined classes, a shaded class and unhealthy class with all species included, were used for further analysis. Species classification accuracy of the trees for which there was a good automated isolation match was 72%, 60%, and 40% for the non-shaded healthy hemlock, balsam, and cedar trees for the 1996 data. Equivalent accuracy for the 1998 imagery was 59% for hemlock, 80% for balsam, with only a few cedar trees being well isolated. If all other matches were considered an error in classification, species classification was poor (approximately 45% for balsam and hemlock, 25% for cedar). However, species classification accuracies incorporating the good isolation matches and trees for which there was a match of an isolations and reference tree but the match was not considered good were moderate (60%, 57%, and 38% for hemlock, balsam, and cedar from the 1996 data; 62%, 61%, and 89%, respectively, for the 1998 imagery).
   Automated tree isolation and species classification of old growth forests is difficult, but nevertheless in this example useful results were obtained. Crown Copyright (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Passive microwave sensors (PM) onboard satellites have the capability to provide global snow observations which are not affected by cloudiness and night condition (except when precipitating events are occurring). Furthermore, they provide information on snow mass. i.e., snow water equivalent (SWE), which is critically important for hydrological modeling and water resource management. However. the errors associated with the passive microwave measurements of SWE are well known but have not been adequately quantified thus far. Understanding these errors is important for correct interpretation of remotely sensed SWE and successful assimilation of such observations into numerical models.
   This study uses a novel approach to quantify these errors by taking into account various factors, that impact passive microwave responses from snow in various climatic/geographic regions. Among these factors are vegetation cover (particularly forest cover). snow morphology(crystal size), and errors related to brightness temperature calibration. A time-evolving retrieval algorithm that considers the evolution of snow crystals is formulated. An error model is developed based on the standard error estimation theory. This new algorithm and error estimation method is applied to the passive microwave data from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) during the 1990-1991 snow season to produce annotated error maps for North America. The algorithm has been validated for seven snow seasons (from 1988 to 1995) in taiga, tundra, alpine, prairie, and maritime regions of Canada using in situ SWE data from the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) and satellite passive microwave observations. An ongoing study is applying this methodology to passive microwave measurements: from Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR); future study will further refine and extend the analysis globally, and produce an improved SWE dataset of more than 25 years in length by combining SSMR and SSM/I measurements.

AB We present a procedure for estimating temporal persistence in Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. Our algorithm provides for the estimations of the tendencies of NDVI to increase or decrease starting from selected reference conditions by means of linear fits that cover time periods increasing at a 1-year rate. The times at which such trends change their sign (first return times) are estimated, and the distribution that best fits their histogram is determined. Such a distribution reflects the character, stationary or not, of NDVI changes and allows for estimating persistence probability and for quantifying possible characteristic time scales. In order to check the algorithm's performances, we estimated persistence probability at a 1.1-km resolution over the test site of Southern Italy and selected subareas. Histograms of return times aggregated according to vegetation classes were also analyzed. In all of the cases, we found the exponential decay taw that is typical of processes that attain to long-term stationary patterns. Estimated mean life times of decreasing processes were generally shorter than those characterizing the increasing ones. Our findings express a good ability of vegetation to recover from disturbances and to efficiently exploit resources. Overall, rather stable conditions seem to characterize the test site and local exceptions can be easily explained with independent ground data. The good agreement between our inferences and results from independent studies suggests that dynamics estimated from AVHRR data can provide interesting information on vegetation resilience and response to human/climate forcing. In particular, quantitative information can be a key tool for the characterization and parameterization of vegetation changes and for the development and validation of dynamical models.

AB This paper presents an empirical method for deriving fuel moisture content (FMC) for Mediterranean grasslands and shrub species based on multitemporal analysis of NOAA-AVHRR data. The results are based on 6 years of field measurements of FMC. The empirical function was derived from a 4-year series and includes multitemporal composites of AVHRR's normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface temperature (ST) values, as well as a function of the day of the year. It was tested using data from 2 other years on the same site as well as other sites with similar species but very distant from each other and with different elevation ranges. The results show that the model provides a consistent estimation of FMC, with high accuracies for all study sites and species considered, with r(2) values over 0.8 for both grasslands and shrub species. This performance enables the model to be used to derive spatial estimator of FMC, which is a key factor in operational fire danger management in Mediterranean conditions. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper presents a method for estimating parameters of a two-layer stratified ocean using satellite SAR images. According to weak nonlinearity shallow water theory, internal solitary waves (ISWs) in stratified oceans may be either depression or elevation waves, depending on the sign of the quadratic nonlinearity coefficient in the KdV equation. It has been confirmed that ISWs can convert their polarity when passing through a turning point, where the quadratic nonlinearity coefficient changes sign. For a two-layer stratified ocean, the turning point is located where the upper and lower layer depths are equal. The authors suggest that depression, elevation and broadening ISWs can be discerned according to their different signatures in SAR images. It is also found that a SAR image can record a continuous evolution process from depression to elevation ISWs in its spatial domain, under conditions of a spatially inhomogeneous ocean environment. Therefore, the upper and lower layer depths can be calculated by determining the polarity conversion of ISWs observed in satellite SAR images. Furthermore, the density difference between the upper and lower layers can also be estimated, when the wave speed is known. We extract ocean stratification parameters, including upper layer depth and density difference, from polarity conversion of ISWs observed in a RADARSAT-1 SAR image taken over the northeastern South China Sea. Comparing the estimated results with field measurements, we find that this method can estimate the upper layer depth with considerable success. In estimating the density difference between the upper and lower layers, it also gives a quite reasonable result. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We examined recent volcanic cloud events in the Western Pacific and Indonesian area, to validate the performance of remote sensing techniques used to support the International Airways Volcano Watch (IAVW). Five events were considered, during which eruptions from eight volcanoes injected ash into the upper troposphere or lower stratosphere. For one of the eruptions, at Miyakejima, Japan, at least five aircraft encountered volcanic ash Clouds, and the cost to three operators alone exceeded US $12,000,000 in aircraft repairs, diversions, and lost operating time. We performed 'reverse' absorption and 'pattern analysis' using GMS-5/VISSR, MODIS and AVHRR data, and we examined TOMS SO2 and Aerosol Index data, surface-based observations, pilot reports, and dispersion model output. Our results verify that the introduction of 'reverse' absorption using the geostationary GMS-5 platform significantly enhanced our capacity to monitor volcanic ash clouds in the region. In one case, we tracked an eruption cloud for approximately 80 It. The primary impediment to remote monitoring is the presence of overlying cloud, or substantial amounts of ice within the volcanic Clouds. TOMS data showed success in identifying volcanic clouds during these conditions. but was limited by the infrequency of observations. More effective future operation of the IAVW relies on developing complementary methods of volcanic cloud remote sensing, and greatly increasing the amount and quality of available surface and air observations. including observations of precursor activity. An understanding of the likely future limitations of remote sensing techniques will aid in the refining of IAVW procedures. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We use satellite data from different sensor systems to analyze and explain the causes, processes, and impacts of desertification in a Steppe grazing area in Syria, with the aim of supporting the formulation of a strategy for rehabilitating desertified areas. Through the mapping of parameters such as barley fields, eolian sand distribution, and drainage patterns from Thematic Mapper (TM) data, we identified barley cultivation as one major reason for increased sand erosion or its downhill deposition. With regard to the degradation of natural vegetation covers, we discriminate between climate-triggered and human-induced vegetation degradation by analyzing the natural response pattern of vegetation to rainfall. For the monitoring of vegetation covers, we used composited 10-day interval 8-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from 1981 to 1996. A consistently changing response of vegetation to rainfall over this time period, expressed in the residuals of the NDVImax/Rainfall linear regression calculations, is interpreted as nonclimate or human driven, where correlations between residuals and the time of their occurrence produce correlation coefficients >\0.6\. Pixels showing a negative temporal trend in residuals coincide with areas that are most heavily used by humans. Heavily used areas were located through detecting nomadic campsites from Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS)-1C data. By combining campsite distribution with census data, such as flock size, average annual offtake, and grazing habits, we assess grazing pressures and put them in relation to the natural resources. This information provided the basis for the definition of protected areas or rehabilitation plots, and for elaborating measures to support the Steppe dwellers. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC) has developed an operational snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval algorithm suite for western Canada that can be applied to both Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) data. Separate algorithms derive SWE for open environments, deciduous, coniferous, and sparse forest cover. A final SWE value represents the area-weighted average based on the proportional land cover within each pixel. The combined SSM/I and SMMR time series of dual polarized, multichannel, spacebome passive microwave brightness temperatures extends back to 1978, providing a lengthy time series for algorithm assessment. In this study, 5-day average (pentad) passive microwave-derived SWE imagery for 18 winter seasons (December, January, February 1978/79 through 1995/96) was compared to SWE estimates taken from a distributed network of surface measurements throughout western Canada.
   Results indicated both vegetative and snowpack controls on the performance of MSC algorithms. In regions of open and low-density forest cover, the in situ and passive microwave SWE data exhibited both strong agreement and similar levels of interannual variability. In locations where winter season SWE typically exceeded 75 mm, and/or dense vegetative cover was present, dataset agreement weakened appreciably, with little interannual variability in the passive microwave SWE retrievals. These results have important implications for extending the SWE monitoring capability of the MSC algorithm suite to northern regions such as the Mackenzie River basin.

AB A multi-spectral non-local (MSN) method is developed for advanced retrieval of boundary layer cloud properties from remote sensing data, as an alternative to the independent pixel approximation (IPA) method. The non-local method uses data at both the target pixel and neighboring pixels to retrieve cloud properties such as pixel-averaged cloud optical thickness and effective droplet radius. Radiance data to be observed from space were simulated by a three-dimensional (3D) radiation model and a stochastic boundary layer cloud model with two-dimensional (horizontal and vertical) variability in cloud liquid water and effective radius. An adiabatic assumption is used for each cloud column to model the geometrical thickness and vertical profiles of cloud liquid water content and effective droplet radius, neglecting drizzle and cloud brokenness for simplicity. The dependence of radiative smoothing and roughening on horizontal scale, optical thickness and single scattering albedo are investigated. Then, retrieval methods using 250-m horizontal resolution data onboard new generation satellites are discussed. The regression model for the MSN method was trained based on datasets from numerical simulations. The training was performed with respect to various domain averages of optical thickness and effective radius, because smoothing and roughening effects are strongly dependent on the two variables. Retrieval accuracy is discussed here with datasets independent of those used in the training, towards assessing the generality of the technique. It is demonstrated that retrieval accuracy of cloud optical thickness, which is often retrieved from single-spectral visible-wavelength data, is improved the most using neighboring pixel data and secondly using multi-spectral data, and ideally with both. When the IPA retrieval method is applied to optical thickness and effective radius, the root-mean-square relative errors can be 15-90%, depending on solar and view directions. In contrast, the MSN method has errors of 4-10%, which is smaller than IPA by a factor of 2 - 10. It is also suggested that the accuracy of the MSN method is insensitive to some assumptions in the inhomogeneous cloud input data used to train the regression model. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper is devoted to an original assimilation method used to derive the visible/near-infrared spectral reflectance properties of calibration reference desert areas selected in previous studies for their spatial uniformity and temporal stability. In the first step, an appropriate ground spectral reflectance model with a small number of parameters was defined. To this end, spectral bidirectional reflectance measurements of typical sands were analyzed. Then, an adjustment method using a heterogeneous set of satellite data acquired under similar conditions over a given reference site was applied to recover ground spectral model parameters. The robustness of the method is demonstrated using a simulated satellite level dataset generated with realistic errors and uncertainties. The last section describes application of the method to a real satellite dataset extracted from the SADE database: "Structure d'Accueil de Donnees d'Etalonnage", a data repository built by "Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales" (CNES) for collecting and storing data acquired over various ground reference areas including desert reference sites. The recovered ground model was then transferred to the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and compared with an available Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) spectral measurement. The comparison shows good agreement on the spectral shape and a total bias of less than +/-3%. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Characterization of forest attributes at fine scales is necessary to manage terrestrial resources in a manner that replicates, as closely as possible, natural ecological conditions. In forested ecosystems, management decisions are driven by variables such as forest composition, forest structure (both vertical and horizontal), and other ancillary data (i.e., topography, soils, slope, aspect, and disturbance regime dynamics). Vertical forest structure is difficult to quantify and yet is an important component in the decision-making process. This study investigated the use of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data for classifying this attribute at landscape scales for inclusion into decision-support systems. Analysis of field-derived tree height variance demonstrated that this metric could distinguish between two classes of vertical forest structure. Analysis of LiDAR-derived tree height variance demonstrated that differences between single-story and multistory vertical structural classes could be detected. Landscape-scale classification of the two structure classes was 97% accurate. This study suggested that within forest types of the Intermountain West region of the United States, LiDAR-derived tree heights could be useful in the detection of differences in the continuous, nonthematic nature of vertical forest structure with acceptable accuracies.

AB Differential radar interferometry, using archived ERS data over the region of the Dead Sea Transform, allows to detect ground movement (subsidence or uplift) in playas within the southern Arava Valley segment of the Dead Sea Rift. These measurements are consistent with a mean displacement rate of about 0.4 cm/month, in the direction of the radar beam, during the 8-month period preceding the Nuweiba earthquake of 22 November 1995. In the 3 years following the earthquake, the measured rate was smaller by a factor of 10. These movements are not related to salt diapirs or water pumping activities in the area, The exact location, along faults, suggests a possible correlation with pre-seismic and post-seismic fault deformation.
   A simple fault model consistent with the observed phenomena associates the observed subsidence/uplift to right and left stepping enechelon fault patterns related to inter-seismic tensional accumulation along the faults. Further observations are necessary on this site and similar fault areas to corroborate the correlation between seismic activity and the observed phenomena. Monitoring of these sites should continue with differential Global positioning system (GPS) measurements and radar interferometric analysis using Envisat and Radarsat as well as archived data (including J-ERS).

DE false alarm rate; fire index; forest fire surveillance systems
AB One of the main problems related to infrared remote sensing of forest fires by automatic systems concerns the rejection of false alarms. The study of the infrared spectral radiance emitted by a biomass fire has been used to define spectral algorithms that permit to separate fires from other sources considered as false alarms. The different behaviour of the medium (3-5 mum) and thermal (8-12 mum) infrared spectral regions has been the basis for the definition of a new "figure" of merit, the so-called Fire Index (FI). An experimental burn has been used to test the ability of FI to identify clearly fires. A second algorithm based on an intraband analysis, the Mid-IR Fire Index (MFI), has been proposed to give complementary information to FI. Evolution of FI and MFI values with distance for different IR sources has been calculated. Finally, an experimental validation of both algorithms has been performed by using two infrared cameras working in the medium and thermal infrared spectral windows. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB A method is developed to separate Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data into contributions from woody (perennial) and herbaceous (annual) vegetation, and thereby to infer their separate leaf area indices and cover fractions. The method is formally consistent with fundamental linearity requirements for such a decomposition, and is capable of rejecting contaminated NDVI data. In this study, estimates of annual averaged woody cover and monthly averaged herbaceous cover over Australia are determined using Pathfinder AVHRR Land series (PAL) Global Area Coverage (GAC) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI data from 1981 to 1994, together with ground-based measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and foliage projective cover (FPC).

AB Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) hyperspectral data is used to investigate the effects of topography on the selection of spectral end members, and to assess whether the topographic correction improves the discrimination of rock units for lithologic mapping. A publicly available Digital Elevation Model (DEM), at a scale of 1:50,000, is used to model the radiance variation of the scene as a function of topography, assuming a Lambertian surface. Skylight is estimated and removed from the airborne data using a dark object correction. The CASI data is corrected on a pixel-by-pixel basis to normalize the scene to a uniform solar illumination and viewing geometry. The results show that topography has the effect of expanding end member clusters at times resulting in the overlap of clusters and that the correction process can effectively reduce the variation in detected radiance due to changes in local illumination. When topographic effects are embedded in the hyperspectral data, methods typically used for the selection of end members, such as the convex hull method, can miss end members or result in the selection of nonrepresentative pixels as end members. Thus, end members selected by some conventional methods are very likely "incomplete" or "nonrepresentative" if the topographic effect is embedded in the data. As shown in this study, the topographic correction can reveal hidden end members and achieve a better representation of end members via the statistical center of isolated clusters.

AB We describe and validate an automated model that retrieves subpixel snow-covered area and effective grain size from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. The model analyzes multiple endmember spectral mixtures with a spectral library of snow, vegetation, rock, and soil. We derive snow spectral endmembers of varying grain size from a radiative transfer model; spectra for vegetation, rock, and soil were collected in the field and laboratory. For three AVIRIS images of Mammoth Mountain, California that span common snow conditions for winter through spring, we validate the estimates of snow-covered area with fine-resolution aerial photographs and validate the estimates of grain size with stereological analysis of snow samples collected within 2 It of the AVIRIS overpasses. The RMS error for snow-covered area retrieved from AVIRIS for the combined set of three images was 4%. The RMS error for snow grain size retrieved from a 3x3 window of AVIRIS data for the combined set of three images is 48 mum, and the RMS error for reflectance integrated over the solar spectrum and over all hemispherical reflectance angles is 0.018.

AB We evaluated the initial 12 months of vegetation index product availability from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Earth Observing System-Terra platform. Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the general methods and some preliminary results of validating Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface reflectance and albedo products using ground measurements and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. Since ground "point" measurements are not suitable for direct comparisons with MODIS pixels of about 1 km over heterogeneous landscapes, upscaling based on high-resolution remotely sensed imagery is critical. In this study, ground measurements at Beltsville, MD were used to calibrate land surface reflectance and albedo products derived from ETM+ imagery at 30 m, which were then aggregated to the MODIS resolution for determining the accuracy of the following land surface products: (1) bidirectional reflectance from atmospheric correction, (2) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), (3) broadband albedos, and (4) nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance. The initial validation results from ground measurements and two ETM+ images acquired on October 2 and November 3, 2000 showed that these products are reasonably accurate, with typically less than 5% absolute error. Final conclusions on their accuracy depend on more validation results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This is an introductory work that describes the manifestation of the island mass effect phenomena in the atmosphere and at the sea surface for a region of the ocean depleted from oceanographic work-the Madeira Archipelago (33degreesN, 17degreesW). The use of remote sensing tools becomes essential in recognizing some of the sea-surface features that characterize the island mass effect phenomena. AVHRR, coastal zone color scanner (CZCS), and SeaWiFS ancillary National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data. together with highly developed processing tools from PANORAMA (Processing and Automatic Navigation Of ReAl-time iMAges) allowed the detection of atmospheric Von Karman Vortex Streets. warm water surface wakes, leeward eddies, Azorean front. and localized upwelling. Results from the remote sensing analysis also helped to promote the reanalysis of historical in situ data for the manifestation of these island effects. IPIMAR cruises carried Out between 1979 and 1982 collected temperature, salinity. density. and chlorophyll data, which A ere reinterpolated at the sea surface to study the island mass effect phenomena for the first time. Results have shown the formation of a warm water wake south of Madeira Island expanding 400 km offshore. The surface signature of the Azorean front. the so-called subtropical front, seems to take place within the Madeira latitude (33degreesN). North waters were consistently colder than the Warm and salty southern waters. AVHRR data also revealed eddies and fronts being formed in the region. Leeward eddies were often observed in the flanks of the islands: CZCS data showed highly productive eddies in the west of Madeira Island. Localized cold water with high chlorophyll concentrations x as also observed around the island's coast. A particularly dynamic area was the underwater ridge that connected Madeira and Desertas Islands. Future work should continue to sample these regions of interest with the simultaneous use of different satellite sensors. Vertical characterization of the different phenomena is needed.

AB The usability of altimeter sea level data (TOPEX/POSEIDON) and scatterometer wind data (QuikSCAT) in El Nino and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) prediction is investigated with the latest version of the Lamont forecast model. The emphasis of this study is on the effectiveness of these data sets in initializing the model to forecast the 1999-2000 La Nina conditions. Both the altimeter and scatterometer observations helped to improve the model, with the former being more effective for this period. It is possible and extremely useful to apply these data to real-time ENSO forecasting. In principle, it is advisable to assimilate multiple data sets so that they can complement one another in providing the correct initial conditions for the model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

ID FLUORESCENCE; TEMPERATURE; LIDAR; FORM
AB This paper describes laser-induced fluorescence and Raman signal measurements from coastal waters. These measurements collect laser-induced signals as a function of laser wavelengths and water temperatures. For each laser wavelength, the laser energies simultaneously induce dissolved organic material (DOM) fluorescence, alga fluorescence, and Raman signals. For the water samples used, these measurements show that DOM and Raman signal amplitudes are insensitive to water temperatures. However, alga fluorescence signals increases slowly with increases in water temperatures. The wavelength-dependent measurements show that Raman signal amplitudes decrease with increases in excitation laser wavelengths between 490 and 535 nm, the wavelength range used in these measurements. The alga fluorescence signal amplitudes also decrease with increase in excitation laser wavelengths. However. these decreases are insignificant compared to that of Raman signals. Within the excitation laser wavelength range studied, the DOM fluorescence does not show significant spectral structures that depend on laser wavelengths. The measurement results suggest optimum laser wavelengths for studying laser-induced inelastic scattering in coastal waters. These data also suggest that for both active and passive coastal water remote sensing, Raman signals may bias alga fluorescence measurement results depending on relative alga fluorescence and Raman signal intensity.

DE phytoplankton seasonal cycle; physical environment
AB The patterns of seasonal variation of surface plant pigment concentration (Chl) in the Newfoundland region were studied using remotely sensed data from the coastal zone color scanner (CZCS) (1978-1986) and sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor (SeaWiFS) radiometers (from September 1997 to October 1999). Sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained from AVHRR radiometers and sea surface height (SSH) data obtained from TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter were then used to interpret the observed patterns in terms of physical factors which influence the growth of phytoplankton. Stable seasonal cycles of both SST and Chl were observed in all parts of the re ion under study (Labrador Current, Newfoundland Bank, Flemish Pass, frontal zone between Gulf Stream and Labrador Current). The SST. values in the summer season during the 2 years under study (September 1997-October 1999) wen up to 3 degreesC higher as compared to climatologically averaged values. The seasonal pattern of Chi in the Labrador Current (one was typical of Arctic regions lone maximum in summer); in the Gulf Stream zone, it was typical of subtropical regions (smoothed maximum during winter); and in bt tween these zones, the pattern was typical of mid-latitudes (two maxima: in spring and autumn). Over the Grand Newfoundland Bank, the seasonal pattern had one spring maximum, typical of shallow: regions. The patterns of seasonal phytoplankton cycles resulted mainly from the meteorological factors influencing water stratification; the latter. seems to be a crucial factor in either light or nutrient limitation of phytoplankton growth.

TI Quantitative improvement in the estimates of NDVI values from remotely
   sensed data by correcting thin cirrus scattering effects
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID MODIS; CLOUD; CHANNEL
AB The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been used extensively for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel at 0.66 mum and near-infrared channel at 0.86 mum. Thin cirrus clouds frequently contaminate remotely sensed data acquired from aircraft and satellite platforms. They introduce additional scattered radiances to the 0.66-mum and 0.86-mum channels. To obtain unbiased estimates of NDVI values from remotely sensed data, the cirrus scattering effects must be removed. We recently have developed an empirical technique for removing thin cirrus scattering effects using the sensitive 1.375-mum cirrus-detecting channel. In this article, we demonstrate that the estimates of NDVI values van be improved quantitatively after the removal of thin cirrus effects. Pairs of spectral imaging data, with and nearly without thin cirrus contamination, acquired with the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) are used in this study. Because a special channel centered at 1.375 mum has been implemented on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) for detecting thin cirrus clouds from space, it is possible to remove thin cirrus scattering effects from MODIS channels below 1 mum and to yield improved global estimates of NDVI values from MODIS data.

AB This study describes the use of ground-based albedometer measurements for validating albedo measurements acquired from space at the 1-km spatial resolution of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This work forms an element of the Grassland Prototype Validation Exercise initiative, a prelaunch Earth Observing System field experiment conducted in May 1997 at Jornada, NM, USA. In lieu of MODIS data, we present albedo comparisons using 1.1-km Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer and 6x7-km Polarisation and Directionality of the Earth's Radiation data. To derive broadband albedo from the satellite data, we calculate spectral albedo through the multiangular inversion of a semiempirical bidirectional reflectance distribution function model and perform narrowband-to-broadband albedo conversion using an observed spectrum as interpolator and extrapolator of spectral albedo. Comparisons of ground-based albedo values to the satellite-derived values meet the +/-0.05 suggested accuracy requirement for global climate modeling and are close to the +/-0.02 suggested standard. Spatial modeling based on assigning typical albedos to three land cover classes obtained through classification of 12-m resolution Thematic Mapper Simulater data over the 1.1X1.1-km area of an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer pixel shows that the instrument tower at the field site, in the vicinity of which the ground albedo measurements were made, was located in an area where the local spatial heterogeneity of albedo is similar to that at the coarser satellite resolution. This explains the agreement between the ground-based and the satellite-derived albedo values despite the difference in spatial scale. These results provide the first step in establishing appropriate strategies for albedo validation for MODIS. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

TI Utilizing multiple datasets for snow-cover mapping
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID MICROWAVE; VARIABILITY
AB Snow-cover maps generated from surface data are based on direct measurements. However, they are prone to interpolation errors where climate stations are sparsely distributed. Snow cover is clearly discernible using satellite-obtained optical data because of the high albedo of snow, yet the surface is often obscured by cloud cover. Satellite-obtained passive microwave data, compared with optical data, is relatively unaffected by clouds; however, the snow-cover signature is significantly affected by melting snow and the microwaves may be transparent to thin snow (<3 cm). Both optical and microwave sensors have problems discerning snow beneath forest canopies. This paper describes a method that combines ground and satellite-derived optical and passive microwave data to produce a multiple-dataset snow-cover product. Comparisons with current snow-cover products show that the multiple-dataset product draws together the advantages of each of its component products while minimizing the potential errors. Improved estimates of the snow-covered area are derived through the addition of two snow-cover classes ("thin or patchy" and "high elevation" snow cover) and from the analysis of the climate station data within each class. The compatibility of this method for use with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data, which will be available in 1999, and with Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer data, available in 2000, is also discussed. With the assimilation of these data, the resolution of the multiple-dataset product would be improved both spatially and temporally and the analysis would become completely automated.

AB The potential of using ERS Scatterometer data for soil moisture monitoring over the Ukraine is investigated. The ERS Scatterometer is a C-band radar with a spatial resolution of 50 km and a high temporal sampling rate. An algorithm for estimating the surface soil moisture content is applied to 6 years of data. A qualitative comparison with meteorological observations and auxiliary information indicates that good-quality surface wetness values can be determined. A simple method is developed to relate the surface estimates with die profile soil moisture content. This model requires as input the remotely sensed radar data and soil data encompassing wilting level, field capacity, and porosity. The method was validated with an extensive data set of gravimetric soil moisture measurements in the 0-20 cm and 0-100 cm layers from the agrometeorological network in the Ukraine. It is found that the ERS Scatterometer data can be used to distinguish about five soil moisture levels with good confidence. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

AB Monitoring od forest evolution and functioning with remote sensing depends on canopy BRF (bidirectional reflectance factor) sensitivity to biophysical parameters and to canopy PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) regime. Here, we study the canopy BRF of a tropical (Sumatra) and three boreal (Canada) forest sites, with the DART (discrete anisotropic radiative transfer) model. The behavior of PAR regime of these forests is analysed in a companion article. We assessed the BRF sensitivity to some major experimental parameters (scale of analysis, viewing and illumination directions, sky radiation) and compared it with BRF sensitivity to commonly studied biophysical quantities: Leaf area index (LAI) and leaf optical properties. Simulations show;ed that BRF directional anisotropy is very large for all forests. For example, maximum relative reflectance difference with view zenith angle less than 25 degrees is around 0.5 in the visible, 0.4 in the short wave infrared and 0.25 in the near-infrared for tropical forest. We showed that this BRF variability associated with experimental conditions can hamper the remote detection of forest LAI and tree cover change such as deforestation of tropical forest. DART BRFs of the boreal sites were favourably compared with ground (PARABOLA) and airborne (POLDER) measured BRFs, This work stressed 1) the potential of the DART model, 2) the importance of accurate field data for validation approaches, and 3) the very strong influence of canopy architecture on forest BRF; for example, depending on forest sites, a LAI increase may imply that nadir near-infrared reflectance increases or decreases.

AB Algorithms based on reflectance band ratios have been developed for the remote estimation of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophyll a+b, and total carotenoid content of Eucalyptus leaves. Reflectance spectra over the 400-2500 nm range with a spectral resolution of 2 nm and the content of chlorophylls a, b, a+b, and total carotenoids were determined for leaves from several Eucalyptus species covering a wide range of chlorophyll a content (0.0121-0.0435 mg/cm(2)). Maximum sensitivity of reflectance to variation in pigment content was found in the green wavelength region at 550 nn and at 708 nun in the far-red wavelengths. The reflectance in the main pigment absorption regions in the blue (400-500 nm) and red (660-690 nm) wavelengths proved to be insensitive to variation in pigment content. The ratio R672/(R550XR708) correlated best with chlorophyll a, chlorophyll a+b, and total carotenoid contents. The ratio R672/R550 correlated best with chlorophyll b content. Reflectance ratios involving near infrared bands such as R750/R550 and R750/R700 did not correlate well with pigment content. This was due to the differential scattering effects of the wide range of young and mature leaf samples. A method was developed for adjusting all spectra to the same level of scatter. The near-infrared-based reflectance ratios from the scatter adjusted spectra showed high sensitivity to pigment content. The ratio R860/(R550XR708) from the scatter adjusted spectra correlated best with chlorophyll a, chlorophyll a+b, and total carotenoid contents, while R860/R550 correlated best with chlorophyll b content. The newly developed algorithms were tested on a validation data set and allowed accurate estimates of leaf pigment content. The pigment contents estimated by the ratios from untransformed spectra, R672/(R550XR708) and R672/R550, were found to be not significantly different from the estimates obtained using the scatter-adjusted reflectance ratios, R860/(R550XR708) and R860/R550.

AB Two important parameters used for monitoring coastal water quality are the concentrations of chlorophyll and suspended sediment in surface waters. Ocean color remote sensing provides a convenient method of determining these concentrations from upwelling radiances. In the open ocean, it is not difficult to derive empirical algorithms relating the received radiances to surface concentrations of chlorophyll. In tur-bid coastal waters, however, this is much more difficult due to the presence of high concentrations of suspended sediments and dissolved organic material, which overwhelm the spectral signal of chlorophyll. Neural networks have been proven successful in modeling a variety of geophysical transfer functions. Here, a neural network is employed to model the transfer function between the chlorophyll and sediment concentrations and the satellite-received radiances. It was found that a neural network with two hidden nodes, using the three visible Landsat Thematic Mapper bands as inputs, was able to model the transfer function to a much higher accuracy than,multiple regression analysis. The RMS errors for the neural network were <10%, while the errors for regression analysis were >25%. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
AB AVIRIS data covering the Bodie and neighboring Paramount mining districts, eastern California, were used to map hydrothermal alteration minerals. Two spectral analysis algorithms were used: Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Tricorder. The objective was to compare the performance of the two algorithms where no a priori ground or atmospheric information is available. AVIRIS data were calibrated to apparent surface reflectance using a modified MODTRAN radiative transfer model in conjunction with laboratory and in-flight calibration data. Both algorithms appear to produce satisfactory results for geologic reconnaissance and mapping applications, but Tricorder generally classified more pixels and identified more mineral species than SAM. For some minerals, such as Na-montmorillonite, results from Tricorder and SAM matched reasonably well, but major differences appeared in how to two algorithms classified kaolinite group minerals and ferric oxides. Laboratory spectra of rock samples from five localities were compared to reference spectra of minerals identified by the classification algorithms for corresponding pixels, with the results matching to some extent.

AB The surface temperature of the polar regions controls sea ice growth, snow melt, and surface-atmosphere energy exchange. However, our limited knowledge of polar surfaces and atmospheres has hampered the development of methods to estimate surface temperature with satellite data. In this article, clear-sky surface-temperature retrieval algorithms for use with the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) for the Arctic and the Antarctic, over ocean and land, are presented. The methods are similar to those used in estimating sea and land surface temperatures but are developed with data specific to the polar regions. An extensive validation analysis using an annual cycle of surface measurements gives accuracies in the range of 0.3-2.1 K, the larger errors being attributable to the spatially variable surface of the validation area. For homogeneous surfaces the expected accuracy is sufficient for many climate process studies. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB We present an operational two-source (soil+vegetation) model for evaluating the surface energy balance given measurements of the time rate of change in radiometric surface temperature (T-RAD) during the morning hours. This model consists of a two-source surface component describing the relation between T-RAD and sensible heat flux, coupled with a time-integrated component connecting surface sensible heating with planetary boundary layer development. By tying together the time-dependent behavior of surface temperature and the temperature in the boundary layer with the flux of sensible heat from the surface to the atmosphere, the need for ancillary measurements of near-surface air temperature is eliminated. This is a significant benefit when T-RAD is acquired remotely. Air temperature can be strongly coupled to local biophysical surface conditions and, if the surface air and brightness temperature measurements used by a model are not collocated, energy flux estimates can be significantly corrupted. Furthermore, because this model uses only temporal changes in radiometric temperatures rather than absolute temperatures, time-independent biases in T-RAD, resulting from atmospheric effects or other sources, do not affect the estimated fluxes; only the time-varying component of corrections need be computed. The algorithm also decomposes the surface radiometric temperature into its soil and vegetation contributions; thus the angular dependence of T-RAD can be predicted from an observation of T-RAD at a single view angle. This capability is critical to an accurate interpretation of off-nadir measurements from polar orbiting and geosynchronous satellites. The performance of this model has been evaluated in comparison with data collected during two large-scale field experiments: the first International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project field experiment, conducted in and around the Konza Prairie in Kansas, and the Monsoon '90 experiment, conducted in the semiarid rangelands of the Walnut Gulch Watershed in southern Arizona. Both comparisons yielded uncertainties comparable to those achieved by models that do require air temperature as an input and to measurement errors typical of standard micrometeorological methods for flux estimation. A strategy for applying the two-source time-integrated model on a regional or continental scale is briefly outlined. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID INTERFEROMETRY
AB Thr Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-band synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), the most advanced imaging radar system to have flown in Earth orbit, was carried in the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle Endeavour in April and October 1994. SIR-C/X-SAR simultaneously recorded data at three wavelengths (L-, C-, and X-bands; 23.5 cm, 5.8 cm, and 3.1 cm, respectively). In addition, the full polarimetric scattering matric was obtained at L- and C-band over a variety of terrain and vegetation types. Scientists are using multifrequency, polarimetric SIR-C/X-SAR data in studies of geology, hydrology, ecology, oceanography, and radar remote sensing techniques. The October SIR-C/X-SAR flight also included acquisition of experimental repeat-pass interferometry data which have been used to generate digital elevation models els and to detect surface motions in volcanic, tectonic, and glacial terrains. Results from SIR-C/X-SAR clearly show the increased value of using multiparameter and interferometric capabilities to characterize Earth's surface and vegetation cover and to generate geophysical products compared with optical sensors or single-channel radars alone.

AB The spaceborne imaging radar-C, X-band synthetic aperture radar observations of rain storms are the first multipolarization and multifrequency observations of precipitation from space. In addition to numerous, often dramatic images of severe weather systems obtained by forming a synthetic aperture in the usual side-looking attitude, several data takes were performed while the radar antennas were parallel to the ground and the radar beams were pointing at nadir. These opportunities coincided with the passage of the Shuttle over Tropical Cyclone Odille in the southern Indian Ocean during the first flight and over Typhoon Seth in the western Pacific during the second flight. The resulting observations, or more appropriately, the resulting measurements, demonstrate for the first time the capability of a spaceborne multifrequency multipolarization microwave radar system to quantify precipitation rates, to detect hydrometeor phase, and to classify rain type.

DT Article
AB In this article, the relationship between secondary forest regrowth stage and SIR-C SAR data is assessed for an area located near to the Tapajo's National Forest, south of Para State, in the Amazon region. These regeneration stages are mapped by making use of a consecutive annual sequence of Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) images. Using this map as a mask over the radar images, the tonal means (expressed in dB) and coefficient of variation (CV) for several second-growth succession stages classes are calculated. It is shown that the discrimination between regeneration stages is difficult when individual ''small areas are used, but this discrimination might be possible when L-band means over a ''large area are computed. In particular, the L-HV band seems to carry more information. The maximum difference of means among classes occurred in this band and it is of about 5 dB. The CV appeared to be less well suited than the mean value for regeneration stage discrimination, although some discrimination among early stages of regeneration may be possible using this measure at L-band.

ID REFLECTANCE; RANGELANDS
AB Color is a key feature used in the identification and classification of soils. Soil reflectance has a direct relationship with soil color, as well as to other parameters such as texture, soil moisture, and organic matter. Earlier studies have quantified the relationship between reflectance and soil color using simple linear regression equations having correlation coefficients of about 0.5. In the present study, a method called optimal rotational transformation technique has been employed to maximize the correlation between soil color and transformed reflectance. Seventy-six soil samples having a wide range of soil color were employed in the laboratory measurements. Multispectral reflectances were measured using an Exotech radiometer in the visible and near-infrared bands of the Landsat MSS sensor, and soil color was measured using the Munsell color charts. The soil color data were quantified using the RGB color coordinate system since colors recorded in the Munsell system are not readily usable in numerical analysis. Simple linear regression models using the raw reflectance data yielded correlations of about 0.5. Optimal rotational transformation of the reflectance data and multiple linear regressions showed an improved correlation of r more than 0.8, and the models predicted the main color component (viz. hue) with acceptable accuracy. Hue images can be used for identification and discrimination of soils and lithological formations, since hue is independent of illumination and therefore capable of suppressing shadows. Optimal models can be developed to predict soil reflectance using color data since metamerism is rarely observed in the care of soils. Results of this study have a potential application for identification and mapping of soil and geologic materials of nonvegetated or sparsely vegetated regions using data received from airborne and space-borne remote sensors operating in the visible and near-infrared bands.

AB Desert areas are good candidates for the assessment of multitemporal, multiband, or multiangular calibration of optical satellite sensors. This article describes a selection procedure of desert sites in North Africa and Saudi Arabia, of size 100 x 100 km(2), using a criterion of spatial uniformity in a series of Meteosat-4 visible data. Twenty such sites are selected with a spatial uniformity better than 3% in relative value in a multitemporal series of cloud-free images. These sites are among the driest sites in the world. Their meteorological properties are here described in terms of cloud cover with ISCCP data and precipitation using data from a network of meteorological stations. Most of the selected sites are large sand seas, the geomorphology of which can be characterized with Spot data. The temporal stability of the spatially averaged reflectance of each selected site is investigated at seasonal and hourly time scales with multitemporal series of Metcosat-4 data. It is found that the temporal variations, of typical peak-to-peak amplitude 8-15% in relative value, are mostly controlled by directional effects. Once the directional effects are removed, the residual rms variations, representative of random temporal variability, are on the order of 1-2% in relative value. The suitability of use of these selected sites in routine operational calibration procedures is briefly discussed.

ID SIGNATURES
AB Complex dielectric constants determined by inversion of the polarized returns of AIRSAR images acquired in wet conditions delineate the distribution of saline soils in irrigated regions around the town of Pyramid Hill, in western Victoria, Australia. There is good agreement between the areas delineated as having anomalous dielectric constants by the radar backscatter inversion techniques with saline areas as defined by electrical conductivity and as inferred from dielectric constants determined in the field. Surface roughness maps and vegetation classification maps derived from AIRSAR data provide useful ancillary information regarding the extent of salinity in the region, but they are not as diagnostic as the determined dielectric constants. The magnitudes of P band radar-determined dielectric constants most closely approach those expected from field determinations, although the distribution of L-band-determined dielectric constants gives the best discrimination between saline and nonsaline areas as seen at the surface. C-band-determined dielectric constants are much lower than expected from field determinations and show saline areas as anomalous only in the bare, most severely affected, areas. The more general regional distribution of high dielectric areas seen at P band may be a more accurate indication of the salinity at. depth. The AIRSAR image inversion techniques generally underestimate the magnitude of the complex dielectric constant. AIRSAR data for salinity mapping should be acquired under wet conditions. In such conditions there is an electrical continuum between the wet ground surface and saline water within the pores in the upper soil horizons. A wet ground surface results in a higher total power return than that which would occur under dry conditions and in a higher contrast between the radar-dark and radar bright areas within the scene.

AB The variogram analysis of different reference image facies on a SPOT-XS scene enables the definition of a discriminant texture index. The values of this index are extracted locally in a given neighborhood. This textural information is matched with the multispectral information in order to realize a combined classification. The result is subsequently compared to a digitized geological map, in order to extract zones of anomaly, regarded as the difference between the combined classification and the geological map. A majority of the anomalies require further interpretation, while certain others are interesting to mineral prospecting.

TI Extracting forest age in a Pacific Northwest Forest from thematic mapper

ID NEURAL NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; MODEL
AB The feasibility of extracting forest age of young stands (< 50 yr) in a Pacific Northwest Forest using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) spectral bands and topographic information was explored using a neural network approach. Understanding the changes of forest fragmentation through time are important for assessing alterations in ecosystem processes (forest productivity, species diversity, nutrient cycling, carbon flux, hydrology, spread of pests, etc.) and wildlife habitat and populations. The study area teas the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest on the Blue River Ranger District of the Willamette National Forest in western Oregon. Timber harvesting has occurred in this forest over the past 45 years and has a recorded forest management history. The study area was extracted from a georeferenced TM scene acquired on 7 July 1991. A coincident digital terrain model (DTM) derived from digital topographic elevation data was also acquired. Using this DTM and an image processing software package, slope and aspect images were generated over the study area. Sites were chosen to cover the entire range of forest stand age and slope and aspect. The oldest recorded clearcut stands were logged in 1950. A number of sites were chosen as primary forest which had no recorded history of cutting. Various feed-forward neural networks trained with back propagation were tested to predict forest age from TM data and topographic data. The results demonstrated that neural networks can be used as an initial model for inferring forest age. The best network was a 6-->5-->1 structure with inputs of TM Bands 3, 4, and 5, elevation, slope and aspect. The rms values of the predicted forest age were on the order of 5 years. TM Bands 1, 2, 6, and 7 did not significantly add information to the network for learning forest age. Furthermore, the results suggest that topographic information (elevation, slope, and aspect) can be effectively utilized by a neural network approach. The results of the network approach were significantly better than corresponding linear systems.

AB Litter is frequently present within vegetation canopies and thus contributes to the overall spectral response of a canopy. Consequently, litter will affect spectral indices designed to be sensitive to green vegetation, soil brightness or other features. The main objectives of the current research were to 1) evaluate the spectral properties of green vegetation and litter and 2) quantify the effect of standing litter on the performance of spectral indices. The SAIL (scattering by arbitrarily inclined leaves) model teas used to generate canopy reflectance ''mixtures'' and to estimate fractions of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) with varying leaf area index (LAI), soil background, combinations of vegetation, component spectral properties, and one or two horizontal vegetation layers. Spectral measurements of different bare soils and mature green and senescent leaves of representative plant species at the HAPEX-Sahel (Hydrological Atmospheric Pilot Experiment) study sites were used as input. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and the modified NDVI (MNDVI) and mixture model spectral indices were selected to evaluate their performance with respect to standing litter and green vegetation mixtures. Spectral reflectance signatures of leaf litter varied significantly, but strongly resembled soil spectral characteristics. The biophysical parameters (LAI, fAPAR), derived from spectral vegetation indices, tended to be overestimated for randomly distributed, sparse green and fitter vegetation cover mixtures, and underestimated for randomly distributed dense green and litter vegetation cover mixtures. All spectral indices and their biophysical interpretation were significantly altered by variability in 1) green leaf, leaf litter, and bark optical properties, 2) the amount and position of standing leaf litter, 3) leaf angle distribution, and 4) soil background. The NDVI response to these variables was inconsistent, and was the most affected by litter. The spectral mixture model indices, designed to be sensitive to litter were shown to be promising for the identification of litter present among different ecosystems.

ID HIGH-RESOLUTION RADIOMETER; VAPOR
AB The effect emissivity on the relations between the NOAA-9 AVHRR infrared split window temperature difference (Delta T = difference of brightness of temperatures for 10.1-11.5 mu m and 11.2-12.6 Delta m bands) and atmospheric precipitable water (W), namely, Delta T = alpha + beta W and W = alpha' + beta' Delta T, is quantified in terms of red reflectance (0.55-0.72 mu m) observed by the AVHRR. Two years (1987 and 1988) of AVHRR and radiosonde observations at 44 globally distributed land surface locations have been used in the analysis. Predictions of a radiative transfer model are tested using these observations, which indicate possible discrepancies between the predicted and the observed results. Estimates of 10.1-11.5 mu m band emissivity have been made by interpreting the intercept of Delta T-W regression according to the theoretical predictions, and these emissivities were found to be linearly related to the red reflectance. Precipitable water estimated from the observed Delta T and red reflectance (by the AVHRR) for the two years at 11 locations over South America and Europe when compared with the observed precipitable water (from radiosonde) gave a mean absolute error of 5 mm and a bias of 4 mm, with the explained variance of 79%. Some inherent uncertainties in the data used in the present analysis have been noted.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
AB This article describes a multispectral digital video imaging system for remote sensing research. The system is comprised of three charge coupled device (CCD) analog video cameras, a computer equipped with an image digitizing board, a color encoder, and super (S)-VHS portable recorder. The cameras are visible/near-infrared (NIR) (0.4-1.1 mu m) light sensitive. Two of the cameras are equipped with visible yellow-green (YG, 0.555-0.565 mu m) and red (R, 0.625-0.635 mu m) filters, respectively, while the third camera has a NIR (0.845-0.857 mu m) filter. The computer is a 486-DX50 system that has an RCB image grabbing board (640 x 480 pixel resolution). The NIR, R, and YG image signals from the cameras are subjected to RGB inputs of the computer digitizing board, thus giving a color-infrared (CIR) composite digital image similar in color tonal rendition to that of CIR film. The hard disk can store 1000 CIR composite images. In addition, the cameras' signals are also subjected to a color encoder that provides an analog CIR composite which is stored on the S-VHS recorder. The analog CIR imagery recording serves as a back-up in the event the computer malfunctions. A global positioning system (GPS) is also integrated with the imagery. The system provides high quality digital video imagery that is superior in resolution to analog video imagery. Image examples are given demonstrating its application to natural resource assessment.

AB Current satellite algorithms to estimate photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at the Earth's surface are reviewed, and selected results are presented. PAR can be obtained directly from top-of-atmosphere solar radiance, which is used to determine the transmissivity of the atmosphere. Since clouds do not absorb significantly at PAR wavelengths, the radiative transfer modeling is generally simplified compared to that for total insolation. The accuracies reported, about 10% and 6% on daily and monthly time scales, respectively, are useful for modeling oceanic and terrestrial primary productivity. The large short-term variability in the ratio of PAR and insolation, essentially due to clouds, is reduced at those time scales, suggesting that reasonably accurate PAR climatologies may be obtained from available insolation climatologies (satellite or other).

AB The carbon rand nitrogen cycles are crucial for understanding the changing Earth system, influencing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, primary productivity of the biosphere, and biogenic emissions of reactive trace species. The carbon budget of the terrestrial biosphere has attracted special attention because of its role in atmospheric changes in carbon dioxide. The terrestrial biosphere influences atmospheric CO2 through three main modes: First, large, nearly balanced fluxes of CO2 in photosynthesis and respiration exhibit a degree of interannual variability which can influence atmospheric CO2, at feast on annual to decadal time scales. Second, land use changes release CO2 to the atmosphere. Third, poorly understood processes are likely resulting in enhanced uptake of CO2 in certain ecosystems, acting as a sink in the global carbon cycle. This sink may result from forest demographics, atmospheric N deposition, or direct CO2 fertilizatian, or some synergistic combination of those processes. Global estimates of terrestrial carbon cycle components requires the use of remote observations; however, the appropriate remote sensing strategies are quite different for the various components.

AB The coregionalization of radiation sensed by an airborne multispectral scanner (MSS) and both the green leaf area index (GLAI) of barley and the biomass of pasture has been investigated and modeled. In both crops there was fairly strong spatial interdependence with the radiation, even though the simple correlation was weak. The auto and cross variograms showed dependence extending to some 15 m. These functions were used with the data to estimate GLAI and biomass by cokriging, and to calculate the estimation variances. The results showed that whereas simple regression would have provided worthless estimates, cokriging with the MSS data both increased the precision of the estimates above that attainable by auto kriging, and allowed the planning of a new survey with substantially less sampling effort. The study also revealed considerable redundancy in the MSS data.

AB This study examines the variability of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over Bostwana during the period 1982-1987. Its relationship to rainfall is evaluated from 26 stations representing six vegetation formations and sir soil types. The study demonstrates a linear relationship between rainfall and NDVI as long as rainfall does not exceed approximately 500 mm/yr or 50-100 mm/month. Above these limits, a ''saturation'' response occurs and NDVI increases with rainfall only very slowly. This occurs at much lower thresholds of rainfall over Bostwana than over East Africa or the Sahel. The ratio of NDVI to rainfall in Botswana is several times higher than in savannas in these other two regions. Both this ratio, which represents the rain-use efficiency, and the total productivity of vegetation, as assessed from NDVI, vary with vegetation and soil type. The highest productivity and efficiency occur on the clay-rich vertisols, the lowest on the sandy arenosols and solonchaks. In general, the drain-use efficiency appears to be more a function of the underlying soil than of the vegetation formation.

AB A semiempirical model is developed to represent the seasonal profile of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over temperate agricultural regions observed by NOAA/AVHRR local area coverage measurements where, due to 1.1 km resolution, pixels are mixtures of agricultural crop fields. However, crops with similar phenology behave radiatively as optically homogeneous canopies. In such cases, a logistic function using five parameters describes the annual time profile of the NDVI. Two of the five parameters are the ascending and descending inflection points, which convey important information about the development of the crop.  Over a region like Beauce (approximately 10,000 km2), the relative area and phenology of the crops grown results in two time profiles, one for winter crops and one for summer crops. Consequently, two logistic functions were combined to describe the variations of the NDVI derived from NOAA /AVHRR data.  The equations are fitted using a nonlinear least squares procedure against data sets that included hand-held radiometer measurements in fields of the individual crops, and two kinds of AVHRR data: actual data and synthetic data contaminated by artificial noise. The use of synthetic data indicates that the inflection points are retrieved with good accuracy, even with noise. When the inversion scheme is applied to actual AVHRR data, it appears that a priori knowledge about the asymptotic values reached by the NDVI of the various crops is required in order to correctly estimate the dates of the inflection points, and then to obtain some useful information about the development of the crops.

TI A MODIFIED SOIL ADJUSTED VEGETATION INDEX
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB There is currently a great deal of interest in the quantitative characterization of temporal and spatial vegetation patterns with remotely sensed data for the study of earth system science and global change. Spectral models and indices are being developed to improve vegetation sensitivity by accounting for atmosphere and soil effects. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) was developed to minimize soil influences on canopy spectra by incorporating a soil adjustment factor L into the denominator of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) equation. For optimal adjustment of the soil effect, however, the L factor should vary inversely with the amount of vegetation present. A modified SAVI (MSAVI) that replaces the constant L in the SAVI equation with a variable L function is presented in this article. The L function may be derived by induction or by using the product of the NDVI and weighted difference vegetation index (WDVI). Results based on ground and aircraft-measured cotton canopies are presented. The MSAVI is shown to increase the dynamic range of the vegetation signal while further minimizing the soil background influences, resulting in greater vegetation sensitivity as defined by a ''vegetation signal'' to ''soil noise'' ratio.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess the magnitude of bidirectional reflectance distribution (BRD) effects in AVHRR Channels 1 and 2 over land, their dependence on land cover, and the possibility of correcting for these effects as part of the AVHRR compositing process. The study was carried out in central Canada using cloud-free full (1 km) resolution AVHRR images over 20 days near the peak green period in 1988. All images were coregistered and resampled. Uniform sample sites representing cropland, deciduous and coniferous forest, and wetlands were chosen using Landsat images. The effect of atmospheric corrections and the performance of three vegetation indices were also assessed. The results showed that BRD effects in the AVHRR data depend on land cover type, spectral band, the viewing geometry, and the degree of atmospheric correction. Atmospheric corrections increased the value of NDVI but reduced its variation with satellite zenith angle. BRD dependence in AVHRR Channels 1 and 2 could be modeled quite accurately, but spectral band- and land cover-specific model parameters were required for a good fit with the measurements. it is concluded that in AVHRR compositing based on the maximum NDVI value, the most-cloud-free pixel selection should precede atmospheric corrections and the correction for BRD effects. BRD correction models should be derived using data with similar spectral and spatial characteristics, preferably from the same sensor.

AB Since microwave remote sensing techniques are insensitive to cloud cover, they can, overcome this strong limitation, of optical remote sensing. As in the optical domain, their use for monitoring vegetation canopies requires the development of suitable inversion algorithms. These would allow the estimation of variables such as LAI from radar data. This article investigates the possible use of a semiempirical water-cloud model in an inversion scheme. Using radar data obtained with a ground-based dual-frequency (C and X bands, 5.7 and 3.3 cm wavelength, respectively) scatterometer on, experimental winter wheat fields, it is first verified that a semiempirical water-cloud model can adequately simulate the backscattering coefficients obtained over the growing season, as a function of LAI and surface soil moisture. Then it is shown that the model can be numerically inverted. This yields simultaneous estimation of LAI and surface soil moisture, the standard deviations of the residuals being respectively 0.64 m(2) m(-2) and 0.065 cm(3) cm(-3). Finally, the influence of radar measurement errors on the inversion scheme is quantified by means of a simulation study. This shows that a 1 dB accuracy of the radar is required for a 1 m(2) m(-2) precision, of the estimated LAI.

ID TIME DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY; SURFACE SOIL-MOISTURE
AB The NASA C-130 remote sensing aircraft was in Toulouse, France from 25 May through 4 July 1986, for participation in the HAPEX-MOBILHY program. Spectral and radiometric data were collected by C-130-borne sensors in the visible, infrared, and microwave wavelengths. These data provided information on the spatial and temporal variations Of surface parameters such as vegetation indices, surface temperature, and surface soil moisture. The Pushbroom Microwave Radiometer (PBMR) was used to collect passive microwave brightness temperature data. This four-beam sensor operates at the 21 -cm wavelength, providing cross-track coverage approximately 1.2 times the aircraft altitude, Observed brightness temperatures for the period were high, ranging from above 240 K to about 290 K. Brightness temperature images appeared to correspond well to spatial and temporal soil moisture variation. Previous research has demonstrated that an approximately linear relationship exists between the surface emissivity and surface soil moisture. For these data, however, regression analysis did not indicate a strong linear relationship (r2 = 0. 32 and r2 = 0. 42, respectively) because of the limited range of soil moisture conditions encountered and the small number of ground measurements. When results from wetter soil conditions encountered in another experiment were included, the regression improved dramatically. Based on similar research with the PBMR and an understanding of the ground data collection program, this result was examined to produce recommendations for improvements to future passive microwave research and data collection programs. Examples Of surface soil moisture maps generated with PBMR data are presented which appear to be representative of the actual soil moisture conditions.

TI A STUDY OF THE THERMAL BAR IN LAKE LADOGA USING WATER-SURFACE
   TEMPERATURE DATA FROM SATELLITE IMAGES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB During spring and autumn a special thermohydrodynamic phenomenon, called a thermal bar, can be observed in dimictic lakes. [A dimictic lake is a lake where a complete turnover of the water occurs twice a year (in spring and autumn).] The thermal bar is a zone of mixing that separates waters with temperatures above and below 4-degrees-C. Its practical importance is due to the possibility that it might isolate the nearshore region from the offshore region (as seen from the thermal bar), which may cause a serious pollution problem along the beach. This article presents a study of the thermal bar and its temporal behavior in Lake Ladoga, Russia, using NOAA-AVHRR CH4/CH5 data. As the thermal bar is associated with a rather characteristic temperature pattern, that is, relatively large temperature changes from the shore to the bar and weak gradients beyond implying almost isothermal conditions, satellite data can provide a good means of detecting the existence of a thermal bar. The satellite-derived water surface temperature distributions, calibrated with some in situ temperature data, show that the thermal bar progresses from the shallow southern region to the deep northern part of the lake. The thermal bar progression during spring, obtained from sequences of satellite images, is also compared with predictions from a simple theoretical model. The model assumes that the heat entering through the surface of a water column remains within the column (i.e., horizontal heat fluxes are neglected) and that complete vertical mixing takes place by convective water movements. The comparison shows a good agreement between satellite-derived an model-predicted thermal bar locations (although there are uncertainties as to certain inputs to the model). This indicates that advective and diffusive horizontal heat fluxes are not of primary importance for the thermal bar displacement and that the model is a good first approximation for predictions of the thermal bar location.

ID INSTRUMENT
AB A program was developed to learn class descriptions from positive and negative training examples of spectral reflectance data of bare soils. The program combined a form of learning referred to as ''learning by example'' with the generate-and-test paradigm to provide a robust learning environment that could handle error prone data. The program was tested by hating it learn class descriptions of various categories of organic carbon content, iron oxide content, and particle size distribution in soils. These class descriptions were then used to classify an array of targets. The class descriptions in this program were comprised of a series of different relationships (greater-than, first-maximum, second-maximum, first-minimum, second-minimum, convex, and concave) between combinations of spectral bands. The program found the sequence of relationships between bands that contained the most important information to distinguish the classes. The concept being learned was a sequence of relationships that optimized the discrimination of a class. Training examples of spectral reflectance data of bare soils were taken from data of Stoner and Baumgardner (1981). Classes of any soil characteristic that is in the data base can be explored. The characteristics include organic carbon content, iron oxide content, particle size distribution, soil order, mineralogy, cation exchange capacity, drainage class, and Munsell color. Combinations of the first four characteristics were used to make class descriptions that were used to classify the soil samples into the five classes observed by Stoner and Baumgardner (1981). Other classes of organic carbon, iron oxide, drainage, and clay content were explored using this method. The program was tested by learning class descriptions of these classes and subsequently classifying an array of unknown soil data. The results showed a high classification accuracy of 77 % for separating classes of high and low organic carbon content. Physical explanations for the class descriptions obtained were presented.

AB SOILSPECT is a radiative transfer model, derived from Hapke's model, that represents the optical properties of soil from 450 nm to 2450 nm. The spectral and bidirectional reflectance of 26 soils was measured in the laboratory both with a field spectroradiometer (1000 narrow wavebands from 450 nm to 2450 nm) and a radiometer simulating TM channels (the five TM2, TM3, TM4, TM5, and TM7 broad bands). The input parameters of the model [single scattering albedo-omega, phase function P(g,g'), and variable characteristic of the soil roughness h] were fitted to these observations. We show that the single scattering albedo is only dependent on wavelength and on soil humidity; the other parameters depend mainly on surface conditions.

DT Article
ID AVHRR DATA
AB At the present moment, land surface temperature cannot be obtained in a routine way from satellite data due, in part, to the nonexistence of a complete theoretical model that permits us to know the physical significance of land surface temperature obtained by remote sensors.  In this article a relationship between the effective temperature of the radiative system vegetation-ground and the temperatures of each part of the system (top, sunny and shaded wall of vegetation, and sunny and shaded soil) has been derived.  It depends on the proportions of each component observed by the sensor, on the ground and vegetation emissivities, and on the crop structure (mean height, width, and spacing).  The model was validated in an orange grove at Valencia during October 1990 and a standard error of estimate about 1-degrees-C was obtained.  A manual scanning system for measuring the effective temperature and a emissivity box for determining ground and vegetation emissivities were designed.  Measurements were made in the 8-14-mu-m waveband.  Assuming a priori knowledge of the crop structure and ground and vegetation emissivities, inversion strategies have been suggested for evaluating component temperatures from remote sensing measurements.

AB Between 11 and 19 March 1988, airborne and satellite passive microwave measurements were acquired simultaneously with ground measurements of depth, density and stratigraphy of the snow in central and northern Alaska. Five aircraft flights were flown along a north-south transect between about 147-degrees-W and 152-degrees-W, and extending from about 63-degrees-N (south of Fairbanks, Alaska) to the Arctic Ocean coastline, with an Aircraft Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (AMMR) on-board operating at 92 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, and 18 GHz. Passive microwave data from the satellite-borne Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSMI), operating at 85.5 GHz, 37 GHz, 21 GHz, 18 GHz, and 10 GHz, were obtained concurrently. A good correspondence in brightness temperature (T(B)) trends between the aircraft and satellite data was found. However, an expected inverse correlation between depth hoar thickness and T(B) was not found to be strong. A persistent T(B) minimum in both the aircraft and the satellite data was detected along the northern foothills of the Brooks Range. In an area located at about 68-degrees-50'N, 149-degrees-20'W, the T(B) as recorded from the aircraft microwave sensor dropped by 55 K Satellite microwave measurements showed a T(B) decrease of up to 45 K at approximately the same location. Snow pit measurements did not reveal notable differences in snow characteristics or depth in this location. examination of passive microwave satellite data from 1978 to 1987 revealed that similar low late-winter T(B) values were found in approximately the same locations as those observed in March 1988. According to the satellite data, the zone of low T(B) develops as the snow deepens, and reaches the lowest values in March or April each year. The cause of this T(B) minimum is unknown but thought to be related to snow stratigraphy. The observed difficulty in relating the ground measurements to data collected using aircraft and satellite passive microwave sensors is attributed to the fact that the snow depth and character are highly variable in central and northern Alaska. This variability is exemplified in the field measurements as well as in the passive microwave measurements.

TI ESTIMATION OF SHORTWAVE HEMISPHERICAL REFLECTANCE (ALBEDO) FROM
   BIDIRECTIONALLY REFLECTED RADIANCE DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SURFACES; CANOPIES; NADIR
AB Albedo is the ratio of reflected solar radiation from a surface to that incident upon it.  Due to the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite remote sensing instruments, many formulations have been developed to convert remotely sensed data into estimates of albedo.  Most of these equations depend upon the assumption of isotropic reflection and, therefore, use only nadir measurements; only in recent years have investigators attempted to model the anisotropic nature of terrestrial surfaces.  A Barnes Modular Multiband Radiometer (MMR) was used to collect remotely sensed data from prairie vegetation at seven view zenith angles in the solar principal plane.  An equation to estimate albedo from bidirectional reflectance data is proposed and evaluated in this paper.  The estimates of albedo were greater than values obtained with simultaneous pyranometer measurements:  a more conventional approach.  The overestimation was systematic.  Potential sources of error are discussed and include:  1) extrapolation of the bidirectional reflectance data out to a view zenith angle of 90-degrees; 2) use of inappropriate weighting coefficients in the numerator of the albedo equation; 3) surface shadowing caused by the A-frame instrumentation used to measure the incoming and outgoing radiation fluxes; 4) errors in estimates of the denominator of the proposed albedo equation (i.e., incoming shortwave radiation); and 5) a "hot spot" contribution in bidirectional data measured by the MMR.

AB This paper reviews the necessary considerations and available techniques for assessing the accuracy of remotely sensed data.  Included in this review are the classification system, the sampling scheme, the sample size, spatial autocorrelation, and the assessment techniques.  All analysis is based on the use of an error matrix or contingency table.  Example matrices and results of the analysis are presented.  Future trends including the need for assessment of other spatial data are also discussed.

TI MICROWAVE EMISSION AND CROP RESIDUES

DT Article
ID SOIL-MOISTURE
AB A series of controlled experiments were conducted to determine the significance of crop residues or stubble in estimating the emission of the underlying soil.  Observations using truck-mounted L and C band passive microwave radiometers showed that for dry wheat and soybeans the dry residue caused negligible attenuation of the background emission.  Green residues, with water contents typical of standing crops, did have a significant effect on the background emission.  Results for these green residues also indicated that extremes in plant structure, as created using parallel and perpendicular stalk orientations, can cause very large differences in the degree of attenuation.

ID SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; RADIOMETER; RADIATION; COVER
AB There has been significant progress in the application of microwave remote sensing for measuring soil moisture.  Both passive and active systems have demonstrated the capability to measure soil moisture, and there have been a number of studies using aircraft and spaceborne data that have demonstrated its usefulness for agricultural and hydrologic applications.  However, there are still several unresolved questions regarding the optimal instrument configuration and other target characteristics such as roughness and vegetation.  In addition, the most likely disciplines for using these data, agriculture and hydrology, do not currently possess adequate models or procedures to use this new technology.

ID SOLAR ZENITH ANGLE; INDEX GVI DATA; NOAA-AVHRR; CALIBRATION
AB Procedures that are currently applied to data from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) in deriving vegetation indices are analyzed. It is shown that the type of compositing used has a great impact on the final product. Some misconceptions concerning the global vegetation index (GVI) data set are discussed. Cloud-screened daily data over Kansas prairie during 1 month were used to develop a viewing angle correction for the observed range of sun angles and for that particular surface type. This example indicates that the variability in the calculated vegetation indices could be reduced, thus raising the confidence level in statistical comparisons of observations for different years. The correction developed is applied to a different crop area and improvement in the results is demonstrated. Errors in the calculations are analyzed. Prospects for future improvements in processing vegetation index data are discussed.

AB Previous studies have shown that the terrain elevation of the ICESat-2's ATL08 product is of good accuracy, overall, but in urban areas under complex surface conditions, the terrain elevation is vulnerable to the influence of the effect of dense buildings, resulting in deviations and even outliers. However, the previous studies have not effectively corrected these deviations and outliers. To this end, we propose a method for correcting the terrain elevation of the ATL08 product in urban areas, which is an auto-refinement method for the terrain elevation. Based on the data characteristics of this type of terrain elevation data and the distribution characteristics of urban buildings, the proposed method innovatively corrects the deviated part of the terrain elevation by a water pump deployment criterion with the vertical contour of the terrain. To increase its applicability, the proposed method uses a strategy of mixing the terrain elevation data that are from the strong- and weak-beam observations, allowing the deviated terrain in one beam with a higher missing data rate to be corrected with the aid of the other beam with a lower missing data rate. We used airborne LiDAR data from several areas (New York, Amsterdam, and Palmerston North) with different city sizes to validate the corrected results. The results show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the terrain elevation in urban areas is reduced from -4 m to -1 m after correction. The correction results also show that the proposed method can correct the deviated terrain elevation, while ensuring that the high-quality terrain elevation can be effectively retained.

AB Poverty is the leading cause of social instability around the world. Reducing poverty has become a crucial objective for global sustainable development. Timely and consistently monitoring poverty status plays a vital role in evaluating the efficiency of poverty reduction policies. Nighttime light images from satellites allow for frequent monitoring of poverty status by recording lighting intensity. The coarse spatial resolution of the recent, widely used, publicly available nighttime light images hinders research on smaller unit scales, such as county level. The SDGSAT-1 satellite, with a glimmer sensor and a spatial resolution of 10-m, was launched in 2021 to meet the sustainable development goals. This study proposes a model to sharpen the existing nighttime light images with a coarse spatial resolution to expand the available period of nighttime light images with a 10-m spatial resolution in discriminating illuminating ground objects. The expanded nighttime light images with discriminated illuminating ground objects are then utilized to calculate the time-series county-level poverty index for three typical Chinese urban agglomerations with a statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.675 (p < 0.01). Compared to the poverty statistics derived from the Chinese county statistical yearbook, the estimated poverty index can explore county-level poverty status change more effectively by completing the missing census. The time-series county-level poverty analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of Chinese endeavor in poverty reduction. >90% of the counties experienced a reduction in poverty in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region due to time-series economic development. Statistical analysis of the poverty index of impoverished counties demonstrates a remarkable reduction of poverty in the study areas and the significance of the persistent poverty reduction policy implementation. This study's proposed pipeline compensates for the lack of nighttime light images with a higher spatial resolution prior to 2021 and provides a reliable poverty analysis foundation for sustainable development and policymaking.

AB Mesoscale fronts are highly energetic ocean processes that dominate local biogeochemical processes and air-sea interactions and exert significant effects on ocean dynamics, ecology, and climate. An automatic front detection algorithm applied to satellite-based observations is a fundamental approach to acquiring frontal occurrence information. Histogram-based algorithms have been widely used in previous studies, and, despite being the most popular front detection algorithm, continuous improvements have been needed to address imperfect detection issues (undetected coastal fronts, discontinuities of fronts and repeated detection of fronts). In this study, a new algorithm is proposed to address the issues by coupling inverse distance weighting and mathematical morphology operators. Using 14,610 images acquired from 1982 to 2021, a series of comparisons between the new and existing algorithms have been implemented to validate the improvements. Statistical results suggest that the number of frontal pixels detected by our algorithm increased by 58.45% in the coastal domain when compared to previous methods. Statistical analysis also shows most of these increased fronts can be supported by a classic gradient-based method which is superior in detecting coastal fronts, which demonstrates the improvement of new algorithm in detecting coastal fronts. Furthermore, visual analyses suggest that our algorithm can better connect discontinuous fronts and reduce repeated detections, and statistical comparisons in the open seas present a 34.50% improvement in the average length of frontal segments. Moreover, based on an automated objective delineation method, an analysis of 40 years of seasonal frontal occurrences (as detected by our algorithm) produced a dataset that shows a detailed map of 59 persistent fronts around the China Seas. This map updates previously hand-delineated frontal positions and identifies some previously unreported persistent fronts. Further analyses show that the frontal occurrence or intensity of a majority of persistent fronts around the China Seas presents significant (P < 0.05) long-term variability over the last 40 years. The improved algorithm, together with its application in identifying persistent fronts around the China Seas, is expected to be extended to other waters to better investigate the response of marine ecosystems to front dynamics and predict the distribution of marine organisms within a changing climate.

AB Accurate monitoring of the spatial-temporal distribution and variability of phytoplankton group (PG) composition is of vital importance in better understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics and biogeochemical cycles. While existing bio-optical algorithms provide valuable information, relying solely on satellite ocean color data remains insufficient to obtain high-precision retrieval of PG due to the intricate nature of the bio-optical signal and PG composition itself. An interdisciplinary approach combining advancements in machine learning with big data from ocean observations and simulations offers a promising avenue for more accurate quantification of PG composition. In this study, an ensemble learning approach, called the spatial-temporal-ecological ensemble (STEE) model, is developed to construct a robust prediction model for eight distinct phytoplankton groups (i.e., Diatoms, Dinoflagellates, Haptophytes, Pelagophytes, Cryptophytes, Green Algae, Prokaryotes, and Prochlorococcus). The proposed method introduces multiple data simultaneously: ocean color, physical oceanographic, biogeochemical, and spatial and temporal information. An ensemble strategy is applied to increase the performance of the model by merging three advanced machine-learning algorithms. The combined validation of multiple cross-validation (CV) strategies (i.e., standard, spatial block, and temporal block CVs) shows that the proposed STEE model has superior robustness and generalization ability. In addition, the analysis shows a high degree of concordance between the independent datasets and the modeled estimations for long-time series sites, indicating that the STEE model is capable of effectively monitoring long-term trends in phytoplankton group composition. Finally, the proposed model was utilized to retrieve global monthly phytoplankton group products (STEE-PG) over an extended period (September 1997 to May 2020), and comparisons demonstrated better rationality of spatio-temporal distribution than existing satellite-derived phytoplankton group products. Hence, this new model comprehensively integrates all kinds of observation data and yields long-term global PG products with high accuracy, which will enhance our understanding of the response of marine ecosystems to environmental and climate change.

AB Satellite-based vegetation monitoring provides important insights regarding spatiotemporal variations in vegetation growth from a regional to continental scale. Most current vegetation monitoring methodologies rely on spectral vegetation indices (VIs) observed by polar-orbiting satellites, which provide one or a few observations per day. This study proposes a new methodology based on diurnal changes in land surface temperatures (LSTs) using Japan's geostationary satellite, Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI). AHI thermal infrared observation provides LSTs at 10-min frequencies and similar to 2 km spatial resolution. The DTC parameters that summarize the diurnal cycle waveform were obtained by fitting a diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) model to the time-series LST information for each day. To clarify the applicability of DTC parameters in detecting vegetation drying under humid climates, DTC parameters from in situ LSTs observed at vegetation sites, as well as those from Himawari-8 LSTs, were evaluated for East Asia. Utilizing the record-breaking heat wave that occurred in East Asia in 2018 as a case study, the anomalies of DTC parameters from the Himawari-8 LSTs were compared with the drying signals indicated by VIs, latent heat fluxes (LE), and surface soil moisture (SM). The results of site-based and satellite-based analyses revealed that DTR (diurnal temperature range) correlates with the evaporative fraction (EF) and SM, whereas T-max (daily maximum LST) correlates with LE and VIs. Regarding other temperature-related parameters, T-0 (LST around sunrise), T-a (temperature rise during daytime), and delta T (temperature fall during nighttime) are unstable in quantification by DTC model. Moreover, time-related parameters, such as t(m) (time reaching T-max), are more sensitive to topographic slope and geometric conditions than surface thermal properties at humid sites in East Asia, although they correlate with EF and SM at a semi-arid site in Australia. Additionally, the spatial distribution of the DTR anomaly during the 2018 heat wave corresponds with the drying signals indicated as negative SM anomalies. Regions with large positive anomalies in T-max and DTR correspond to area with visible damage to vegetation, as indicated by negative VI anomalies. Hence, combined T-max and DTR potentially detects vegetation drying indetectable by VIs, thereby providing earlier and more detailed vegetation monitoring in both humid and semi-arid climates.

AB Glaciers covered by debris are widespread in the Himalayas. Debris layer makes the melting process of glaciers complicated, and the correlation between the spatial melt differences of glacier and its surface features is still not clear. The aim of this study was to identify possible causes of thickness changes for Himalayan debris-covered glaciers. Firstly, three high resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) datasets including SRTM DEM, AW3D and TanDEM-X DEM were used to estimate glacier thickness changes from 2000 to 2013. By checking and removing geometric displacements, systematic deviations and elevation-related bias, as well as correction of radar wave penetration depth in the clean glacier areas, reliable thickness change information in this complex glaciated region were provided. Then debris thicknesses on the glaciers were estimated. The surface lowering caused by ice cliffs or supraglacial ponds significantly reduces debris thickness. Finally, some surface features including debris thicknesses, spatial patterns of supraglacial ponds and ice cliffs extracted from high-resolution satellite images in different times, were comprehensively used to evaluate the main drivers of glacier melting differences. Results demonstrate that spatial variability of glacier melting in Himalayas is caused by the combined effects of debris thicknesses, ice cliffs and supraglacial lakes, with different dominant factors for different regions. The thickened glacier region, which mostly appears above 5300 m a.s.l., with minimal debris cover, displayed large patches of thickening and partial serious thinning in the debris-free areas. Although the thick debris layer (> 0.20 m) would slow down the glacier melting at the low-elevations, it leads to the heavy glacier thinning for the regions located 5000-5300 m a.s.l., where there are dense ice cliffs. In some areas with >1 m of average debris thickness, glaciers have thinned slowly because of erosion from the ice cliffs or large supraglacial ponds. Area and number of cliffs have proven to be key factors in controlling regional ablation for debris-covered glaciers, and supraglacial lakes serve as assistance.

AB Satellite remote sensing of cloud property retrieval and shortwave downward radiation (SWDR) estimation is essential for global radiation budget and climate change studies. Sun glint areas remain a challenge for the existing cloud and SWDR algorithms based on the visible channel since surface specular reflection has a sig-nificant impact on satellite retrieval. In this study, a set of algorithms for cloud detection and cloud microphysical parameter estimation were developed using infrared multichannel data from the new generation geostationary satellite Himawari-8 based on the random forest method. The results indicated that the cloud retrieval algorithm exhibited better performance in the sun glint areas where the official Himawari-8 products (cloud detection and cloud optical thickness) were overestimated. We developed a new SWDR estimation algorithm combining the radiative transfer model and machine learning techniques by considering the cloud properties from the cloud retrieval algorithm. The results indicated that the SWDR and cloud radiative forcing derived by the new algo-rithm were more consistent with those of the well-known radiation products Cloud and the Earth's Radiant Energy System than those estimated using the official-based cloud product, with decreases in the root mean square error of approximately 22% and 41%, respectively. The new algorithms effectively addressed sun glint contamination by providing more data coverage and exhibiting stable performance on a spatiotemporal scale.

AB Biodiversity loss is one of the most relevant consequences of climate change. Therefore, identifying areas and environmental features that allow certain organisms to be less exposed to the effects of the current global warming is priority for biodiversity conservation. In this study, we describe a novel approach for the identification of microclimatic refugia in rugged mountain areas, specifically for the detection of most thermally stable areas, using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) capable of recording in the visible and thermal infrared spectral bands. We estimated land surface temperatures (LST) at very-high spatial resolution in six topographically complex sectors of the Pyrenees (NE Spain), across seasons with vegetative activity (summer 2020, autumn 2020, spring 2021, and summer 2021), and at two thermally contrasted times of the day (early in the morning: LSTmin, and in the afternoon: LSTmax). LST were validated with a network of miniaturized temperature sensors in the field. LSTmin and LSTmax allowed us to calculate the daily thermal range of each sector across the seasons, and thus the most thermally stable areas over the year. To reveal the importance of different variables on low and narrow thermal ranges we applied Gradient Boosted Models to seven terrain variables derived from ALS-LiDAR (slope, northness, eastness, heat load, wind exposure index, SAGA's topographic wetness index, and vector ruggedness measure) and a proxy of forest density through the three-dimensional point clouds of the UAV data. The northness was the variable that most promoted thermal stability, followed by the slope and forest density, so that microclimatic refugia resulted to be located in northern slopes, small sites under rocky cliffs, and forested areas. Our results demonstrate that thermal UAVs can become promising tools for the identification of microclimatic refugia in topographically complex areas, providing information at unprecedented spatial resolution, and thus of high interest for biodiversity conservation.

AB Climate change is expected to intensify the global hydrological cycle via increased evapotranspiration (ET). Changes in ET have important consequences for water-related ecosystem services as well as for forest produc-tivity. Forests play a critical role in ET: active trees sequester carbon at the expense of losing water, yet if they are not active, water remains in the trees, but productivity stalls. We estimated the capacity of forests to recover (resilience) from extreme water or productivity losses based on modeled ET through remote sensing methods across the conterminous USA. Results show there is a spatial tradeoff in resilience to water or productivity losses. Forests were more resilient to water loss in the drier west, and more resilient to productivity loss in the wetter east. Still, resilience was highly heterogeneous across the continent. Projections under climate change indicate both declines and increases of up to 13% in forest resilience, with broad regional trends but high spatial het-erogeneity within regions. This study brings crucial satellite-based insights on how water dynamics, and consequentially productivity and water provision in forests, might be impacted by climate change.

AB The increasing availability of 3-D urban data yields new insights into urban developments and their implications for population density, energy consumption, and the carbon budget. However, existing products of urban building heights at a regional or global scale are mostly subject to coarse grid size or long-time lags. Fineresolution building height maps remain unavailable for most regions to present recent vertical information. Also, the lack of sampled building heights with spatial and temporal consistency at larger scales makes it difficult to update building height maps. The newly available spaceborne lidar data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) are expected to overcome these critical barriers. Here we propose a generalizable approach to mapping large-scale distributions of building heights by fusing GEDI-derived relative height metrics, optical data (i.e., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2), and radar data (Sentinel-1). We applied our approach to the Yangtze River Delta region (YRD), one of China's largest urban agglomerations. We investigated the availability of building height samples generated from GEDI-based relative height metrics and the optimal grid size of building height mapping into 30-m (about footprint level) and 150-m (regional level) grid sizes. We finally developed a random forest model using active and passive sensors to extrapolate GEDI-derived samples discretely to the continuous building height map at the 150-m grid size in 2019. We revealed the spatial distribution patterns of building heights and the urbanization effect on the city's mean building heights in the YRD region. We found that: (1) GEDI-derived building height samples were highly consistent with the reference building height data at the footprint (i.e., Pearson's r = 0.86, RMSE = 9.25 m, n = 237) and regional (i.e., Pearson's r = 0.76, RMSE = 6.36 m, n = 69) levels. (2) The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the final spatially continuous and up-to-date building height map were 0.85 and 5.03 m, respectively. (3) The resulting map showed a strong positive correlation between the city's mean building height and urbanization level. Our work makes it possible to use remotely sensed data to make global maps of building heights at a 150-m scale.

AB Peatlands throughout the boreal forest are expected to experience changes in precipitation, evapotranspiration and temperature due to climate change. Correspondingly, changes in hydrologic regimes could lead to increased drought and occurrence of wildfire. Fire management agencies require information about near-real time wildfire vulnerability in boreal peatlands. Remote sensing tools (e.g., NDVI, NDII) used to monitor changing wildfire vulnerability focus on monitoring changes in vascular vegetation and are not necessarily applicable to moss -dominated peatlands. We use time series analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter data to compare the trends in peatlands that have burned to unburned peatlands and show that the Theil-Sen slopes of seasonally decomposed SAR backscatter reflects prolonged drought conditions that can lead to burning. Seasonally decomposed Sentinel -2 NDVI and NDII were also tested but no statistical differences were found between burned and unburned peatlands. Overall, we found that 6 months prior to a wildfire the slope of seasonally decomposed Sentinel-1 VV SAR backscatter was significantly different in burned and unburned peatlands, and can be used to spatially identify fire vulnerability and identify fire-prone areas.

AB Remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) has become one of primary observational sources for urban climate research. However, LST is subject to considerable angular variation, particularly in urban areas caused by a large variation of sensor viewing angles and non-isothermal facades of 3D urban structures. Anisotropy varies seasonally and diurnally, and is sensitive to sensor viewing geometry, solar angles, and urban surface properties. Current studies focus on urban thermal anisotropy of individual cities, comparative study and the resultant driving factor analysis are still lacking. To bridge this critical knowledge gap, a systematic comparative assessment of satellite-based urban thermal anisotropy is required. Here, we modify and validate a satellite-based anisotropy estimation approach and compare the seasonal and diurnal anisotropy variations over 25 global cities to answer the following research questions: 1) How do the anisotropy magnitude and profile shapes vary among different cities? 2) What are the factors influencing the anisotropy? The results show that off-nadir observations are up to 3.5 K cooler on average than nadir LST during summer whereas the effective anisotropy ranges between 2.1 K and 5.8 K for all cities. Winter anisotropy is much smaller (similar to 1 K), where the warm or cold bias is determined by solar zenith angle (morning/afternoon overpasses), and its bias magnitude is linearly proportional to the sensor zenith angle. Urban thermal anisotropy is partly influenced by geographic location (e.g., latitude, longitude), urban vegetation (measured by NDVI) and urban geometry (building height-street width ratio, h/w), where low latitude cities or cities with less vegetation tend to have a greater angular variation in summer, and the anisotropy tends to increase with more complex urban morphology (i.e., higher building aspect ratio). High vegetation cover makes the anisotropy distribution shape more asymmetric along the cross-track direction (or sensor zenith angle). Our findings help understand the seasonal and diurnal impact of anisotropy for wide-swath LST applications in cities and offers insights for addressing anisotropy in future satellite products.

AB Field inventoried data are often used as references (ground truth) in forest remote sensing studies. However, the reference values are affected by various kinds of errors, which tend to make the reported accuracies of the remote sensing-based predictions worse than they are. The more accurate the remote sensing techniques are becoming, the more pronounced this problem will be. This paper addresses the impact of uncertainties in field reference data due to measurement errors, model errors, and position errors when evaluating the accuracy of biomass predictions from airborne laser scanning at plot level. We present novel theoretical analysis methods that take the interactions of the error sources into account. Further, an error characterization model (ECM) is used to describe the error structure of the remote sensing-based predictions, and we show how the parameters of the ECM can be adjusted when field references contain errors. We also show how root mean square error (RMSE) estimates can be adjusted. Based on data from Scandinavian forests, we conclude that the field reference errors have an impact on the remote sensing-based predictions. By accounting for these errors the RMSE of the remote sensing-based predictions was reduced by 6-18%. The most influential sources of error in the field references were found to be the residual errors of the allometric biomass model and the field plot position errors. Together, these two sources accounted for 97% of the variance while measurement errors and biomass model parameter uncertainties were negligible in our study.

AB Monitoring oceanographic parameters is essential for marine engineering construction, coastal safety, marine analysis, and climatic analysis. Traditionally, oceanographic parameters have been monitored using different sensors. With the development of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations have been found to oscillate due to the interference between direct and reflected signals. GNSS-interferometry reflectometry (GNSS-IR) utilizes the characteristics of these oscillations to retrieve the parameters of a reflecting surface. For GNSS marine application, GNSS-IR sea-level retrieval technology has considerably improved and is undergoing rapid development; however, only a few studies have estimated significant wave height (SWH) and wind direction using GNSS-IR. The cut-off elevation, an SNR parameter, is the elevation angle at which the dominant power of one SNR arc switches between coherent and incoherent energy and is related to SWH and wind direction. Methods to estimate SWH and wind direction were presented based on the cut-off elevation. Moreover, we introduced the Generalized Shallow Water Wave Growth (GSWWG) model to estimate the wave peak period based on retrieved SWH. The sea level, wind direction, SWH, and wave peak period were estimated using a geodetic GNSS receiver. Data were collected before and after Hurricane Delta using the GNSS site CALC, Louisiana, USA. First, the classical GNSS-IR method was used to retrieve sea levels. Second, the wavelet analysis method was processed to SNR arcs to form wavelet spectra showing the nonstationary power and estimate their cut-off elevations. Third, the lower cut-off elevation was used to estimate the wind direction, and the upper cut-off elevation was used to estimate the SWH. Finally, the wave peak period was estimated from the retrieved SWH based on the GSWWG model. The results showed a root mean square error of 4.72 cm between sea-level measurements and sea-level retrievals, and a correlation coefficient > 80% between wind speed measurements and SWH retrievals estimated from GPS L5 and GLONASS R2. The points of SWH retrievals vs. wind speeds of GPS L5 and GLONASS R2 corresponded well to the wind-SWH relationship deduced from the GSWWG model. These results indicated that GNSS-IR technology could estimate the wave peak period in addition to its previously known applications for retrieving sea level, wind direction, and SWH, providing additional oceanographic services.

AB River monitoring is an open issue due to many intrinsic problems of the ground monitoring network. Over the last few decades, the role of satellite sensors in river discharge estimation is significantly increased thanks to the strong growth in technologies and applications. Focusing on daily river discharge measurements, a non-linear regression model has been used to link the near-infrared (NIR) reflectance ratio between a dry and a wet pixel around the section of a river to the ground measurements of river discharge. The use of medium-resolution satellite data, such as those from MODIS sensors, enables to monitor high and low flows in medium-sized catchments (<100,000 km2), thanks to satellite frequent revisit time and wide spatial coverage. However, such sensors are not suitable to provide information for medium-narrow rivers (< 250 m wide), nor to study river features and patterns that are averaged within a single pixel. Here, we investigated the use of Sentinel-2 NIR reflectances to support the hypothesis that a higher spatial resolution, i.e. 10 m, is able to better identify the wet pixels, more related to the river dynamics, with obvious advantages for river discharge estimation compared to the medium resolution sensors (e.g., MODIS at 250 m). Moreover, it also allows both a finer distinction between vegetation, soil and water and the characterization of water turbidity in the river area. A new formulation enriched by the sediment component is proposed together with a first step toward an uncalibrated procedure to select the wet pixels. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform has been employed for the data analysis, allowing to avoid the download of big amounts of data, fostering the reproducibility of the analysis in different locations. The accuracy of the river discharges derived from Sentinel-2 reflectances is evaluated against the in-situ observations from selected gauging stations along two Italian rivers, Po and Tiber. The results confirm the good performances obtained with high-resolution images over the Po River, with average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranging between 0.39 and 0.56 for the different configurations adopted. Relatively worse results were obtained over the Tiber River where the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranged between 0.2 and 0.61, due to an issue on the registration of Sentinel-2 images.

AB The objective of this study was to explore the effects of (1) the presence/absence of snow and snow depth, (2) solar noise, i.e., day/night and sun angle observations, and (3) strong/weak beam differences on ICESat2 data in the context of data utility for forest AGB estimation. The framework of the study is multiphase modeling, where AGB field data and wall-to-wall airborne laser scanning (ALS) and Sentinel-2 data are used to produce proxy ALS plots on ICESat-2 track positions. Models between the predicted proxy AGB and the ICESat-2 photon data are then formulated and evaluated by subsets, such as only strong beam data captured in snowy conditions.
   Our results indicate that, if possible, strong beam night data from snowless conditions should be used in AGB estimation, because our models showed clearly smallest RMSE (26.9%) for this data subset. If more data are needed, we recommend using only strong beam data and constructing separate models for the different data subsets. In the order of increasing RMSE%, the next best options were snow/night/strong (30.4%), snow/day/strong (33.5%), and snowless/day/strong (34.1%). Weak beam data from snowy night conditions could also be used if necessary (31.0%).

AB Cloud cover is a major limiting factor in exploiting time-series data acquired by optical spaceborne remote sensing sensors. Multiple methods have been developed to address the problem of cloud detection in satellite imagery and a number of cloud masking algorithms have been developed for optical sensors but very few studies have carried out quantitative intercomparison of state-of-the-art methods in this domain. This paper summarizes results of the first Cloud Masking Intercomparison eXercise (CMIX) conducted within the Committee Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV). CEOS is the forum for space agency coordination and cooperation on Earth observations, with activities organized under working groups. CMIX, as one such activity, is an international collaborative effort aimed at intercomparing cloud detection algorithms for moderate-spatial resolution (10-30 m) spaceborne optical sensors. The focus of CMIX is on open and free imagery acquired by the Landsat 8 (NASA/USGS) and Sentinel-2 (ESA) missions. Ten algorithms developed by nine teams from fourteen different organizations representing universities, research centers and industry, as well as space agencies (CNES, ESA, DLR, and NASA), are evaluated within the CMIX. Those algo-rithms vary in their approach and concepts utilized which were based on various spectral properties, spatial and temporal features, as well as machine learning methods. Algorithm outputs are evaluated against existing reference cloud mask datasets. Those datasets vary in sampling methods, geographical distribution, sample unit (points, polygons, full image labels), and generation approaches (experts, machine learning, sky images). Overall, the performance of algorithms varied depending on the reference dataset, which can be attributed to differences in how the reference datasets were produced. The algorithms were in good agreement for thick cloud detection, which were opaque and had lower uncertainties in their identification, in contrast to thin/semi-transparent clouds detection. Not only did CMIX allow identification of strengths and weaknesses of existing algorithms and potential areas of improvements, but also the problems associated with the existing reference datasets. The paper concludes with recommendations on generating new reference datasets, metrics, and an analysis framework to be further exploited and additional input datasets to be considered by future CMIX activities.

AB Vegetation responds at varying temporal scales to changing soil water availability. These process dynamics complicate assessments of plant-water relations but also offer various access points to advance understanding of vegetation responses to environmental change. Remote sensing (RS) provides large capacity to quantify sensitive and robust information of vegetation responses and underlying abiotic change driver across observational scales. Retrieved RS based vegetation parameters are often sensitive to various environmental and plant specific factors in addition to the targeted plant response. Further, individual plant responses to water limitation act at different temporal and spatial scales, while RS sampling schemes are often not optimized to assess these dynamics. The combination of these aspects complicates the interpretation of RS parameter when assessing plant-water relations. We consequently aim to advance insight on the sensitivity of physiological, biochemical and structural RS parameter for plant adaptation in response to emerging soil water limitation. We made a field experiment in maize in Tuscany (Central Italy), while irrigation was stopped in some areas of the drip-irrigated field. Within a period of two weeks, we measured the hydraulic and physiological state of maize plants in situ and complemented these detailed measurements with extensive airborne observations (e.g. sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), vegetation indices sensitive for photosynthesis, pigment and water content, land surface temperature). We observe a double response of far-red SIF with a short-term increase after manifestation of soil water limitation and a decrease afterwards. We identify different response times of RS parameter representing different plant adaptation mechanisms ranging from short term responses (e.g. stomatal conductance, photosynthesis) to medium term changes (e.g. pigment decomposition, changing leaf water content). Our study demonstrates complementarity of common and new RS parameter to mechanistically assess the complex cascade of functional, biochemical and structural plant responses to evolving soil water limitation.

AB Drought is a recurring, complex, and extreme climatic phenomenon characterized by subnormal precipitation for months to years triggering negative impacts on agriculture, energy, tourism, recreation, and transportation sectors. Agricultural drought assessment is based on a deficit of soil moisture (SM) during the plant-growing season, whereas meteorological drought corresponds to subnormal precipitation over months to years. However, satellite-derived agricultural and meteorological drought indices (including those comprising root-zone SM) have not been comprehensively compared to evaluate their ability for drought delineation and particularly forecasting across climate regimes, land cover and soil types, and irrigation management (irrigated vs. rainfed) in the contiguous USA (CONUS). Here, we did so from 2015 to 2019 within the CONUS. In most regions except the US Midwest and Southeast, SM-based indices (e.g., Palmer Z, SMAP, SWDI) delineated agricultural drought better than meteorological (e.g., SPI, SPEI) and hybrid (Comprehensive Drought Index, CDI) drought indices. In contrast, the SPI and SPEI showed strong correlation with the aridity index in most part of the CONUS except the Midwest. SM-based and hybrid indices also demonstrated skills for agricultural drought forecasting (represented by end-of-year cumulative GPP), predominantly in the early growing season and particularly in irrigated rather than rainfed croplands. These findings indicate the leading role of SM in controlling ecosystem dryness and confirm "drought memory", possibly due to SM-memory in land-atmosphere coupling. Proper application of meteorological and agricultural drought indices and their contrasting spatial-temporal controls on plant growth and ecosystem dryness has the potential to improve our understanding of drought evolution and provide early drought forecasting across large regions with diverse climate regimes, land cover types, soil textural classes, and irrigation management.

AB Research of PM2.5 chronic health effects requires knowledge of large-scale and long-term exposure that is not supported by newly established monitoring networks due to their sparse spatial coverage and lack of historical measurements. Estimating PM2.5 using satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) can be used to fill the data gap left by the ground monitors and extend the PM2.5 data coverage to suburban and rural areas over long time periods. Two approaches have been applied in large-scale and long-term satellite remote sensing of PM2.5, i.e., the scaling and statistical approaches. Compared to the scaling method, the statistical approach has greater prediction accuracy and has been widely used. There is a gap in the current literature and review papers on how the statistical methods work and specific considerations to best utilize them, especially for large-scale and longterm estimates. In this critical review, we summarize the evolution of large-scale and long-term PM2.5 statistical models reported in the literature. We describe the framework and guidance of large-scale and long-term satellite based PM2.5 modeling in data preparation, model development, validation, and predictions. Sample computer codes are provided to expedite new model-building efforts. We also include useful considerations and recommendations in covariates selection, addressing the spatiotemporal heterogeneities of PM2.5-AOD relationships, and the usage of cross validation, to aid the determination of the final model.

AB Settlements, and in particular cities, are at the center of key future challenges related to global change and sustainable development. Widely used indicators to assess the efficiency and sustainability of settlement development are the compactness and density of the built-up area. However, at global scale, a temporally consistent and spatially detailed survey of the distribution and concentration of the building stock - meaning the total area and volume of buildings within a defined spatial unit or settlement, commonly referred to as building density - does not yet exist. To fill this data and knowledge gap, an approach was developed to map key characteristics of the world's building stock in a so far unprecedented level of spatial detail for every single settlement on our planet. The resulting World Settlement Footprint 3D dataset quantifies the fraction, total area, average height, and total volume of buildings for a measuring grid with 90 m cell size. The World Settlement Footprint 3D is generated using a modified version of the World Settlement Footprint human settlements mask derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery at 10 m spatial resolution, in combination with 12 m digital elevation data and radar imagery collected by the TanDEM-X mission. The underlying, automated processing framework includes three basic workflows: one estimating the mean building height based on an analysis of height differences along potential building edges, a second module determining the building fraction and total building area within each 90 m cell, and a third part combining the height information and building area in order to determine the average height and total built-up volume at 90 m gridding. Optionally, a simple 3D building model (level of detail 1) can be generated for regions where data on the building footprints is available. A comprehensive validation campaign based on 3D building models obtained for 19 regions (similar to 86,000 km(2)) and street-view samples indicating the number of floors for >130,000 individual buildings in 15 additional cities documents that the novel World Settlement Footprint 3D data provides valuable and, for the first time, globally consistent information on key characteristics of the building stock in both, large urban agglomerations as well as small-scale rural settlements. Thus, the new dataset represents a promising baseline dataset for a wide range of previously impossible environmental, socioeconomic, and climatological studies worldwide.

AB Accurately estimating the dynamics of ecosystem photosynthesis in coastal wetlands is of paramount importance to the quantification of blue carbon and climate change. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence at 760 nm (SIF760) and the gross primary productivity (GPP), as well as the underlying mechanisms in coastal salt marshes that are regularly flooded by tides, based on continuous observations of the SIF760 and GPP throughout the growing season of Phragmites australis during 2019. The results show that the SIF760 was significantly correlated with the GPP on the half-hourly, daily, and weekly scales in different phenological stages, and the linearity of the SIF760-GPP relationship generally improved as the time scale increased. Moreover, we found that the canopy structure (i.e., leaf area index and spatial distribution of leaf angles) plays a major role in explaining the relationship between the SIF760 and photosynthesis on half-hourly and daily scales at the study site. Tidal flooding significantly suppressed the strength of the correlation between SIF760 and GPP in the early and rapid growth vegetation stage. Furthermore, the tides generally lowered the degree of the correlation between the light use efficiency for photosynthesis (LUEp) and the SIF yield, and between the LUEp and the canopy SIF760 escape probability. This indicates that tidal inundation diminished the roles of the plant physiology and canopy structure in explaining the relationship between the SIF760 and photosynthesis, and thus, it had a negative effect on the SIF760-based GPP estimation. The results of this study demonstrate that tidal inundation exerts a significant influence on the relationships between the SIF760 and GPP and their responses to the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, which leads to a better understanding of the mechanism linking the SIF760 and photosynthesis in tidal wetlands and provides new insights into reliable blue carbon quantification in a large scale domain.

AB Accurate, robust and consistent coastline mapping is critical for characterising and managing coastal change. Satellite earth observation provides an unparalleled source of freely available data for studying dynamic coastlines through time and across large spatial extents. However, previous satellite-derived shoreline mapping approaches have been challenged by two key limitations: the medium spatial resolution of freely available satellite data, and the confounding influence of tides that can obscure longer term patterns of coastal change. In this study we present Digital Earth Australia Coastlines, a new continental dataset documenting three decades of coastal change across Australia. We combine sub-pixel waterline extraction with a new pixel-based tidal modelling method to seamlessly map almost 2 million km of tide-datum shorelines along the entire Australian coast from 1988 to 2019. Our tidally-constrained median composite approach maps the dominant annual position of the shoreline at 0 m Above Mean Sea Level each year, suppressing the short-term influence of tides and sub-annual shoreline variability. Using this robust mid-term shoreline proxy, long-term coastal change rates spanning the last three decades were accurately quantified and mapped at the continental scale. We find that 22% of Australia's non-rocky coastline has retreated or grown significantly since 1988, with 16% changing at greater than 0.5 m per year. Although trends of retreat and growth were closely balanced across the Australian continent, our results highlight significant regional variability and extreme local hotspots of coastal change. Our findings provide new insights into patterns and trends of coastal change across Australia, and highlight advantages and limitations of tide modelling and composite-based methods for extracting consistent shoreline data and long-term coastal trends from earth observation data at continental scale. Digital Earth Australia Coastlines is made available to the public as free and open interactive tools and code to support future coastal research and management across Australia, and any coastal region globally with access to free and open medium resolution satellite data.

AB Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals are affected by the Earth's ionosphere when the signals travel through the ionosphere. We first analyze the impact of ionospheric variation on the coseismic deformation results derived from interferometric SAR (InSAR) for the 2010 Maule, Chile, earthquake. We then jointly invert leveling, GPS and InSAR data for the coseismic slip distribution. The bias in the inverted slip distribution caused by the ionospheric variation is especially investigated. Our results show that mitigating the effect of ionospheric artifacts on long wavelengths, such as the L-band, InSAR data is critical to studying some strong earthquakes. It is therefore advisable at least as a precaution to check the level of significance of the ionospheric artifacts when studying strong earthquakes with InSAR, and when the artifacts are found to be significant, corrections for the artifacts should be applied. This research also indicates that megathrust rupturing occurred mainly at two asperities with peak slip magnitudes reaching 15.7 m and 9.8 m. More importantly, generally unlike the common existing understanding, our results show that the rupture reached the trench only in the northern segment of the trench (near 34.9 degrees S-35.4 degrees S).

AB As the spatial and temporal resolution of remotely sensed imagery has improved over the last four decades, algorithms for monitoring and mapping seasonal changes in surface properties have evolved rapidly. Most recently, the availability of daily PlanetScope imagery has created new opportunities for monitoring the land surface phenology (LSP) of terrestrial ecosystems at high spatial resolution. However, the quality and value of LSP information from PlanetScope imagery have not been systematically examined. In this paper, we evaluate the character and quality of LSP information derived from PlanetScope by comparing time series of vegetation indices and LSP metrics from PlanetScope to corresponding time series and LSP metrics derived from Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery and PhenoCams at six sites that span a diverse range of land cover types and climate. Results show that vegetation index time series from all three data sources show high temporal correlation, and LSP metrics derived from HLS, PlanetScope, and PhenoCam show high agreement with negligible bias. Semi-variograms for phenometrics estimated from PlanetScope imagery indicate that the majority of spatial variance captured in PlanetScope phenometrics occurs well below the spatial resolution HLS imagery. At the same time, LSP metrics from HLS are most strongly correlated with the 50-75% quantiles of 3 m LSP metrics from PlanetScope. This indicates that HLS captures the average phenology at sub-pixel scale captured in PlanetScope imagery. Our results represent the first comprehensive comparison of LSP metrics estimated from PlanetScope and publicly available moderate spatial resolution imagery, and provide insights regarding: (1) the quality and character of LSP metrics derived from HLS and PlanetScope; and (2) the relative merits and trade-offs associated with the use of each data source for LSP studies.

AB Surface soil moisture is estimated by inverting physical scattering models for low-crops using L-band airborne SAR data over the incidence angle range from 30 to 50 degrees. The forward simulation is accurate with 1.7, 1.8, and 2.3 dB rmse for grass, wheat (including oat and forage), and soybean respectively assessed over 38 fields and during the full growth period for soybean. Dominant scattering mechanisms revealed by the model are found consistent across the incidence angle range: surface (VV) and double bounce (HH) for grass, double bounce for both polarization of wheat, and surface (young plant) and volume (mature plant) for both polarization of soy-bean. The model fidelity is robust across incidence angles between 30 and 50 degrees, benefiting from rigorously simulating the three scattering mechanisms and successfully simulating the effect of vegetation and roughness.
   The soil moisture estimates are accurate to unbiased rmse of 0.041, 0.059 and 0.060 m(3)/m(3) and correlation of 0.71, 0.83, and 0.69 for grass, wheat, and soybean fields, respectively over the soil moisture dynamic range up to 0.5 m(3)/m(3), and soybean's full growth cycle. Vegetation water content and surface roughness are retrieved simultaneously to the soil moisture solutions, thus constraining the inversion of soil moisture. The retrieval performance is fairly uniform across the incidence angle, partly because of the reliable forward modeling across the incidence angle and also thanks to the reliable retrieval strategy. The robustness against the incidence angle supports frequent global mapping.
   The use of both HH and VV offers superior soil moisture retrievals than single-channel VV or HH input per-foms, by 0.034 m(3)/m(3) unbiased rmse for grass and by 0.01 m(3)/m(3) for wheat and soybean. The VV-based retrieval performed better than HH for grass and soybean, where surface scattering was important, but either choice resulted in similar retrieval accuracy for double-bounce dominanted wheat. No need for quad-pol and multi-angular observations would allow the retrieval approach to be applicable for spaceborne global mapping.

This is because of the unique reflectance spectral shapes of the BSC image slicks, where a sharp and monotonic increase in reflectance is found at wavelengths >550 nm and two inflection points are found around similar to 550 nm and similar to 650 nm. Such spectral characteristics differentiate BSC slicks from other floating matters. Based on this principle, a deep learning model is developed to extract BSC features from MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, 2002-2012) and OLCI (Ocean and Land Color Instrument, 2016 - present) satellite images to quantify BSC abundance, spatial distribution patterns, and their temporal changes in the Great Salt Lake (GSL), the world's largest contributor of BSC commercial products. A clear seasonality is found in BSC abundance, with the primary peak in April - May and secondary peak in October - November. The two peaks may be explained by food availability to brine shrimp. The inter-annual variability and the recent increasing trend in BSC abundance, on the other hand, are difficult to explain by fluctuations in wind, temperature, or salinity, while recent increase in commercial harvest does not appear to be associated with the variability in BSC abundance estimated by satellites. Because many salt lakes around the world, for example the Aral Sea, Lake Urmia, and the Dead Sea, also show BSC slicks in satellite imagery, this study suggests that it is possible to perform a systematic evaluation of BSC abundance and possibly brine shrimp populations in all major salt lakes, especially under a changing climate and increased human activities.

AB The diurnal and annual cycles of Earth drive the land surface temperature (LST) variations in space and time but their combined effects are conveyed differently from place to place as a function of climate, local weather conditions, and surface characteristics. Fitting a model of the diurnal or annual LST cycle (DTC and ATC, respectively) to satellite data yields several parameters that summarize the thermal dynamics of each pixel. These parameters are distinct for each place and reveal how the ATC and DTC differ between pixels. Currently, due to the lack of LST with high spatial and temporal resolution, it is impossible to characterize both cycles at kilometer or sub-kilometer scale. This work addresses this problem and presents a method for simultaneously quantifying the annual and diurnal LST dynamics at kilometer scale. The proposed method is based on Annual Cycle Parameters (ACP) retrieved from geostationary satellite data for every 30 min between 00:00 and 23:30 local time and uses statistical downscaling to enhance their coarse spatial resolution. We apply our method to continental Europe for the period 2009-2013 and validate it using independent ACP retrieved from satellite and in-situ LST. Our results reveal how the climate and surface conditions influence the shape of the ACP diurnal profiles over Europe and illustrate for the first time the excellent agreement between satellite-derived ACP and ACP derived from in-situ LST. Even though our method is limited by the spatial coverage of the geostationary data, it provides a novel way for describing Earth's thermal response to solar heating.

AB Land cover mapping over large areas is essential to address a wide spectrum of socio-environmental challenges. For this reason, many global or regional land cover products are regularly released to the scientific community. Yet, the remote sensing community has not fully addressed the challenge to extract useful information from vast volumes of satellite data. Especially, major limitations concern the use of inadequate classification schemes and "black box" methods that may not match with end-users conceptualization of geographic features. In this paper, we introduce a knowledge-driven methodological approach to automatically process Sentinel-2 time series in order to produce pre-classifications that can be adapted by end-users to match their requirements. The approach relies on a conceptual framework inspired from ontologies of scientific observation and geographic information to describe the representation of geographic entities in remote sensing images. The implementation consists in a three-stage classification system including an initial stage, a dichotomous stage and a modular stage. At each stage, the system firstly relies on natural language semantic descriptions of time series of spectral signatures before assigning labels of land cover classes. The implementation was tested on 75 time series of Sentinel-2 images (i.e. 2069 images) in the Southern Brazilian Amazon to map natural vegetation and water bodies as required by a local end-user, i.e. a non-governmental organization. The results confirmed the potential of the method to accurately detect water bodies (F-score = 0.874 for bodies larger than 10 m) and map natural vegetation (max F-score = 0.875), yet emphasizing the spatial heterogeneity of accuracy results. In addition, it proved to be efficient to provide rapid estimates of degraded riparian forests at watershed level (R2 = 0.871). Finally, we discuss potential improvements both in the system's implementation, e.g. considering additional characteristics, and in the conceptual framework, e.g. moving from pixel- to object-based image analysis and evolving towards a hybrid system combining data- and knowledge-driven approaches.

AB We present CO(2 )emission estimates for twenty power plants and related facilities in the United States, India, South Africa, Poland, Russia and South Korea, derived from space-based CO2 observations from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite. Improvements to OCO-2 data quality and to our methodology yield improved results relative to earlier work. These new results include emission quantification for both larger and smaller power plants, the first power plant emission estimate based on ocean glint data and emissions from a small city with multiple industrial facilities. CO2 emission estimates are compared against reported facility emissions where available, including high temporal resolution data for the eight US sites. The difference with respect to reported values for the US sites ranges from 1.4% to 26.7%, with a mean of 15.1%, although the estimated emission sum for all US sites is within 0.8% of the reported value, suggesting the errors are largely random. This finding reinforces the importance of revisit rate for future space-based emission monitoring systems and furthermore confirms that making multiple overpasses of a power plant can reduce errors to an accuracy useful to support climate policy.

AB We present a three-step inverse model (3SAA) for estimating the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of surface waters from the remote sensing reflectance spectra, Rrs(lambda). The derived IOPs include the total (a(lambda)), phytoplankton (aphy(lambda)), and colored detrital matter (acdm(lambda)), absorption coefficients, and the total (bb(lambda)) and particulate (bbp(lambda)) backscattering coefficients. The first step uses an improved neural network approach to estimate the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance from Rrs. a(lambda) and bbp(lambda) are then estimated using the LS2 model (Loisel et al., 2018), which does not require spectral assumptions on IOPs and hence can assess a (lambda) and bb(lambda) at any wavelength at which Rrs(lambda) is measured. Then, an inverse optimization algorithm is combined with an optical water class (OWC) approach to assess aphy(lambda) and acdm(lambda) from anw(lambda).The proposed model is evaluated using an in situ dataset collected in open oceanic, coastal, and inland waters. Comparisons with other standard semi-analytical algorithms (QAA and GSM), as well as match-up exercises, have also been performed. The applicability of the algorithm on OLCI observations was assessed through the analysis of global IOPs spatial patterns derived from 3SAA and GSM. The good performance of 3SAA is manifested by median absolute percentage differences (MAPD) of 13%, 23%, 34% and 34% for bbp(443), anw(443), aphy(443) and acdm(443), respectively for oceanic waters. Due to the absence of spectral constraints on IOPs in the inversion of total IOPs, and the adoption of an OWC-based approach, the performance of 3SAA is only slightly degraded in bio-optical complex inland waters.
