AB This paper aims to quantify the precision of retracked Jason-2 altimeter sea level data (2008-2016) in the 0-5 km Australian coastal zone. A new retracking strategy has been developed to achieve the highest possible precision of coastal sea-level data. Coastal waveforms were classified into four groups according to the adaptability of dedicated coastal retrackers, from which each group was reprocessed using an optimal retracker. A modified Brown model was introduced to reprocess the quasi-specular waveforms over calm waters. A seamless transition of sea surface heights from different retrackers was achieved by estimating and removing the significant wave height dependent height differences. In order to generate the 20-Hz sea level anomaly (SLA) and total water level envelope (TWLE) at the coast, the regional along-track mean sea surface (MSS) with a high spatial resolution (-300 m) was estimated. Compared to the global MSS model, the use of the along-track MSS has dramatically reduced the SLA variance by 140 cm2 in the 0-15 km coastal strip. The results from the evaluation of data precision for Jason-2 ground tracks and the validation against tide gauges show that this new retracking strategy can retrieve more reliable sea level data nearshore. The precision of 20-Hz sea level data in the 0-5 km Australian coastal strip ranges typically from 5 cm to 6 cm in most coastal areas, which is only -1 cm lower than that beyond 5 km off the coastline. However, in Northwest Australian and some coastal regions, the data precision drops to >= 7 cm due partly to the specific coastal sea states and topography. In addition, it is found that the altimeter and tide gauge TWLE time series have a high correlation (>0.8) in the 0-5 km distance band, indicating that coastal sea-level data are useful for applications such as estimation of river plumes, long-term variation of water level in lakes and rivers, and the analysis of storm surges.

AB Wetlands play a critical role in the global carbon (C) budget by sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2) and storing significant amounts of C, but climate change is altering C dynamics in these ecosystems. Therefore, predicting and mapping net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 in wetlands has emerged as a focus of research to better understand where, how, and when biogeochemical cycles will be modified by human and natural disturbances like climate change. To address this, we developed an object-based machine learning ensemble approach to upscale eddy covariance (EC) CO2 flux measurements across two major wetland ecosystems (cypress swamp and freshwater marshes) in the Greater Everglades of south Florida. We linked 30-m Landsat, water depth, and air temperature data with EC flux measurements using the temporally composite concept for model development, and mapped fluxes within Big Cypress National Preserve (BCNP) and Everglades National Park (ENP) to characterize two distinct seasonal flux patterns. Using an ensemble analysis of three machine learning model outputs (Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest), our models of NEE at BCNP had a high predictive power with a R-2 greater than 0.8, while NEE was predicted at ENP with a R-2 greater than 0.5. We also generated an uncertainty map to quantify the prediction diversity caused by application of multiple models in upscaling. This uncertainty map identifies regions that are either easy or challenging to predict from model based analyses. We conclude that integration of Landsat, water depth, and air temperature data is valuable for quantifying CO2 exchange between the atmosphere and Everglades ecosystems, and the developed paradigm is promising for upscaling EC flux measurements in wetlands to study and mitigate disturbances to wetland ecosystem services such as hurricanes, fires, water management and/or climate change.

AB Anthropogenic heat (AH) significantly impacts urban climates. Although combining the surface energy balance (SEB) with remote sensing data (RS-SEB) is promising for AH quantification, it has been shown to yield paradoxical low AH values in urban centers. Some speculation on the causes for the underestimation has appeared in the literature; however, none has been verified or thoroughly evaluated, largely hindering the further improvement of spatial representation of AH estimated through the RS-SEB approach. Here by casting the difference in the SEB between the observed reference state and a hypothetical scenario without AH, we developed a thermal stability analysis framework to identify the primary causes. Using AH estimations from six representative US cities based on Local Climate Zone (LCZ), we find that the reduced efficiency of the pathway from AH to sensible heat flux near high-rise buildings results in greater heat storage, which is a primary contributor to the underestimation. This study highlights the importance of heat storage in AH quantification using remote sensing data and provides evidence for potentially correcting the bias in AH with improved heat storage modeling.

AB After reflecting on the past decomposition studies using the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) technique and data in Earth observation (EO) studies, three primary issues are identified. Elements C-12 and C-32 of a covariance matrix, [C], are essential in the decomposition and cannot be ignored. Existing algorithms cannot adequately distinguish urban targets with large azimuth orientation angles from vegetation. The algorithms are complex in the formulation and procedure. To resolve the issues and envision future algorithm development, we have articulated three key modules. They are a separation factor to separate an azimuthally symmetric or asymmetric target, a diplane to model an asymmetric target in an urban area, and a procedure to derive an equivalent azimuth-orientation angle for the diplane. Then, a four-component decomposition algorithm was developed. The algorithm has been applied to multiple airborne and spaceborne PolSAR C- and L-band datasets covering areas in Canada, France, Morocco, and the USA. The primary radar target types included trihedral and dihedral corner reflectors (CRs), airport runway/taxiway, urban targets with azimuth-orientation angles ranging between 0 degrees and 45 degrees, ocean and inland water surfaces, city parks, grassland, forests, farmland, and desert. The separation factor delineates a symmetric or asymmetric target at a correct average rate of 92.7%. The diplane coupled with the derived equivalent azimuth-orientation angles correctly modeled radar backscatter from dihedral CRs and urban asymmetric targets. The algorithm delineated each type of ground target with an appropriate and dominant single, double, or volume scattering. Furthermore, the algorithm has four readily interpretable components, and its mathematical expression is not complicated. Therefore, the primary objectives to resolve the above three issues and to have an algorithm with well-balanced usability in EO studies and complexity in formulation and procedure are achieved.

AB Identifying the location of irrigated croplands and how they change over time is critical for assessing and managing limited water resources to navigate such challenges as local to global water scarcity, increasing demands for food and energy production, and environmental sustainability. Although efforts have been made to map irrigated area for the U.S., multi-year nationwide maps at field-relevant resolutions are still unavailable; existing products suffer from coarse resolution, uncertain accuracy, and/or limited spatial coverage, especially in the eastern U.S. In this study, we present an approach to map the extent of irrigated croplands across the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) for each year in the period of 1997-2017. To scale nationwide, we developed novel methods to generate training datasets covering both the western and eastern U.S. For the more arid western U.S., we built upon the methods of Xie et al. (2019) and further developed a greenness-based normalization technique to estimate optimal thresholds of crop greenness in any year based on those in USDA NASS census years (i.e., 1997, 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017). For the relatively humid eastern states, we collected data on the current status of center pivot irrigated and non-irrigated fields and extended these sample points through time using various indices and observational thresholds. We used the generated samples along with remote sensing features and environmental variables to train county-stratified random forest classifiers annually for pixel-level classification of irrigated extent each year and subsequently implemented a logic-based post-classification filtering. The produced Landsat-based Irrigation Dataset (LANID-US) accurately reconstructed NASS irrigation patterns at both the county and state level while also supplying new annual area estimates for intra-epoch years. Nationwide pixel-level locational assessment further demonstrated an overall accuracy above 90% across years. In the 21year study period, we found several hotspots of irrigation change including significant gains in the U.S. Midwest, the Mississippi River Alluvial Plain, and the East Coast as well as irrigation declines in the central and southern High Plains Aquifer and the southern California Central Valley, Arizona, and Florida. The resulting 30 m resolution LANID-US products represent the finest resolution account of nationwide irrigation use and dynamics across the United States to date. The developed approach, training data, and products are further extendable to other years (either before 1997 or after 2017) for continuous monitoring of irrigated area over CONUS and are spatially applicable to other regions with similar climate and cropping landscapes.

AB Monitoring ships at sea is of great importance for both civilian and military purposes. Since ship wakes are more distinct than hulls, wakes are widely employed for ship detection from satellite imagery. In this paper, a novel approach was proposed to detect ships from optical imagery. Candidate wakes were first obtained by the normalized Radon transform of an image with the ship hull in the center. False wakes were then removed by pixel value verification, turbulent wake identification, included angle verification, and contrast verification. Meanwhile, bright edges of turbulent wakes were detected after turbulent wake identification. Detected wakes were verified with wakes delineated through visual inspection. By implementing the proposed technique to optical imagery, reflectance at the near-infrared (NIR) band of GF 1 and Sentinel 2 MSI and the panchromatic band of Landsat 8 OLI showed the best accuracies. Total recalls of turbulent and Kelvin wakes were 93.5% and 91.2%, respectively, while total precisions were 93.7% and 93.8%, respectively. Positions, directions, and endpoints of wakes were also obtained with good accuracy. The categories of wakes were confirmed by the wake features and the spatial relationships between wakes. Factors influencing the accuracy of the developed method and comparison with state-of-the-art wake detection methods were then discussed.

AB The Antarctic ice sheet is an important mass of glacier ice. It is particularly sensitive to climate change, and the flow of Antarctica?s inland glaciers into the sea, accelerated by collapsing ice shelves, threatens global sea level rise. The amount of snowmelt on the surface of the ice sheet is an important metric for accurately assessing surface material loss and albedo change, which affect the stability of the ice sheet. This study proposes a framework for quickly extracting time-series freeze-thaw information at the continental scale and 40 m resolution by taking advantage of the huge amount of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired by Sentinel-1 satellites over the Antarctic, available for rapid processing on Google Earth Engine. Co-orbit normalization is used in the proposed framework to establish a unified standard of judgement by reducing the variations in the backscattering coefficient introduced by observation geometry, terrain fluctuations, and melt conditions between images acquired at different times. We implemented the framework to produce a massive dataset of both monthly freeze-thaw information over the Antarctic and higher temporal resolution freeze-thaw information for the Larsen C ice shelf from 2015 to 2019, with overall accuracies of 93% verified by a manual visual interpretation method and 84% evaluated from automatic weather station temperatures. Due to its effectiveness and robustness, the framework can be used to analyse the spatiotemporal distribution of snowmelt, the change in melt area, and anomalous melt events in Antarctica, especially those in Larsen C caused by foehn wind.

AB Much attention is paid to the estimation of forest biomass-related variables (stem volume and above-ground biomass) with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter images because of the increasing number of sensors in space providing global and repeated coverage and the sensitivity of the backscattered intensity to forest properties. One of the most popular models used to estimate a biomass-related variable from SAR backscatter observations is the Water Cloud Model (WCM) because of its simplicity allowing for a straightforward retrieval. Nonetheless, a common feature of these estimates is the tendency to over- or underestimate specific ranges due to simplifying assumptions in the model. In this study, the WCM has been revisited by exploring pathways for a physically-based, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-aided, model parameterization at larger scale with the overall aim to reduce systematic retrieval errors associated with empirical assumptions in the model. The study was undertaken in Sweden where repeated observations of backscatter by the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) were available. The integration was prototyped in Sweden thanks to detailed allometries relating forest variables in the WCM. These were derived from spatially dense estimates of canopy density and vegetation height from observations by the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) and measurements of height and stem volume from the Swedish National Forest Inventory (NFI). The SAR backscatter predicted by the revisited WCM was in strong agreement with the observations. When evaluated against stem volumes estimated from the NFI data, the SAR-based stem volumes presented strong dispersion at the pixel level. Average stem volume at the level of five or more pixels, i.e., for an area larger than 0.3 ha, were instead unbiased and similar to the average values obtained from the NFI data (relative root mean square error: 21.4%, estimation bias: 0.9 m(3)/ha and coefficient of determination: 0.67). This study demonstrates that the integration of allometries in the WCM effectively reduces estimation errors. The method here prototyped in Sweden qualifies to provide large-scale estimates of biomass-related variables using multiple observations of L-band backscatter with potential application worldwide.

AB Due to the complexity of land cover and aerosol types, the high-precision retrieval of land aerosol properties is challenging. A land general aerosol (LaGA) algorithm called the High-Precision Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (HiPARA) is proposed for the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) sensor over East Asia. In this algorithm, a monthly spectral base reflectance ratio library was constructed to obtain a pixel-by-pixel spectral reflectance relationship model. Statistical methods were used to obtain aerosol types in China, and a linearization scheme for the aerosol types was proposed based on sensitivity analysis. Based on these techniques, HiPARA achieved a completely dynamic determination of the surface reflectance and aerosol types. The new multiband aerosol characteristic retrieval strategy can return two parameters, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA). The AOD retrieved from HiPARA showed high consistency with AERONET AOD measurements, with correlation coefficients (R) of 0.939, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.082, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.113, ratios that meet an expected error (EE) of 0.825, and ratios that meet a Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) error of 0.339. Comparison of the HiPARA retrieved AOD with other operational aerosol products revealed that the accuracy of the HiPARA product was better than those of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) product (R < 0.9, RMSE > 0.175), Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) products (Dark Target (DT) algorithm, R = 0.907, RMSE = 0.203; Deep Blue (DB) algorithm, R = 0.909, RMSE = 0.139) and Visible/Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) AERDB product (R = 0.932, RMSE = 0.117). The HiPARA fitting line was close to 1:1 (i.e., y = x). The aerosol products were further evaluated for four extreme aerosol events: a smoke aerosol event, a haze aerosol event, a dust aerosol event, and a continuous aerosol variation event. Observation of the true-color images and AOD retrievals showed that the HiPARA AOD distribution matched the true-color images very well. The JAXA product had abnormal values and spatial discontinuities. The MODIS and VIIRS products were not as good as the HiPARA product in terms of spatial coverage. In the application to continuous monitoring of a dust event, the HiPARA AOD captured the variations in and intensity of the dust aerosols very well. These results suggested the robustness of HiPARA and its potential for monitoring extreme pollution events with high precision and high temporal resolution.

AB Over the past decade, sequential laser scanning has become increasingly routine for geomorphic monitoring in steep mountainous environments. Laser scans represent a permanent record of the terrain topology at a given point in time. Comparison of multitemporal datasets facilitates the identification of changes occurring in the terrain over time. Vegetation points in laser scans can inhibit the alignment of sequential scans.
   Therefore, vegetation points are commonly removed from the point cloud, although this can be a time-consuming process when done manually. In this study, an approach is presented and validated which makes use of multi-scale geometric operators to classify vegetation points in point clouds derived from terrestrial and aerial laser scanning. Using two study sites within the Thompson-Fraser rail corridor in British Columbia, Canada, the classification accuracies of vegetation points when compared to manual mapping was over 90%. The classified vegetation points are then segmented into individual trees. The approach is compared with outputs from the Find Individual Trees (FINT) program. The delineated trees from all approaches are incorporated into the RockyFor3D rockfall modelling program to show the implications of forest inventory construction from remote sensing methods on rockfall propagation. Over-classification of trees is shown to result in a higher predicted protective capacity of a forest when assessing a rockfall hazard.

AB Landslides represent one of the most damaging natural hazards and often lead to unexpected casualties and property damage. They also continually modify our natural environment and landscapes. Knowledge of landslide systems is largely restricted by the stochastic nature, subjective interpretation and infrequent or spatially sparse surveying of landslides. Characterized by persistent daily movements of a couple of centimeters over multi-centennial timescales and a long narrow shape as long as similar to 4 km, the Slumgullion landslide in Colorado, USA represents an ideal natural laboratory to study slow-moving landslides. Here we demonstrate the capability of the highly accurate, spatially continuous airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system of the NASA Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) to characterize the kinematic details of internal deformation of the Slumgullion landslide using SAR interferometry (InSAR). We develop a phase-based approach to automatically extract the boundaries of the mobile geological structures without unwrapping. Comparison with historic field observations from 1991 reveals the 40-m advance of the frontal toe and shift of an internal fault. The UAVSAR data also resolve an internal minislide (100 by 70 m), which moves more southerly than the main body at 5 mm/day in the lower part of the landslide. A Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) shows that the minislide is associated with the opening of a 30 by 10 m pull-apart basin and bounding strike-slip faults. These extensional structures, nearby incised streams, and steepened local slopes helped establish the kinematic environment for the formation of the secondary minislide. The disparity between the UAVSAR InSAR-derived horizontal moving directions and the LiDAR DEM-derived slope aspects suggest that while the surface topography governs the first-order orientation, the local kinematics is also subject to the variable nature of heterogeneous landslide materials and the irregular basal bedrock surface. The landslide velocity and precipitation show similar multi-annual variations. Our study demonstrates that the freely available, high-resolution UAVSAR data, have great potential for characterizing landslide kinematics and other small-scale geological and geomorphological processes.

AB The 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaikura earthquake represents an extremely complex event involving over ten major crustal faults, altering conventional understanding of multi-fault ruptures. Although evidence for coseismic slip on the Hikurangi subduction interface is controversial, we present afterslip on the subduction zone beneath Marlborough using 13 months of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) observations. The spatially and temporally correlated atmospheric errors in SAR interferograms are problematic, and hence a new InSAR time series approach, combining the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS) with a spatial-temporal Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) filter to facilitate the InSAR time series analysis, is developed. For interferograms with over 250 km spatial extent, we achieve a 0.77 cm displacement RMS difference against GPS, improving 61% from the conventional InSAR time series method (TS). Comparisons between the overlapping region of two independent tracks show an RMS difference of 1.1 cm for the TS-GACOS-APS combined method, improving 54% from the TS method and 27% from using TS with an APS filter only. The APS filter reduces the short wavelength residuals substantially, but fails to remove the long wavelength error even after the ramp removal, revealing that the GACOS correction has played a key role in mitigating long wavelength atmospheric effects. The resultant InSAR displacements, together with the GPS displacements, are used to recover the time-dependent afterslip distribution on the Hikurangi subduction in-terface, which provides insights for reviewing the co-seismic slip sources, the present status of the subduction plate boundary and future seismic hazards.

AB The satellite remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(lambda)) at two short blue bands (410 or 412 nm and 443 nm) are prone to large uncertainties in coastal and inland waters, prohibiting algorithms from generating reliable ocean color products associated with these bands. In this study, we developed an algorithm to estimate Rrs(41x) and Rrs (443) when the satellite Rrs(lambda) in blue bands suffer from large uncertainties. The algorithm first determines the Rrs(lambda) spectral shape from the satellite-measured Rrs(lambda) values at three wavelengths of 48x (486, 488, or 490), 55x (547, 551, or 555), and 67x (667, 670, or 671) nm. The algorithm then derives Rrs(41x) and Rrs(443) from the estimated Rrs(lambda) spectral shape with algebraic formulations. We assessed the algorithm performance with satellite (SeaWiFS, MODISA, and VIIRS-SNPP) and in situ Rrs(lambda) matchups from global waters. It is shown that the uncertainties of estimated Rrs(41x) and Rrs(443) are substantially smaller than the original satellite products when applicable. Besides, implementation of the algorithm contributes to a significant increase in the number of utilizable Rrs(41x) and Rrs(443) values. The algorithm is relatively stable and is best applicable to the satellite Rrs(lambda) spectra for which the Rrs(48x) and Rrs(55x) measurements are subject to small uncertainties. The demonstrations support the application of the blue-band estimation algorithm to a wide range of coastal waters.

AB Mapping and monitoring landslides in remote areas with steep and mountainous terrain is logistically challenging, expensive, and time consuming. Yet, in order to mitigate hazards and prevent loss of life in these areas, and to better understand landslide processes, high-resolution measurements of landslide activity are necessary. Satellite-based synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) provides millimeter-scale measurements of ground surface deformation that can be used to identify and monitor landslides in remote areas where ground based monitoring techniques are not feasible. Here we present a novel InSAR deformation detection approach, which uses double difference time-series with local and regional spatial filters and pixel clustering methods to identify and monitor slow-moving landslides without making a priori assumptions of the location of landslides. We apply our analysis to freely available Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellite data acquired between 2014 and 2017 centered on the Trishuli River drainage basin in Nepal. We found a minimum of 6 slow-moving landslides that all occur within the Ranimatta lithologic formation (phyllites, metasandstones, metabasics). These landslides have areas ranging from 0.39 to 1.66 km2 and long-term dry-season displacement rates ranging from 2.1 to 8.8 cm/yr. Due to periods of low coherence during the monsoon season (June - September) each year, and following the 25 April 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake, our time series analysis is limited to the 2014-2015 and 2016-2017 dry seasons (September-May). We found that each of the landslides displayed slightly higher rates during the 2014 period, likely as a result of higher cumulative rainfall that fell during the 2014 monsoon season. Although we do not have high quality InSAR data to show the landslide evolution directly following the Gorkha earthquake, the similar rates of movement before (2014-2015) and after (2016-2017) Gorkha suggest the earthquake had negligible long-term impact on these landslides. Our findings highlight the potential for region-wide mapping of slow-moving landslides using freely available remote sensing data in remote areas such as Nepal and future work will benefit from expanding our methodology to other regions around the world.

AB The prediction of carbon uptake by forests across fertility gradients requires accurate characterisation of how biochemical limitations to photosynthesis respond to variation in key elements such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Over the last decade, proxies for chlorophyll and photosynthetic activity have been extracted from hyperspectral imagery and used to predict important photosynthetic variables such as the maximal rate of carboxylation (V-cmax) and electron transport (J(max)). However, little research has investigated the generality of these relationships within the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limiting phases, which are characterised by mass based foliage ratios of N:P <= 10 for N limitations and N:P > 10 for P limitations.
   Using measurements obtained from one year old Pinus radiata D. Don grown under a factorial range of N and P treatments this research examined relationships between photosynthetic capacity (V-cmax, J(max)) and measured N, P and chlorophyll (Chl(a+b)). Using functional traits quantified from hyperspectral imagery we then examined the strength and generality of relationships between photosynthetic variables and Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) and chlorophyll a + b derived by radiative transfer model inversion.
   There were significant (P < .001) and strong relationships between photosynthetic variables and both N (R-2 = 0.82 for V-cmax; R-2 = 0.87 for J(max)) and Chl(a+b) (R-2 = 0.85 for V-cmax; R-2 = 0.86 for J(max)) within the N limiting phase that were weak (R-2 < 0.02) and insignificant within the P limiting phase. Similarly, there were significant (P < .05) positive relationships between P and photosynthetic variables (R-2 = 0.50 for V-cmax; R-2 = 0.58 for J(max)) within the P limiting phase that were insignificant and weak (R-2 < 0.33) within the N limiting phase.
   Predictions of photosynthetic variables using Chl(a+b) estimated by model inversion were significant (P < .001), positive and strong (R-2 = 0.64 for V-cmax; R-2 = 0.63 for J(max)) within the N limiting phase but insignificant and weak (R-2 < 0.05) within the P limiting phase. In contrast, both SIF and PRI exhibited moderate to strong positive correlations with photosynthetic variables within both the N and P limiting phases. These results suggest that quantified SIF and PRI from hyperspectral images may have greater generality in predicting biochemical limitations to photosynthesis than proxies for N and chlorophyll a + b, particularly under high foliage N content, when P is limiting.

AB Lichens dominate a significant part of the Earth's land surface, and are valuable bioindicators of various environmental changes. In the northern hemisphere, the largest lichen biomass is in the woodlands and heathlands of the boreal zone and in tundra. Despite the global coverage of lichens, there has been only limited research on their spectral properties in the context of remote sensing of the environment. In this paper, we report spectral properties of 12 common boreal lichen species. Measurements of reflectance spectra were made in laboratory conditions with a standard spectrometer (350-2500 nm) and a novel mobile hyperspectral camera (400-1000 nm) which was used in a multiangular setting. Our results show that interspecific differences in reflectance spectra were the most pronounced in the ultraviolet and visible spectral range, and that dry samples always had higher reflectance than fresh (moist) samples in the shortwave infrared region. All study species had higher reflectance in the backward scattering direction compared to nadir or forward scattering directions. Our results also reveal, for the first time, that there is large intraspecific variation in reflectance of lichen species. This emphasizes the importance of measuring several replicates of each species when analyzing lichen spectra. In addition, we used the data in a spectral clustering analysis to study the spectral similarity between samples and species, and how these similarities could be linked to different physical traits or phylogenetic closeness of the species. Overall, our results suggest that spectra of some lichen species with large ground coverage can be used for species identification from high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery. On the other hand, for lichen species growing as small assemblages, mobile hyperspectral cameras may offer a solution for in-situ species identification. The spectral library collected in this study is available in the SPECCHIO Spectral Information System.

AB Canopy nitrogen (N) influences carbon (C) uptake by vegetation through its important role in photosynthetic enzymes. Global Vegetation Models (GVMs) predict C assimilation, but are limited by a lack spatial canopy N input. Mapping canopy N has been done in various ecosystems using remote sensing (RS) products, but has rarely considered environmental variables as additional predictors. Our research objective was to estimate spatial patterns of canopy N in European forests and to investigate the degree to which including environmental variables among the predictors would improve the models compared to using remotely sensed products alone. The environmental variables included were climate, soil properties, altitude, N deposition and land cover, while the remote sensing products were vegetation indices and NIR reflectance from MODIS and MERIS sensors, the MOD13Q1 and MTCI products, respectively. The results showed that canopy N could be estimated both within and among forest types using the random forests technique and calibration data from ICP Forests with good accuracy (r(2) = 0.62, RRMSE = 0.18). The predicted spatial pattern shows higher canopy N in mid-western Europe and relatively lower values in both southern and northern Europe. For all subgroups tested (All plots, Evergreen Needleleaf Forest (ENF) plots and Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (DBF) plots), including environmental variables improved the predictions. Including environmental variables was especially important for the DBF plots, as the prediction model based on remotely sensed data products predicted canopy N with the lowest accuracy.

AB Timely and accurate delineation of the cropland extent over large area is crucial for operational agriculture monitoring and is also beneficial to address food security issues. Existing global datasets associated with cropland are limited by insufficient spatial resolution to properly represent areas with small parcel size distributions, and their less-than-ideal accuracies hamper application at regional and local scales. Diverse very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite systems are now available, offering sub-meter to five-meter resolution (e.g. Gaofen-1, Gaofen-2, and ZiYuan-3), and hence enabling explicit extraction of cropland areas from heterogeneous and fragmented landscapes. This study presented a generalized methodology for operational cropland mapping at very high resolution using a deep convolutional neural network to automatically learn the robust and discriminative features. Specifically, we slightly modified the pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) and combined deep long-range features with shadow local features to provide predictions with high level of detail. We demonstrated the modified PSPNet (MPSPNet) over four province-wide study areas (Heilongjiang, Hebei, Zhejiang and Guangdong) with diverse agrosystems across China from north to south using multi-source very high spatial resolution satellite images (mainly Gaofen-1 supplemented with Gaofen-2 and ZiYuan-3), with the overall accuracies ranging from 89.99% to 92.31%. Moreover, we compared MPSPNet with other CNN models and investigated the its behavior by visualizing the learned features on different layers, indicating that combining low and high level features for final classification was an efficient and accurate strategy for cropland mapping because the former capture edge information related to object boundaries and the latter could learn long-range spatial dependencies that helped recognize croplands. The temporal transfer and spatial transfer assessments from the respects of qualitative and quantitative corroborated the robust generalizability of the proposed method. And the contrast to the traditional object-based classification method also demonstrated the advantages and strong generalization capabilities of MPSPNet in extracting cropland using VHSR remote sensed images. We compared our results with the current cropland maps generated from FROM-GLC10, which further verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach for large-scale cropland mapping at very high resolution.

AB Shadows are prevalent in urban environments, introducing high uncertainties to fine-scale urban land-cover mapping. In this study, we developed a Recurrent Shadow Attention Model (RSAM), capitalizing on state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, to retrieve fine-scale land-cover classes within cast and self shadows along the urban-rural gradient. The RSAM differs from the other existing shadow removal models by progressively refining the shadow detection result with two attention-based interacting modules - Shadow Detection Module (SDM) and Shadow Classification Module (SCM). To facilitate model training and validation, we also created a Shadow Semantic Annotation Database (SSAD) using the 1 m resolution (National Agriculture Imagery Program) NAIP aerial imagery. The SSAD comprises 103 image patches (500 x 500 pixels each) containing various types of shadows and six major land-cover classes - building, tree, grass/shrub, road, water, and farmland. Our results show an overall accuracy of 90.6% and Kappa of 0.82 for RSAM to extract the six land-cover classes within shadows. The model performance was stable along the urban-rural gradient, although it was slightly better in rural areas than in urban centers or suburban neighborhoods. Findings suggest that RSAM is a robust solution to eliminate the effects in high-resolution mapping both from cast and self shadows that have not received equal attention in previous studies.

AB Nitrogen (N) is considered as one of the most important plant macronutrients and proper management of N therefore is a pre-requisite for modern agriculture. Continuous satellite-based monitoring of this key plant trait would help to understand individual crop N use efficiency and thus would enable site-specific N management. Since hyperspectral imaging sensors could provide detailed measurements of spectral signatures corresponding to the optical activity of chemical constituents, they have a theoretical advantage over multi-spectral sensing for the detection of crop N. The current study aims to provide a state-of-the-art overview of crop N retrieval methods from hyperspectral data in the agricultural sector and in the context of future satellite imaging spectroscopy missions. Over 400 studies were reviewed for this purpose, identifying those estimating mass-based N (N concentration, N%) and area-based N (N content, N-area) using hyperspectral remote sensing data. Retrieval methods of the 125 studies selected in this review can be grouped into: (1) parametric regression methods, (2) linear nonparametric regression methods or chemometrics, (3) nonlinear nonparametric regression methods or machine learning regression algorithms, (4) physically-based or radiative transfer models (RTM), (5) use of alternative data sources (sun-induced fluorescence, SIF) and (6) hybrid or combined techniques. Whereas in the last decades methods for estimation of Narea and N% from hyperspectral data have been mainly based on simple parametric regression algorithms, such as narrowband vegetation indices, there is an increasing trend of using machine learning, RTM and hybrid techniques. Within plants, N is invested in proteins and chlorophylls stored in the leaf cells, with the proteins being the major nitrogen-containing biochemical constituent. However, in most studies, the relationship between N and chlorophyll content was used to estimate crop N, focusing on the visible-near infrared (VNIR) spectral domains, and thus neglecting protein-related N and reallocation of nitrogen to non-photosynthetic compartments. Therefore, we recommend exploiting the estimation of nitrogen via the proxy of proteins using hyperspectral data and in particular the short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral domain. We further strongly encourage a standardization of nitrogen terminology, distinguishing between N% and Narea. Moreover, the exploitation of physically-based approaches is highly recommended combined with machine learning regression algorithms, which represents an interesting perspective for future research in view of new spaceborne imaging spectroscopy sensors.

AB The modeling of Near-Surface Temperature Lapse Rate (NSTLR) is of great importance in various environmental applications. This study proposed a new approach for modeling the NSTLR based on the Normalized Land Surface Temperature (NLST). A set of remote sensing imagery including Landsat images, MODIS products, and ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land cover maps, and climatic data recorded in meteorological stations and self-deployed devices located in the three study area were used for modeling and evaluation of NSTLR. First, the Split Window (SW) and Single Channel (SC) algorithms were used to estimate LST, and the spectral indices were used to model surface biophysical characteristics. The solar local incident angle was obtained based on topographic and time conditions for different dates. In the second step, the NSTLR value was calculated based on the LST-DEM feature space at the regional scale. The LST was normalized relative to the surface characteristics based on Random Forest (RF) regression and the NSTLR was calculated based on the NLST-DEM feature space. Finally, the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the modeled NSTLR and the observed NSTLR were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the modeled NSTLR. The mean values of R-2 between DEM and NLST were improved 0.3, 0.42 and 0.35, rather than between DEM and LST for the study area A, B and C, respectively. The R-2 and RMSE between the observed NSTLR and the Landsat derived NSTLR based on NLST for the study area A (B, C) were improved 0.30 (0.26, 0.35) and 0.81 (0.80, 0.94) degrees C Km(-1), respectively, rather than the Landsat derived NSTLR based on LST. Also, for the study area A, the R-2 and RMSE between the observed NSTLR and the MODIS derived NSTLR based on NLST in spring, summer, autumn and winter were improved 0.17, 0.12, 0.10, and 0.22; and 0.51, 0.44, 0.27, and 0.51 degrees C Km(-1), respectively, rather than the MODIS derived NSTLR based on LST. Model assessment results (R-2 and RMSE) and comparing modeled NSTLR (all strategies) with observed NSTLR, for both Landsat and MODIS, showed that the use of NLST instead of LST, significantly improved the accuracy of the obtained NSTLR in the mountainous regions.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) measured from space has been increasingly used to quantify plant photosynthesis at regional and global scales. Apparent canopy SIF yield (SIFyield apparent), determined by fluorescence yield (Phi(F)) and escaping ratio (f(esc)), together with absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), is crucial in driving spatio-temporal variability of SIF. While strong linkages between SIFyield apparent and plant physiological responses and canopy structure have been suggested, spatio-temporal variability of SIFyield apparent at regional scale remains largely unclear, which limits our understanding of the spatio-temporal variability of SIF and its relationship with photosynthesis. In this study, we utilized recent SIF data with high spatial resolution from two satellite instruments, OCO-2 and TROPOMI, together with multiple other datasets. We estimated SIFyield apparent across space, time, and different vegetation types in the U.S. Midwest during crop growing season (May to September) from 2015 to 2018. We found that SIFyield apparent of croplands was larger than non-croplands during peak season (July-August). However, SIFyield apparent between corn (C4 crop) and soybean (C3 crop) did not show a significant difference. SIFyield apparent of corn, soybean, forest, and grass/pasture show clear seasonal and spatial patterns. The spatial variability of precipitation during the growing season could explain the overall spatial pattern of SIFyield apparent. Further analysis by decomposing SIFyield apparent into Phi(F) and f(esc) using near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) suggests that fesc may be the major driver of the observed variability of SIFyield apparent.

AB Various forms of machine learning (ML) methods have historically played a valuable role in environmental remote sensing research. With an increasing amount of "big data" from earth observation and rapid advances in ML, increasing opportunities for novel methods have emerged to aid in earth environmental monitoring. Over the last decade, a typical and state-of-the-art ML framework named deep learning (DL), which is developed from the traditional neural network (NN), has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in performance. Substantial progress in developing a DL methodology for a variety of earth science applications has been observed. Therefore, this review will concentrate on the use of the traditional NN and DL methods to advance the environmental remote sensing process. First, the potential of DL in environmental remote sensing, including land cover mapping, environmental parameter retrieval, data fusion and downscaling, and information reconstruction and prediction, will be analyzed. A typical network structure will then be introduced. Afterward, the applications of DL environmental monitoring in the atmosphere, vegetation, hydrology, air and land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, solar radiation, and ocean color are specifically reviewed. Finally, challenges and future perspectives will be comprehensively analyzed and discussed.

AB Many studies have shown that high elevation environments are among very sensitive to climatic changes and where impacts are exacerbated. Across Central Asia, which is especially vulnerable to climate change due to aridity, the ability of global climate projections to capture the complex dynamics of mountainous environments is particularly limited. Over montane Central Asia, agropastoralism constitutes a major portion of the rural economy. Extensive herbaceous vegetation forms the basis of rural economies in Kyrgyzstan. Here we focus on snow cover seasonality and the effects of terrain on phenology in highland pastures using remote sensing data for 2001-2017. First, we describe the thermal regime of growing season using MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data, analyzing the modulation by elevation, slope, and aspect. We then characterized the phenology in highland pastures with metrics derived from modeling the land surface phenology using Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series together with MODIS LST data. Using rank correlations, we then analyzed the influence of four metrics of snow cover seasonality calculated from MODIS snow cover composites-first date of snow, late date of snow, duration of snow season, and the number of snow-covered dates (SCD)-on two key metrics of land surface phenology in the subsequent growing season, specifically, peak height (PH; the maximum modeled NDVI) and thermal time to peak (TTP; the amount of growing degree-days accumulated during modeled green-up phase). We evaluated the role of terrain features in shaping the relationships between snow cover metrics and land surface phenology metrics using exact multinomial tests of equivalence. Key findings include (1) a positive relationship between SCD and PH occurred in over 1664 km(2) at p < 0.01 and 5793 km(2) at p < 0.05, which account for > 8% of 68,881 km(2) of the pasturelands analyzed in Kyrgyzstan; (2) more negative than positive correlations were found between snow cover onset and PH, and more positive correlations were observed between snowmelt timing and PH, indicating that a longer snow season can positively influence PH; (3) significant negative correlations between TTP and SCD appeared in 1840 km(2) at p < 0.01 and 6208 km(2) at p < 0.05, and a comparable but smaller area showed negative correlations between TTP and last date of snow (1538 km(2) at p < 0.01 and 5188 km(2) at p < 0.05), indicating that under changing climatic conditions toward earlier spring warming, decreased duration of snow cover may lead to lower pasture productivity, thereby threatening the sustainability of montane agropastoralism; and (4) terrain had a stronger influence on the timing of last date of snow cover than on the number of snow-covered dates, with slope being more important than aspect, and the strongest effect appearing from the interaction of aspect and steeper slopes. In this study, we characterized the snow-phenology interactions in highland pastures and revealed strong dependencies of pasture phenology on timing of snowmelt and the number of snow-covered dates.

AB Water Surface Elevation (WSE) is an important hydrometric observation, useful to calibrate hydrological models, predict floods, and assess climate change. However, the number of in-situ gauging stations is in decline worldwide. Satellite altimetry, including the recently launched satellite missions (e.g. the radar altimetry missions Cryosat 2, Jason 3, Sentinel 3A/B and the LIDAR mission ICESat-2), can determine WSE only in rivers which are more than ca. 100 m wide. WSE measurements in small streams currently remain limited to the few existing in-situ stations or to time-consuming in-situ surveys. Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can acquire real-time WSE observations during periods of hydrological interest (but with flight limitations in extreme weather conditions), within short survey times and with automatic or semi-automatic flight operations. UAS-borne photogrammetry is a well-known technique that can estimate land elevation with an accuracy as high as a few cm, similarly UAS-borne LIDAR can estimate land elevation but without requiring Ground Control Points (GCPs). However, both techniques face limitations in estimating WSE: water transparency and lack of stable visual key points on the Water Surface (WS) complicate the UAS-borne photogrammetric estimates of WSE, while the LIDAR reflection from the water surface is generally not strong enough to be captured by most of the UAS-borne LIDAR systems currently available on the market. Thus, LIDAR and photogrammetry generally require extraction of the elevation of the "water-edge" points, i.e. points at the interface between land and water, for identifying the WSE. We demonstrate highly accurate WSE observations with a new radar altimetry solution, which comprises a 77 GHz radar chip with full waveform analysis and an accurate dual frequency differential Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) system. The radar altimetry solution shows the lowest standard deviation (sigma) and RMSE on WSE estimates, ca. 1.5 cm and ca. 3 cm respectively, whilst photogrammetry and LIDAR show a sigma and an RMSE at decimetre level. Radar altimetry also requires a significantly shorter survey and processing time compared to LIDAR and especially to photogrammetry.

AB Vegetation dynamics and phenology play an important role in inter-annual vegetation changes in terrestrial ecosystems and are key indicators of climate-vegetation interactions, land use/land cover changes and variation in year-to-year vegetation productivity. Satellite remote sensing data have been widely used for vegetation phenology monitoring over large geographic domains using various types of observations and methods over the past several decades. The goal of this paper is to present a detailed review of existing methods for phonology detection and emerging new techniques based on the analysis of time-series, multispectral remote sensing imagery. This paper summarizes the objective and applications of detecting general vegetation phenology stages (e.g., green onset, time or peak greenness and growing season length) often termed 'land surface phonology', as well as more advanced methods that estimate species-specific phonological stages (e.g., silking stage of maize). Common data processing methods, such as data smoothing, applied to prepare the time-series remote sensing observations to be applied to phenological detection methods are presented. Specific land surface phenology detection methods as well as species-specific phenology detection methods based on multispectral satellite data are then discussed. The impact of different error sources in the data on remote-sensing based phonology detection are also discussed in detail, as well as ways to reduce these uncertainties and errors. Joint analysis of multi-scale observations ranging from satellite to more recent ground-based sensors is helpful for us to understand satellite-based phenology detection mechanism and extent phenology detection to regional scale in the future. Finally, emerging opportunities to further advance remote sensing of phenology is presented that includes observations from Cubesats, near-surface observations such as PhenoCams and image data fusion techniques to improve the spatial resolution of time-series image data sets needed for phenological characterization.

AB A laboratory experiment is set up to study both surface and in-depth soil moisture content (SMC). For that purpose, an aquarium is filled successively with two soils, a clay loam and a sand. Reflectance spectra are acquired in the solar domain (400-2400 nm) on the soil surface using an ASD FieldSpec 3 HR spectroradiometer and in-depth through the aquarium glass wall using two hyperspectral cameras. Successive amounts of water ranging from low to heavy rainfall in a temperate region are uniformly poured into the aquarium. The MARMITforSMC method based on the MARMIT (MultilAyer Radiative Transfer Model for soil ref lecTance) model is applied to each reflectance spectrum to determine gravimetric SMC. In particular, vertical profiles of SMC are provided with unprecedented spatial accuracy (similar to 0.287 mm). The results are compared with volumetric SMC measured by two time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors. The in-depth SMC image produced on the sand shows lower values within the first 2 cm (5%) than below (17%). In contrast, the SMC image produced on the clay loam shows evenly distributed values whatever the position in the aquarium, even 1 h after moistening. The difference in grain size between the soils explains this result.

AB Drought indices based on thermal remote sensing have been developed and have merit for effective early warning of agricultural droughts, but approaches so far are relatively complex or sensitive to land surface temperature (LST) estimation uncertainties. Here, we propose the temperature rise index (TRI), a drought index that is comparatively robust and easy to calculate, as the anomaly of the intrinsic morning rise of LST. The underlying principle is that the rate of LST rise between 1.5 and 3.5 h after the sunrise is approximately linear and occurs more rapidly under dry conditions than under wet conditions over vegetated surfaces as a consequence of stomatal control. TRI during the growing seasons of 2010-2014 was calculated over the Australian wheatbelt from LST retrievals from the geostationary Multifunction Transport Satellite-2 (MTSAT-2) instrument. The calculated TRI was compared with indices based on precipitation integrated over 1-, 3- and 6-month time scales, on Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) soil moisture derived from passive microwave remote sensing, and on vegetation condition (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) derived from optical remote sensing. The various indices were also compared to annual wheat yield over large areas. The correlation coefficient between TRI and precipitation anomaly that serves as an operational drought index in Australia was above 0.6 in general with 3-month integrative time scale for precipitation. TRI produced spatiotemporal dryness patterns that were very similar to those in soil moisture, but with more detail due to its finer resolution. A time lag of > 1 month was found between TRI and observed vegetation condition, supporting the use of TRI in early warning. Among the compared drought indices, TRI explained the largest fraction (35%) of wheat yield variations. TRI correlations with wheat yields peaked higher and earlier by almost one month in comparison to other indices. We conclude that the thermal drought index proposed here shows considerable potential for use in drought early warning as an effective complement.

AB Traditionally the history of remote sensing began during the First World War when aerial photography became a valuable reconnaissance tool. However, moving back more than a thousand years, the real pioneers of remote observation were probably the Nasca, a pre-Hispanic civilization living in southern Peru, between 100BC and 700 AD. They used 'earth observation' as a mean of cultural expression drawing the geoglyphs (known as Nasca Lines) only visible from above. These drawings were made on flat desert surface of the Pampa by removing or clearing sand or stones, to create paths for ritual functions to please the gods and create harmonious relationships between man and environment. In this paper, the Nasca geoglyphs in Pampa de Atarco, are object of remote sensing based investigations with the twofold aim to identify and characterize them as well as to analyse and monitor their fragile state of conservation, threatened mainly by vandalism and off road vehicles. The approach herein proposed includes the integration and reuse of diverse remote sensing dataset, from multispectral satellite to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based ISAR data and close range photogrammetry. In particular, a multidate (2002-2013) very high resolution (VHR) optical satellite dataset has been processed in the spatial and temporal domain using textural indicators, including Skewness, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and automatic classification tools which allowed us to enhance the visibility of disturbance features and to automatically extract them. The best results in terms of enhancement and automatic extraction capability of disturbance features have been obtained by Skewness. Moreover, the reuse of UAV L SAR-based correlation map, available free of charge from NASA, provided useful information on the state of disturbance from 2013 to 2015, widening the observation time window of the VHR satellite data set from 2002 to 2013. Finally, the integrated use of satellite VHR data with UAV-based photographs and DTMs, processed using structure from motion (SfM), allowed us to characterize, identify and reconstruct the relative chronological sequence of geoglyphs thus providing new insights and opening new perspectives for archaeological studies.

AB Planted forests are a key component of sustainable forest management, as their fast-growing biomass can provide many important ecosystem goods and services essential to human well-being. Accurate estimation of forest biomass is important for global carbon accounting and afforestation policy making, yet saturated reflectance signals over vegetation and a shortage of cloud-free images during the growing season largely limit the utility of optical remote sensing for biomass estimation of planted forests in subtropical and tropical regions. Stand age is a crucial factor in determining forest growth and stand development but hasn't been widely used in remote sensing-based biomass estimation approaches. The main objective of this study was to investigate the applicability of an allometric analysis approach combined with Landsat-derived forest age structure to estimate stand biomass of fast-growing forest plantations in a subtropical landscape of China. We used the Vegetation Change Tracker (VCT) approach and Landsat time series data from 1986 to 2016 to detect annual stand-replacing disturbance and estimate forest stand age. Allometric equations and relative growth rate functions were combined to establish the linkage between tree biomass and forest stand age. We also modeled the spatial distribution of tree biomass using a conventional remote sensing (CRS) method that only utilizes spectral and textural variables and an extended CRS method that incorporates stand age (CRS_EX). We then compared the CRS and CRS_EX methods with the allometric analysis method to highlight the importance of stand age and post-disturbance forest regrowth for biomass estimation. The Landsat-derived disturbance history was significantly correlated with stand age (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 3.7 year, p < 0.01). The CRS_EX and allometric analysis methods substantially improved tree biomass estimates (R-CRS_EX(2) = 0.77, RMSECRS_Ex = 37.7 t/ha; R-Allometric(2) = 0.70, RMSEAllometric = 43.5 t/ha) compared to the CRS method (R-CRS( )2= 0.53, RMSE (CRS) = 54.38 t/ha). Tree biomass estimated from the allometric analysis method aligned better with the allometric growth curves, while CRS_EX and CRS methods both exhibited notable overestimation for young and mid-aged forests. This study suggests that allometric models have the potential to be applied in subtropical forest plantations through the use of the existing forest stand development knowledge and increasingly open access remote sensing data.

AB Information on wood properties is crucial in estimating wood quality and forest biomass and thus developing the precision and sustainability of forest management and use. However, wood properties are highly variable between and within trees due to the complexity of wood formation. Therefore, tree-specific field references and spatially transferable models are required to capture the variability of wood quality and forest biomass at multiple scales, entailing high-resolution terrestrial and aerial remote sensing methods. Here, we aimed at identifying select tree traits that indicate wood properties (i.e. wood quality indicators) with a combination of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) in an examination of 27 even-aged, managed Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands in southern Finland. We derived the wood quality indicators from tree models sampled systematically from TLS data and built prediction models with respect to individual crown features delineated from ALS data. The models were incapable of predicting explicit branching parameters (height of the lowest dead branch R-2 = 0.25, maximum branch diameter R-2 = 0.03) but were suited to predicting stem and crown dimensions from stand, tree, and competition factors (diameter at breast height and sawlog volume R 2 = 0.5, and live crown base height R-2 = 0.4). We were able to identify the effect of canopy closure on crown longevity and stem growth, which are pivotal to the variability of several wood properties in managed forests. We discussed how the fusions of high-resolution remote sensing methods may be used to enhance sustainable management and use of natural resources in the changing environment.

AB Monitoring small water bodies ( < 50 ha) is difficult due to their size, limiting accurate assessments of surface water (SW) resources required for agricultural production and watershed hydrology. In environments where livelihoods depend on surface-water storage (SWS) structures, satellite altimetry-derived water levels are often unavailable. Therefore, seasonal reservoirs require a robust and cost-effective approach for estimating SWS. To approximate SWS throughout a typical environmental setting where irrigation reservoirs are found, we investigate the utility of TanDEM-X digital elevation model (DEM) to extract bathymetry of seasonal reservoir structures. Empirically-derived SWS relationships are combined with estimates of SW area from radar and multisource optical satellites to illustrate the potential for rapid SWS estimation using satellite-based SW extent as input. Two application examples illustrate the approach: (i) estimating the maximum volume of water in a southern Indian river basin for two monsoon seasons; and (ii) a time-series analysis using a high-volume of satellite observations to show the cycle of water (inflow and outflow) at the reservoir scale. SWS volumes at water levels below 1.5 m were estimated within an absolute volume error range of 6-8%. This study illustrates the applicability and challenges of using satellite remote sensing observations to continuously monitor reservoir SWS. Despite the cloud independent capability for operational monitoring of SW area, Sentinel-1 data should be combined with frequent and high spatial resolution CubeSat observations for hydrometric monitoring of reservoirs to reduce observation errors. Furthermore, we highlight the multi-sensor approach (optical and radar) to achieve high spatio-temporal resolution monitoring of small reservoirs over large spatial scales.

AB The extensive existence of mixed pixels in satellite imagery is challenging for accurate land surface interpretation and parametric inversion. Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) addresses the issue by providing valuable sub-pixel information. However, it is affected by endmember variability exhibiting diverse spectral characteristics for the same endmember, inducing substantial uncertainties in model estimations. A number of approaches have been proposed to reduce the uncertainties, but theoretical explanations of how endmember variability affects model estimation and how these approaches perform successfully have not yet been derived. In this study, error propagation caused by endmember variability in linear SMA (LSMA) was investigated using theoretical analysis and simulation experiments. The major findings are as follows: (1) the impact of endmember variability on LSMA unmixing error depends on the interactions between deviation signal and gain vectors in a multiplicative way. (2) Unmixing error originates from the deviation signal that is governed jointly by spectral variability within an endmember class (i.e., intra-class variability) and endmember abundances, while spectra magnitude and spectral similarity among different endmember classes (i.e., inter-class variability) can amplify or reduce the deviation signal. (3) The typical approaches for mitigating endmember variability could not only change the deviation signal but also affect gain vectors, resulting in improved performance of LSMA to some extent. Based on these results, we recommend Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to be used in most applications considering its robustness in mitigating endmember variability. The results of this study will be of benefit to the application of LSMA in practice.

AB Over the last decade, a series of global moderate resolution leaf area index (LAI) products have become available and been widely applied in many disciplines. At the same time, there is an increasing demand for the uncertainties associated with these products, which has to be determined through rigorous validation studies. This study validated seven global LAI products - EPS, GEOV2, GLASS, GLOBMAP, MODIS, PROBA-V, and VIIRS - over typical agricultural croplands in northeastern China. Seasonal continuous LAI measurements were obtained from field campaigns in paddy rice fields in 2012 and 2013, and in maize, soybean, and sorghum fields in 2016. High resolution reference LAI maps were first derived from HJ-1, Landsat 7, and Sentinel-2A images with the look-up table (LUT) inversion method and were evaluated with the field measured LAI (R-2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 0.66). Subsequently, the moderate resolution LAI products were validated with the upscaled high resolution reference LAI.
   All LAI products show typical seasonal variation patterns of agricultural crops, but distinct differences exist among the products. The product quality indicators show large deviations during the peak growing season, whereas the relative uncertainties are higher during the green-up and senescent phases. Both EPS and GLASS show some saturation effects at LAI similar to 4.0 and underestimate the reference LAI (> 0.5), whereas GLOBMAP shows the largest overestimation (bias = 0.96). GEOV2 and PROBA-V significantly overestimate the LAI for all crops. In contrast, MODIS and VIIRS underestimate and show high variations (RMSE >1.50, RRMSE >47%) compared with the reference LAI. In general, the global moderate resolution LAI products show moderate agreement with the reference LAI (RMSE: 0.80-2.0 and RRMSE: 25-60%). The product uncertainties are higher over paddy rice fields than those over the other crop fields. The uncertainties are mainly attributed to the lack of regional tuning of the global algorithms for agricultural crops at different growth stages. Further algorithm improvement and validation studies are necessary to improve the global LAI products for regional applications.

AB Copernicus is the European Union's Earth Observation and Monitoring programme, delivering free access to operational and historical environmental data to support applications in a wide range of societal benefit areas. To allow meaningful long-term environmental monitoring and robust decision-making, it is essential to ensure that satellite-retrieved products are of high quality and consistency. This paper describes the outputs of an international workshop on the radiometric calibration validation of the Copernicus Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B Multi-Spectral Instrument. A wide range of vicarious methodologies have been applied independently and then compared per type of target. All methods agree on the good radiometric performance of both Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B with respect to the mission requirements as well as on evidence of a slight bias between the two instruments. Comparisons of all these results are discussed to highlight the benefits and advantages of the methods as well as to propose potential improvements either for the methods themselves and/or for the comparison exercise.

AB Sea-surface temperature (SST) was one of the first ocean variables to be studied from earth observation satellites. Pioneering images from infrared scanning radiometers revealed the complexity of the surface temperature fields, but these were derived from radiance measurements at orbital heights and included the effects of the intervening atmosphere. Corrections for the effects of the atmosphere to make quantitative estimates of the SST became possible when radiometers with multiple infrared channels were deployed in 1979. At the same time, imaging microwave radiometers with SST capabilities were also flown. Since then, SST has been derived from infrared and microwave radiometers on polar orbiting satellites and from infrared radiometers on geostationary spacecraft. As the performances of satellite radiometers and SST retrieval algorithms improved, accurate, global, high resolution, frequently sampled SST fields became fundamental to many research and operational activities. Here we provide an overview of the physics of the derivation of SST and the history of the development of satellite instruments over half a century. As demonstrated accuracies increased, they stimulated scientific research into the oceans, the coupled ocean-atmosphere system and the climate. We provide brief overviews of the development of some applications, including the feasibility of generating Climate Data Records. We summarize the important role of the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) in providing a forum for scientists and operational practitioners to discuss problems and results, and to help coordinate activities world-wide, including alignment of data formatting and protocols and research. The challenges of burgeoning data volumes, data distribution and analysis have benefited from simultaneous progress in computing power, high capacity storage, and communications over the Internet, so we summarize the development and current capabilities of data archives. We conclude with an outlook of developments anticipated in the next decade or so.

AB Carotenoid pigments play an important role in the seasonal regulation of photosynthesis and photoprotection of overwintering conifers. Because the seasonal changes in the rate of photosynthetic CO2 assimilation are linked to changes in carotenoid pigment composition, it has been suggested that carotenoid sensitive vegetation indices might be used to track the otherwise "invisible" phenology of photosynthesis of conifer forests through remote sensing of leaf spectral reflectance. In this study we aimed to assess differences in the seasonal regulation of photosynthesis and the associated variation of carotenoids and chlorophylls at the leaf-scale for eastern white pine, red maple and white oak, in order to understand if photosynthetic and photoprotective processes are adequately represented by different vegetation indices over the course of the year. For this purpose we measured maximum rates of CO2 assimilation (A(max)), quantified photosynthetic pigments, estimated photochemical and non-photochemical quenching processes via chlorophyll fluorescence and determined leaf spectral reflectance in pine, maple and oak trees over the course of two years. Seasonal variation in A(max), used here as a proxy for photosynthetic phenology, and photosynthetic pigments were adequately represented by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for the deciduous trees. For pine, NDVI overestimated photosynthetic activity for most of the year and was hence not able to represent photosynthetic phenology, due to the fact that needle chlorophyll content shows only little variation over the course of the year. By contrast, using the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and the chlorophyll/carotenoid index (CCI), which both detect variations in carotenoids, we were able to observe an improved representation of the seasonal variation of CO2 assimilation and photosynthetic phenology for the two deciduous and the conifer species. Based on the accurate detection of the seasonal regulation of leaf-scale photosynthetic activity for all three species, we conclude that carotenoid-sensitive vegetation indices are promising tools to improve monitoring of phenology in both deciduous and conifer forests.

AB The Earth surface thermal infrared (TIR) radiation shows conspicuously an anisotropic behavior just like the bidirectional reflectance of visible and near infrared spectral domains. The importance of thermal radiation directionality (TRD) is being more and more widely recognized in the applications because of the magnitude of the effects generated. The effects of TRD were originally evidenced through experiments in 1962, showing that two sensors simultaneously measuring temperature of the same scene may get significantly different values when the viewing geometry is different. Such effect limits inter-comparison of measurement datasets and land surface temperature (LST) products acquired at different view angles, while raising the question of measurement reliability when used to characterize land surface processes. These early experiments fostered the development of modeling approaches to quantify TRD with the aim of developing a correction for Earth surface TIR radiation. Initiatives for pushing the analysis of TIR data through modeling have been lasted since 1970s. They were initially aimed at mimicking the observed TIR radiance with consideration of canopy structure, component emissivities and temperatures, and Earth surface energy exchange processes. Presently, observing the Earth surface TRD effect is still a challenging task because the TIR status changes rapidly. Firstly, a brief theoretical background and the basic radiative transfer equation are presented. Then, this paper reviews the historical development and current status of observing TRD in the laboratory, in-situ, from airborne and space-borne platforms. Accordingly, the TRD model development, including radiative transfer models, geometric models, hybrid models, 3D models, and parametric models are reviewed for surfaces of water, ice and sea, snow, barren lands, vegetation and urban landscapes, respectively. Next, we introduce three potential applications, including normalizing the LST products, estimating the hemispheric upward longwave radiation using multi-angular TIR observations and separating surface component temperatures. Finally, we give hints and directions for future research work. The last section summarizes the study and stresses three main conclusions.

AB With 37 million inhabitants, Tokyo is the world's largest city in UN statistics. With this work we call this ranking into question. Usually, global city rankings are based on nationally collected population figures, which rely on administrative units. Sprawling urban growth, however, leads to morphological city extents that may surpass conventional administrative units. In order to detect spatial discrepancies between the physical and the administrative city, we present a methodology for delimiting Morphological Urban Areas (MUAs). We understand MUAs as a territorially contiguous settlement area that can be distinguished from low-density peripheral and rural hinterlands. We design a settlement index composed of three indicators (settlement area, settlement area proportion and density within the settlements) describing a gradient of built-up density from the urban center to the periphery applying a sectoral monocentric city model. We assume that the urban-rural transition can be defined along this gradient. With it, we re-territorialize the conventional administrative units. Our data basis are recent mapping products derived from multi-sensoral Earth observation (EO) data namely the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) and the GUF Density (GUF-DenS) - providing globally consistent knowledge about settlement locations and densities. For the re-territorialized MUAs we calculate population numbers using WorldPop data. Overall, we cover the 1692 cities with > 300,000 inhabitants on our planet. In our results we compare the consistently re-territorialized MUAs and the administrative units as well as their related population figures. We find the MUA in the Pearl River Delta the largest morphologically contiguous urban agglomeration in the world with a calculated population of 42.6 million. Tokyo, in this new list ranked number 2, loses its top position. In rank-size distributions we present the resulting deviations from previous city rankings. Although many MUAs outperform administrative units by area, we find that, contrary to what we assumed, in most cases MUAs are considerably smaller than administrative units. Only in Europe we find MUAs largely outweighing administrative units in extent.

AB Twenty-five years ago, the two flights of the SIR-C/X-SAR Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system on the Space Shuttle Endeavour blazed a trail towards the future with a series of radar system innovations - that nearly every spaceborne SAR flown since then has benefited from, and in some cases improved upon. Many of the SAR techniques adopted by SAR system designers worldwide as part of their toolkit, such as: ScanSAR, Spotlight mode, along-track interferometry, polarization diversity and polarimetry, polarimetric calibration, variable length and bandwidth pulses, and on-board processing, can trace their heritage back to this first-of-a-kind, civil use SAR system. The electronic steering capability of SIR-C's phased array antenna, combined with the exquisite orbit track control provided by the Space Shuttle, paved the way for systematic mapping of the Earth's topography by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, and later by TanDEM-X. Some techniques, such as multi frequency SAR, multi-frequency repeat-pass interferometry and onboard processing have yet to be fully exploited. The richness of the SIR-C/X-SAR data set has proved to be a treasure trove for opening up entirely new remote sensing techniques, such as Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (or PoIInSAR), and GPS, now GNSS, reflections (also known as Signals of Opportunity), which were both demonstrated from archive data, years after the 1994 flights. The ground-breaking legacy of SIR-C/X-SAR lives on in the many SAR systems collecting data in Earth orbit today, and in those planned for the future.

AB The temporal variation of glacier mass balance during recent years remains poorly known for the mountain glaciers in the inner Tibetan Plateau (ITP), due to the lack of field measurements. In this study, we retrieved the annual glacier mass balance of the Puruogangri ice field, which is the largest modern ice mass in the ITP, by differencing multi-temporal digital elevation models (DEMs) generated with five pairs of TanDEM-X bistatic interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) images acquired between April 2011 and January 2016. We compared the TanDEM-X DEMs in January and April 2012 to estimate the X-band radar penetration depth difference (0.61 +/- 0.06 m), which enabled systematic bias correction in the estimation of annual glacier mass balance. The observed mass balance reveals a glacier mass gain of 0.44 +/- 0.10 m w.e. yr(-1) in 2011-12, which was followed by accelerated glacier mass loss in 2012-16. Glacier mass balances of -0.13 +/- 0.03, -0.34 +/- 0.06, and -0.52 +/- 0.10 m w.e. yr(-1) were estimated for the periods of 2012-13, 2013-14, and 2014-16, respectively. This accelerating trend of glacier mass loss is likely caused by the continuous decrease in annual precipitation, according to the climate data recorded by adjacent meteorological stations. This study demonstrates that repeated bistatic InSAR measurement is a promising method for monitoring glacier elevation change and mass balance at regular intervals.

AB Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is closely related to the atmospheric environment and human life. Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have been widely applied in estimating daily PM2.5 concentrations over large areas using statistical regression models. However, they are often given at coarse spatial resolutions which limit their applications in small or medium scales. This study aims to produce PM2.5 concentrations at a high spatial resolution (1 km) across China based on the newly released Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD1S) Collection 6 Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD product using a newly developed space-time random forest (STRF) model. Daily PM2.5 concentrations for 2016 were estimated from in-situ surface PM2.5 measurements, and meteorological and ancillary variables. The 10-fold cross-validation (CV) approach and three popular models, including the multiple linear regression model, the geographically weighted regression model, and the two-stage model, are employed for validation and cross comparison. A sample-based CV of the STRF model shows a high and stable accuracy with a coefficient of determination equal to 0.85, a root-mean-square error of 15.57 mu g m(-3), and a mean prediction error of 9.77 mu g m(-3). This finding suggests that the STRF model can predict PM2.5 daily, monthly, and annual concentrations at an unprecedented spatial resolution and accuracy across China. It also appears to have out-performed the above popular models and the previous related studies. In general, the STRF model is robust and can accurately estimate PM2.5 concentrations by taking advantage of the ensemble regression approach, the synergy of space-time information, and the high-resolution, high-quality, and wide-spatial-coverage of the MAIAC AOD product. It may thus also be useful for applications in related air pollution studies, especially those focused on urban areas.

AB Numerous algorithms have been developed to retrieve chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations (mg m(-3)) from Earth observation (EO) data collected over optically complex waters. Retrieval accuracy is highly variable and often unsatisfactory where Chla co-occurs with other optically active constituents. Furthermore, the applicability and limitations of retrieval algorithms across different optical complex systems in space and time are often not considered. In the first instance, this paper provides an extensive performance assessment for 48 Chla retrieval algorithms of varying architectural design. The algorithms are tested in their original parametrisations and are then retuned using in-situ remote sensing reflectance (R-rs(lambda), sr(-1)) data (n = 2807) collected from 185 global inland and coastal aquatic systems encompassing 13 different optical water types (OWTs). The paper then demonstrates retrieval performance across the full dataset of observations and within individual OWTs to determine the most effective model(s) of those tested for retrieving Chla in waters with varying optical properties. The results revealed significant variability in retrieval performance when comparing model outputs to in-situ measured Chla for the full in-situ dataset in its entirety and within the 13 distinct OWTs. Importantly, retuning an algorithm to optimise its parameterisation for each individual OWT (i.e. one algorithm, multiple parameterisations) is found to improve the retrieval of Chla overall compared to simply calibrating the same algorithm using the complete in-situ dataset (i.e. one algorithm, one parameterisation). This resulted in a 25% improvement in retrieval accuracy based on relative percentage difference errors for the best performing Chla algorithm. Improved performance is further achieved by allowing model type and specific parameterisation to vary across OWTs (i.e. multiple algorithms, multiple parameterisations). This adaptive framework for the dynamic selection of in-water algorithms is shown to provide overall improvement in Chla retrieval across a continuum of bio-geo-optical conditions. The final dynamic ensemble algorithm produces estimates of (log(10)-transformed) Chla with a correlation coefficient of 0.89 and a mean absolute error of 0.18 mg m(-3). The OWT framework presented in this study demonstrates a unified approach by bringing together an ensemble of algorithms for the monitoring of inland waters at a global scale from space.

AB A new physically based method to estimate hemispheric-directional reflectance factor (HDRF) from lightweight multispectral cameras that have a downwelling irradiance sensor is presented. It combines radiometry wilh photogrammetric computer vision to derive geometrically and radiometrically accurate data purely from the images, without requiring reflectance targets or any other additional information apart from the imagery. The sky sensor orientation is initially computed using photogrammetric computer vision and revised with a non linear regression comprising radiometric and photogrammetry-derived information. It works for both clear sky and overcast conditions. A ground-based test acquisition of a Spectralon target observed from different viewing directions and with different sun positions using a typical multispectral sensor configuration for clear sky and overcast showed that both the overall value and the directionality of the reflectance factor as reported in the literature were well retrieved. An RMSE of 3% for clear sky and up to 5 for overcast sky was observed.

AB Landuse characterization is important for urban planning. It is traditionally performed with field surveys or manual photo interpretation, two practices that are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, we aim to automate landuse mapping at the urban-object level with a deep learning approach based on data from multiple sources (or modalities). We consider two image modalities: overhead imagery from Google Maps and ensembles of ground-based pictures (side-views) per urban-object from Google Street View (GSV). These modalities bring complementary visual information pertaining to the urban-objects. We propose an end-to-end trainable model, which uses OpenStreetMap annotations as labels. The model can accommodate a variable number of GSV pictures for the ground-based branch and can also function in the absence of ground pictures at prediction time. We test the effectiveness of our model over the area of Ile-de-France, France, and test its generalization abilities on a set of urban-objects from the city of Nantes, France. Our proposed multimodal Convolutional Neural Network achieves considerably higher-accuracies than methods that use a single image modality, making it suitable for automatic landuse map updates. Additionally, our approach could be easily scaled to multiple cities, because it is based on data sources available for many cities worldwide.

AB The Simplified Level 2 Product Prototype Processor (SL2P) for estimating Leaf Area index (LAI), fraction of vegetation cover (fCover) and Canopy Water Content (CWC) from Sentinel-2/MSI and Landsat-8/OLI data was validated over an agricultural region. In-situ data collected during the SMAP Validation Experiment 2016 field campaign were used as a reference. SL2P processor performance varied substantially between crop type and biophysical variable. Over all crops, SL2P underestimated in-situ LAI and CWC measurements when using either MSI (slope (bias) of 0.70 (- 0.37) for LAI and 0.42 (- 0.37 kg/m(2)) for CWC) or OLI (slope (bias) of 0.59 (-1.21) for LAI and 0.24 (- 0.23 kg/m (2)) for CWC) data. The accuracy of SL2P fCover estimates, over all crops, was higher (slope (bias) of 0.99 (1.84%) using MSI and 0.93 (- 3.75%) using OLI). The RMSE between biophysical variables estimated using SL2P from MSI (OLI) in comparison to in-situ data was 0.98 (1.63) for LAI, 11.39% (10.95%) for fCover and 0.66 kg/m(2) (0.96 kg/m (2)) for CWC. Slightly better results are generally obtained using locally calibrated vegetation indices models, when compared to SL2P estimates using the corresponding sensor data. Uncertainty metrics of vegetation biophysical variables derived from both MSI and OLI, when compared to interpolated in-situ data time series, are found comparable to results obtained for cross-validation suggesting the possibility of using interpolated in-situ data time series for validating decametric resolution remote sensing products sparsely sampled in time.

AB Hydrodynamic modeling is an essential tool to simulate water level for flood forecasting and risk assessment. However, parameterization of hydrodynamic models is challenging due to poor knowledge of bathymetry and lack of gauge data. In this study, we present an approach for calibrating spatially distributed Strickler coefficient and river datum simultaneously by regularized inversion. Calibration was carried out using altimetry derived observations of water surface elevation in the Songhua River (China). Synthetic experiments show that spatial variability of model parameters can be well constrained by geodetic altimetry, e.g., CryoSat-2 and SARAL, and to a lesser extent by Envisat and Jason-1. However, Jason-2 can only recover some of the parameters. We also find that a higher accuracy of observations does not proportionally decrease parameter uncertainty for all cross sections. Instead, high spatial sampling density helps to identify the spatial variability of parameters. Real-world calibrations indicate that CryoSat-2 by far outperforms other altimeters in terms of parameter identification. We conclude that high spatial resolution is more important than temporal resolution and observation accuracy for calibrating parameters of large-scale river models. The findings demonstrate the added value of geodetic satellite altimetry for inversion of spatially resolved parameter fields. This study is timely because the upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission will significantly improve spatial and temporal resolution of spaceborne observations of water surface elevation, and hydraulic models need to be prepared for the uptake of these data.

AB This paper presents a framework for assessing the physical consistency between time-series of several satellite-based surface albedo and burned area products at global scale. The methodology evaluates the level of agreement of temporal change between these two Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) taking into account their uncertainties. Several configurations of surface albedo and burned area products, including the ones from MODIS Collection 6, Copernicus Global Land Service (C-GLS), Climate Change Initiative (CCI) and the GlobAlbedo, were analysed over the 2005-2011 period at 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees spatial resolution. The study evaluates the temporal and spatial coherence level in the ECV changes, and explores the product dependency impact on the fire-driven radiative forcings. The main findings indicate that the level of agreement between these two ECVs depends on the product combination but also on the albedo broadband. Whereas both GlobAlbedo and MODIS albedo changes are consistent both temporally and spatially when combined with any burned area product, the C-GLS albedo changes are characterised by lower levels of agreement. The results also indicate that surface albedo and burned area product changes are physically coherent for all biomes except grasslands and croplands, when using the MODIS burned area product. Using different combinations of burned area and surface albedo products, fire-induced radiative forcing estimates at the surface can differ, according to the biome, by 26% to 46%. The proposed framework identifies lack of coherency and consistency between the two ECVs. This novel approach allows us to address cross-ECV compatibility, and as such offers a valuable toolset to users.

AB The anisotropic scattering behavior of land surface is characterized by its bidirectional reflectance-distribution function (BRDF). However, a physically consistent BRDF definition is still lacking for heterogeneous and rugged terrain that accounts for approximately 24% of Earth's land surface. In this study, we revisited current BRDF definitions and updated them for rugged terrain with few dependent parameters: illumination and viewing geometries, terrain shadows, effective areas of illumination and observation, and anisotropic reflectance properties of subpixel-scale slopes. Furthermore, the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF), hemispherical-directional reflectance factor (HDRF), directional-hemispheric reflectance (DHR), and bi-hemispherical reflectance (BHR) were proposed within the current physical framework of reflectance quantities. These reflectance quantities have been adopted by the 3-D Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to provide the simulations of remote sensing images. To highlight the importance of a proper usage of such reflectance terms, we used DART simulations to present the topographic effects on these reflectance quantities. Finally, the other issues with respect to surface BRDF/BRF, such as spatial scale of rugged terrain, characterization of anisotropic reflectance of micro-scale surfaces, derivative reflectance quantities, topographic parameters, wavelength dependence and reciprocity, and future perspective were discussed.

AB Rivers and other freshwater systems play a crucial role in ecosystems, industry, transportation and agriculture. Despite the > 40 years of inland water observations made possible by optical remote sensing, a standardized reflectance product for inland waters is yet forthcoming. The aim of this work is to compare the standard USGS land surface reflectance product to two Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 aquatic remote sensing reflectance products over the Amazon, Columbia and Mississippi rivers. Landsat-8 reflectance products from all three routines are then evaluated for their comparative performance in retrieving chlorophyll-a and turbidity in reference to ship borne, underway in situ validation measurements. The land surface product shows the best agreement (4% Mean Absolute Percent Difference) with field measurements of radiometry collected on the Amazon River and generates 36% higher reflectance values in the visible bands compared to aquatic methods (ACOLITE and SeaDAS) with larger differences between land and aquatic products observed in Sentinel-2 (0.01 sr(-1)) compared to Landsat-8 (0.001 sr(-1)). Choice of atmospheric correction routine can bias Landsat-8 retrievals of chlorophyll-a and turbidity by as much as 59% and 35% respectively. Using a more restrictive time window for matching in situ and satellite imagery can reduce differences by 5-31% depending on correction technique. This work highlights the challenges of satellite retrievals over rivers and underscores the need for future optical and biogeochemical research aimed at improving our understanding of the absorbing and scattering properties of river water and their relationships to remote sensing reflectance.

AB A new approach is proposed in this study to maximize the skill of satellite altimeter-derived heights by utilizing river extent information from additional sensors. We apply this approach for JASON-3 nadir altimeter. First, locations were identified in South and South East Asia region as potential candidates for this approach based on river extent. Information on river extent composed of river width and course (i.e., path) from visible (Landsat) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) platform (Sentinel-1). The extent-based approach was applied to filter out non-water radar returns in two methods: 1) River Mask (RM) based K-means (KM) clustering (hence, RM + KM) and 2) K-means clustering embedded with River Mask (RM) (hence, KMRM). Both methods were validated over 12 locations with long records of in-situ height observations and with distinct river characteristics. The maximum benefit observed in utilizing dynamic river mask is during low flow season when the probability of non water radar signal contamination is highest. For highly varying seasonal widths, satellite imagery on river conditions, as an ensemble of techniques, yields heights with higher accuracy. An average RMSE improvement of 40% in 8 out of 12 stations is observed. Overall, at least one of the two dynamic mask-based techniques studied consistently outperformed the conventional technique of altimeter height extraction based on a fixed river mask. Information on river mask or extent can play an important role in highly meandering rivers as the deviation between actual satellite altimeter passes and nominal passes can be considered during the extraction of heights. Compared to visible (Landsat) imagery, SAR was found to be much more effective at improving altimeter height extraction because of the all-weather capability during frequently cloudy conditions. The practicality of the river mask-based approach for altimeter height extraction needs to be carefully considered by the operational end user based on available computational resources and the latency that can be afforded. An ensemble of morphology based techniques using SAR imagery is likely the future of satellite altimeter-based river height extraction in South and South-East Asia where rivers are increasingly impacted by human regulation, encroachment and seasonality.

AB Since 2009, the Guobu landslide has been very active, posing a safety threat to the Laxiwa Hydropower Station, located only several hundred meters downstream along the upper Yellow River in China. To investigate the current state of this landslide, we analyzed two stacks of X-band TerraSAR-X (TSX) High-resolution Spotlight (HS) mode images acquired from September 2015 to April 2017 in descending orbits with different look angles. A new time-series point-like target offset tracking (TS-PTOT) method is proposed to retrieve time-series surface displacements at point-like targets (PTs) from SAR image pairs properly combined with large temporal baselines and small spatial baselines. According to an evaluation of the standard deviation of time-series displacements at stable points, the TS-PTOT method increased the measurement precision of offset tracking by about 25% over the results using a single master. Our TSX-HS TS-PTOT results manifested a spatial pattern and magnitude of displacements highly similar to DInSAR result produced with an ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 image pair. The maximum displacement rate at the upper part of the slope during the study period was around 80 cm/yr in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction, which is much lower than the displacement rate measured in 2010. Furthermore, three-dimensional (3D) displacements at those identified homologous PTs were estimated by combining two-dimensional (2D) displacements measured by TS-PTOT from the two SAR data stacks. The 3D deformation pattern of the Guobu landslide properly verified its toppling-sliding deformation mechanism.

AB Kelp forests are highly productive and diverse coastal marine ecosystems which have high variability in extent and biomass spatially and through time. Mapping and monitoring their distribution is integral to understanding the ecology of kelp forests and to inform marine protected area planning. Canada's Pacific coast presents specific challenges to mapping canopy forming kelp with thousands of kilometers of coastline, complex topography, and a large tidal range. While in situ methods and manual interpretation of aerial photography are commonly used to map canopy-forming kelp at local or regional scales, these methods are prohibitively expensive for continued large-area application. Historical and current available inventories of kelp extent are therefore incomplete for Canada's Pacific Coast. The advent of Google Earth Engine, a cloud-computing platform with a repository of Landsat imagery, provides an opportunity to apply Landsat image archive analyses and integrate temporal compositing and filtering to obtain unprecedented data on historical and current kelp extents. However, the effects of the spatial resolution and temporal coverage for mapping canopy-forming kelp in regions with complex coastlines and large tidal ranges are unknown. The objectives of this study were twofold: (1) develop a tool within Google Earth Engine to automate the detection of kelp using the Landsat satellite image archive, and (2) quantify the associated limitations for mapping the surface extent of canopy-forming kelp by comparing Landsat derived kelp extent with extents derived from WorldView-2 satellite imagery. The results indicate that the overall accuracy of the developed method is high at 80% and very close in accuracy to WorldView-2 data, but no detection is feasible within approximately one 30 m pixel from the shoreline. The interaction between the spatial resolution, kelp bed size, and bed configuration affected the detected kelp extent, as did the tide level during image acquisition. For both sensors, a 2 m increase in tide resulted in a 40% decrease in kelp extent detected. The Google Earth Engine kelp mapping tool presented provides an efficient and transferable method for mapping canopy kelp extent, and the only currently available method to reconstruct coast wide kelp development for the past three decades. The presented tool has applications in conservation and management planning, for example in creating a baseline of past kelp extent and examining trends in kelp forest variability.

AB Sentinel-2 and Landsat data products when combined open opportunities for capturing the dynamics of near shore coastal and inland waters at rates that have never been possible before. Recognizing the differences in their spectral and spatial sampling, to generate a seamless data record for global water quality monitoring, it is critical to quantify how well the derived data products agree under various atmospheric and aquatic conditions. This study provides an extensive quantitative assessment of how Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/B equivalent data products compare and discusses implications on differences in downstream products generated via the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS). These products include the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance (rho(t)), the remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs), as well as biogeochemical properties, such as the total suspended solids (TSS). The analyses are conducted a) for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/B near-simultaneous nadir overpasses (n-SNO) and b) over several highly turbid/eutrophic inland/nearshore waters. Following the implementation of vicarious gains for Sentinel-2A, the n-SNO analyses indicated that Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A agree within +/- 1% in p, and +/- 5% in R-rs products across the visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands. Similar evaluations with preliminary vicarious gains for Sentinel-2B showed +/- 2% in rho(t) and 7% in R-rs products. Considering Landsat-8-derived R-rs products as a reference, we found < 5% difference in Sentinel-2A and -2B R-rs products. Analyses of combined TSS and R-rs time-series products over several aquatic systems further corroborated these results and demonstrated the remarkable value of combined products. Occasional negative retrievals of R-rs products over hypereutrophic and highly turbid waters suggest the need for improvements in the atmospheric correction procedure to empower science/application community to fully explore Landsat-Sentinel-2 products. With very similar absolute radiometric observations and products, the science community should consider developments of suitable biogeochemical algorithms to maximize the utility of merged Landsat-Sentinel-2 products.

AB Satellite salinity from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and in situ observations are used to diagnose the source of a significant increase in warm and salty surface water entering the Gulf of Maine (GoM) in the winter of 2017-2018. SMAP salinity anomaly data indicate that this event was related to a salty feature that moved along the northwestern Atlantic shelf break from near the Grand Banks southwest towards the GoM over eight months before entering the Gulf in December 2017 to January 2018. Satellite altimetry, sea surface salinity, and sea surface temperature data suggest that, before entering the GoM, the salty feature interacted with Gulf Stream meanders and eddies several times, helping to sustain the water mass. It is likely that feature interactions with a warm Gulf Stream meander took place in the fall of 2017, helping to advect high salinity water onto the shelf and then into the GoM as a surface trapped feature in late fall 2017. According to satellite salinity data, this episode led to significant salinification (about 1 psu) in the northeastern GoM. Interior GoM buoy salinity data agree in showing four months of increased GoM salinity of the upper 50 m starting in November 2017. Buoy T/S analyses characterize this surface inflow as modified warm Atlantic slope water, typically seen only below 100 m and previously unobserved at the surface in the 15-year buoy record. This new salty water circulated cyclonically along the GoM coastline and mixed into the deeper Gulf through February 2018. Its intrusion may have also enhanced the cyclonic winter circulation in the Gulf. GoM surface salinity anomalies ended abruptly in early March 2018 coincident with the occurrence of a bomb cyclone and its associated strong upper ocean mixing.

AB Eutrophication of inland waters is considered a serious global environmental problem. Satellite remote sensing (RS) has been established as an important source of information to determine the trophic state of inland waters through the retrieval of optically active water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). However, the use of RS techniques for assessment of the trophic state of inland waters on a global scale is hindered by the performance of retrieval algorithms over highly dynamic and complex optical properties that characterize many of these systems. In this study, we developed a new RS approach to assess the trophic state of global inland water bodies based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery and the Forel-Ule index (FUI). First, the FIJI was calculated from MODIS data by dividing natural water colour into 21 indices from dark blue to yellowish-brown. Then the relationship between FIJI and the trophic state index (TSI) was established based on in-situ measurements and MODIS products. The water-leaving reflectance at 645 nm band was employed to distinguish coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM)-dominated systems in the FIJI-based trophic state assessment. Based on the analysis, the FUI-based trophic state assessment method was developed and applied to assess the trophic states of 2058 large inland water bodies (surface area > 25 km(2)) distributed around the world using MODIS data from the austral and boreal summers of 2012. Our results showed that FUI can be retrieved from MODIS with a considerable accuracy (92.5%, R-2 = 0.92) by comparing with concurrent in situ measurements over a wide range of lakes, and the overall accuracy of the FIJI-based trophic state assessment method is 80.0% (R-2 = 0.75) validated by an independent dataset. Of the global large water bodies considered, oligotrophic large lakes were found to be concentrated in plateau regions in central Asia and southern South America, while eutrophic large lakes were concentrated in central Africa, eastern Asia, and mid-northern and southeast North America.

AB Surface temperature is a valuable metric for many Earth monitoring applications, which motivated the development of the Landsat Surface Temperature (LST) product. The initial LST algorithm, developed by Cook, was geographically restricted since the atmospheric inputs and truth data were limited to North America (Cook, 2014. Atmospheric Compensation for a Landsat Land Surface Temperature Product. Rochester Institute of Technology). The main objectives for this product are to produce an LST image for every available Landsat thermal image, and to also provide a per-pixel estimate of LST uncertainty. Various studies were performed in order to allow the LST algorithm to operate globally, after which a thorough global validation study was performed for Landsat 7 images. In this study, the LST algorithm was found to have an average error for all cases of -0.211 K compared to the MODIS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) product. For cases where transmission was less than 0.3 and clouds were within 1 km of the validation, the LST RMSE was 2.61 K. When transmission was at least 0.85 and clouds were more than 40 km away, the RMSE was 0.51 K. A LST uncertainty estimation method was developed that utilizes standard error propagation in combination with observed trends between LST error, transmission, and cloud proximity. When the uncertainty method was applied to the global validation dataset, 20% of the estimated LST uncertainties were less than 1 K and 63% were less than 2 K. LST uncertainty can be extended to other Landsat sensors pending small validation studies, and will be an extremely beneficial tool for users, since it allows them to select all pixels in an LST image that meet their accuracy requirements.

AB Multiangle remote sensing plays a central role in the development of algorithms for the retrieval of various surface biophysical parameters that are influenced by the reflectance anisotropy. Surface reflectance anisotropy is characterized by the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). Within the past decade, spaceborne multiangle observations acquired by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor (which has a gridded spatial resolution of 500 m) and by the POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) sensor (which has a spatial resolution of 6 x 7 km) have been used for a wide variety of global applications. However, it is necessary to fully understand the variability inherent in the surface BRDF information as retrieved from MODIS and POLDER at these two spatial resolutions to optimize their use. In this study, we make use of extensive POLDER Bidirectional Reflectance Factors (BRFs) selected from the entire archive of the POLDER BRDF database and standard MODIS BRDF parameter products (MCD43A1, Collection V005) that were geolocated within the same spatial extents as the POLDER data. The variability in surface BRDF is characterized by investigation of three BRDF model parameters as retrieved from MODIS and POLDER and a comprehensive index indicating the variations in the primary dome-bowl BRDF patterns (the anisotropic flat index (AFX)). The principal information content contained in these BRDF data is characterized by the general BRDF shapes (the BRDF archetypes) that account for > 90% of the total variance in these BRDF data. A hotspotrevised BRDF model is used directly on top of the retrieved model BRDF parameters to capture the hotspot effect associated with these BRDF parameters. The main findings of this study show that the variability in surface BRDF, as extracted from the MODIS and POLDER datasets, shares six reciprocal BRDF archetypes. However, the 500-m MODIS BRDF data can uniquely capture some additional extreme BRDF shapes mainly due to the data's finer pixel scales. These original findings are very important, because subsequent albedo retrievals can be significantly impacted by the use of BRDFs of different resolutions. This study provides evidence concerning the influence of spatial resolution on angular variation patterns of optical reflectance as retrieved from the MODIS and POLDER BRDF products.

AB The medium spatial resolution satellite data from the polar-orbiting Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors provide 10 m to 30 m multi-spectral global coverage with a better than 5-day revisit. There are a number of differences between the sensor data that need to be considered before the data can be used together reliably. Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 data for approximately 10 degrees x 10 degrees of southern Africa acquired in two summer (December and January) and in two winter (June and July) months of 2016 were compared. The data were registered and each orbit projected into 30 m fixed non-overlapping tiles defined in the sinusoidal equal area projection. Only corresponding sensor observations of each 30 m tile pixel that were both not cloudy, shadow, saturated, or cirrus contaminated, and that were acquired within one-day of each other, were compared. Both the Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data were atmospherically corrected using the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) and were also corrected to nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance (NBAR). Top of atmosphere (TOA), surface reflectance, and NBAR, for the spectrally corresponding visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) MSI and OLI bands, and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (from the narrow NIR band for MSI), were compared and their sensor differences quantified by regression analyses. Atmospheric contamination and bi-directional reflectance differences were evident in the 65 million pairs of contemporaneous MSI and OLI observations considered. The MSI surface reflectance was greater than the OLI surface reflectance for all the bands except the green, red, and the broad MSI NIR bands, and the MSI surface NDVI was greater than the OLI surface NDVI. This pattern was also found in the NBAR sensor comparisons except for the red bands. Simulated MSI and OLI reflectance derived using the sensor spectral response functions and laboratory spectra showed similar results in the red, NIR and SWIR bands as the real data comparisons. Ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regressions of the 65 million pairs of contemporaneous MSI and OLI data for the three processing levels had good fits (r(2) > 0.87 for the TOA data comparisons, r(2) > 0.89 for the atmospherically corrected data comparisons, r(2) > 0.90 for the NBAR data comparisons; p-values < 0.0001). The OLS regression coefficients are provided so that they can be used to help improve the consistency between Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data.

ID SMOS SOIL-MOISTURE; NDVI DATA; SAHEL
AB Attenuation of surface microwave emission due to the overlying vegetation is proportional to the density of the canopy and to its water content. The vegetation optical depth (VOD) parameter measures this attenuation. VOD could be a valuable source of information on agroecosystems, especially at lower frequencies for which greater portion of the vegetation canopy contributes to the observed brightness temperature. In the past, visible-infrared indices have been used to provide yield estimates based on measuring the photosynthetic activity from the surface canopy layer. These indices are affected by clouds and apply only in the presence of solar illumination. In this study we instead use the L-band microwave radiometer on board of the SMAP mission that provides VOD estimates in all weather and regardless of illumination. This study proposes a series of L-band VOD metrics for crop yield assessment using the first annual cycle of SMAP data (April 2015 to March 2016) over north-central United States. Maps of yield and crop proportion from the US Department of Agriculture are compared to VOD retrieved from SMAP with the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA). The yield-VOD relationship is explored using principal components regressions. Results show that 66% of yield variance is explained over the whole region by the first principal component (PC1). In corn-soy crops, PC1 explains 78% of yield amount, and maximum, standard deviation, and range of VOD capture the yield spatial patterns. Mixture of crops and scene heterogeneity reduced the unique relationships between VOD metrics and yield for specific crops. Hence, in wheat and mixed crops, PC1 explains 43% of yield variance. Results suggest that complementary information on maximum biomass, growth rate, and VOD amplitude can provide robust yield estimates, and that the uncertainty of these estimates depends on crop composition and heterogeneity. This study provides evidence that L-band VOD metrics can potentially be used to enhance crop yield forecasts.

AB When using the kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model to process multiangular measurements, the input multi-angular measurements must be corrected for atmospheric effects. However, in current databases, a significant number of ground-based multi-angular measurements contain either no corrections or only approximate corrections for atmospheric effects. Thus, the blended diffuse light in the total incident irradiance will result in considerable smoothing of the reflectance anisotropy retrieved by the kernel-driven model unless an atmospheric correction process is conducted. In this study, we propose a diffuse light correction (DLC) form of the kernel-driven model that improves its ability to process multi-angular measurements blended with hemispherical diffuse light. The DLC form of the kernel-driven model can be used to retrieve the intrinsic reflectance anisotropy of the observed target from atmospheric-uncorrected multi-angular measurements. This study used multi-angular data simulated by the PROSAIL and Radiosity Applicable to Porous IndiviDual objects (RAPID) BRDF model, atmospheric-corrected Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER), Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) multi-angular measurements and their simulated data based on the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) tools to validate the effectiveness of the DLC form of the kernel-driven model. The results indicated that the reflectance factors directly retrieved by the kernel-driven model are considerably smoothed by the blended diffuse light, especially in hotspot regions. Even under clear and cloudless sky conditions, the retrieved hotspot reflectance in the red band is still underestimated by an average of 9.25%, 7.72%, 11.0% and 13.8% for the PROSAIL, RAPID, POLDER and CAR data, respectively. In contrast, the hotspot reflectance retrieved by the DLC form of the kernel-driven model is very close to the intrinsic reflectance anisotropy of the targets; the average relative by the of the DLC form of the kernel-driven model is only 1.99%, 1.50%, 4.57% and 3.42%, respectively. Although the reflectance reconstructed by the DLC form of the kernel-driven model in the hotspot region represents a considerable improvement compared with the reflectance retrieved by the original kernel-driven model, its improvement on the root mean square error (RMSE) and the bias of the entire datasets is not very apparent. Using the DLC form of the kernel-driven model can significantly improve the ability of the kernel-driven model to process multi-angular measurements blended with hemispherical diffuse irradiance.

AB Quantitatively characterizing the non-random spatial distributions of foliage elements including coniferous needles is critical to map the radiation regime and retrieve the biophysical parameters of a given forest canopy from three-dimensional (3-D) perspective. Different experimental setups bring various challenges to the process of retrieving forest canopy clumping index (CI) using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). In this paper, through developing a voxel-based gap size (VGS) algorithm, we compared the TLS-based forest canopy CIs with the ones obtained using the digital hemispherical photography (DHP)-based and tracing radiation and architecture of canopy (TRAC)-based approaches. Moreover, we investigated the effects of incident directions of solar beams, voxel size, and woody canopy components on the final retrieval accuracy of forest canopy CIs. Our results showed that: (1) TLS -based CIs accounted for 81% (N = 30, p < 0.001) of variations in the DHP-based method. (2) the anisotropic nature of forest canopy CIs suggested that a relatively comprehensive TLS data of a forest canopy was required to investigate the 3-D spatial variations of forest gap size distributions and CIs. (3) The user defined laser sampling spacing was a reliable reference value to determine the voxel size when using the VGS algorithm. (4) It was recommended to separate woody canopy components when computing the forest canopy CI, especially for forest plots with higher proportions of woody material. (5) The effects of the penumbra on TLS based forest canopy CIs were much more limited compared with the traditional optical instruments (i.e., DHP or TRAC). This work provides a solid foundation to dramatically improve the retrieval accuracy of leaf area index (LAI) using TLS.

AB Plant functional traits such as photosynthetic capacity are critical parameters for terrestrial biosphere models. However, their spatial and temporal characteristics are still poorly represented. In this study, we used satellite observations of sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) to estimate top-of-canopy photosynthetic capacity (maximum carboxylation rate, V-cmax at a reference temperature of 25 degrees C) for crops, which was in turn utilized to simulate regional gross primary production (GPP). We first estimate the key parameter, in the widely-used FvCB photosynthesis model using field measurements of CO2 and water fluxes during 2007-2012 at seven crop eddy covariance flux sites over the US Corn Belt. The results showed that satellite far-red SIF retrievals have a stronger link to V-cmax at the seasonal scale (R-2 = 0.70 for C4 and R-2 = 0.63 for C3 crop) as compared with widely-used vegetation indices. We calibrate an empirical model linking V-cmax with SIF that was used to estimate spatially and temporally varying crop V-cmax for the US Corn Belt region. The resulting V-cmax maps are used together with meteorological data from MERRA reanalysis data and vegetation structural parameters derived from the satellite-based spectral reflectance data to constrain the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) balance model in order to estimate regional crop GPP. Our results show a substantial improvement in the seasonal and spatial patterns of cropland GPP when compared with crop yield inventory data. The evaluation with tall tower atmospheric CO2 measurements further supports our estimation of spatiotemporal V-cmax from space-borne SIF. Considering that SIF has a direct link to photosynthetic activity, our findings highlight the potential to infer regional using remotely sensed SIF data and to use this information for a better quantification of regional cropland carbon cycles.

AB Remotely sensed sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been used as an indicator of global terrestrial vegetation photosynthesis. The connection between SIF and photosynthesis allows its use for improving estimates of gross primary production (GPP) and monitoring plant stress. In these analyses, up-scaling of the relationship between SIF and photosynthesis from the photosynthetic level to the canopy, regional or global scale has been one of the main challenges. The scaling is strongly affected by the radiative transfer of emitted SIF, notably scattering and re-absorption of SIF. It is essential to understand these processes in order to differentiate effects of canopy structural variation from effects of photosynthesis functional variation on SIF. In this study, we derive the relationship between canopy scattering of SIF and top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance analytically, by investigating the radiative transfer of incident light and emitted SIF. The similarity of radiative transfer of intercepted incident light and emitted SIF results in a simple relationship between reflectance and canopy scattering of SIF. In particular, we find that the ratio of far-red reflectance (R) to the product of canopy interceptance (i(0)) and leaf albedo (omega) is an accurate estimate of canopy scattering of far-red SIF (i.e.,). SCOPE model simulations are used to validate our findings. The relationship we found provides an easy and accurate approach for rapid decoupling canopy structural and functional regulation of SIF, and correction of SIF for bidirectional effects. This will improve estimates of canopy photosynthesis from SIF.

AB Reliable and consistent topographic data is key to a multitude of environmental manangement and research applications. Unmanned Aerial Systems WAS) are fast establishing themselves as a promising additional remote sensing platform that provides high spatial resolution not only of topography but also surface types and coastal features together with comparatively low costs and high deployment flexibility. However, comprehensive information on the accuracy of UAS-based elevation models in comparison to other available surveying methodology is regulary limited to be referenced to individual methods. This paper addresses this shortcoming by comparing coincident beach surveys of three different point cloud generating methods: ATV mounted mobile laser scan (MLS), airborne LiDAR (ALS), and UAS. This was complemented by two RTK-GPS surveys on a pole with wheel attachment and mounted on an ATV.
   We present results in relation to elevation accuracies on a concrete control surface, the entire beach and for six different beach surface types together with how differences between point clouds propagate during the construction of gridded elevation models. Overall, UAS point cloud elevations were consistently higher than those of ALS (+ 0.063 m) and MLS (+ 0.087 m). However, these results for the entire beach mask larger and smaller differences related to the individual surface characteristics. For all surface types, UAS records higher (from 0.006 m for wet sand to 0.118 m for cobbles, average of 0.063 m) elevations than ALS. The MLS on the other hand, records predominantly lower elevation than ALS (- 0.005 m for beach gravel to - 0.089 m for soft mud, average of - 0.025 m) except for cobbles, where elevations are 0.056 m higher.
   The comparison shows that all point cloud methods produce elevations that are suitable for monitoring changes in beach topography in the context of operational coastal management applications. However, due to the systematic differences between respective monitoring approaches, care needs to be taken when analysing beach topographies for the same area based on different methods.
   The eventual choice of monitoring method is therefore guided by a range of practical factors, including capital cost of the system and operating costs per survey area, conditions under which the system can operate, data processing time, and legal restrictions in the use of the system such as air safety regulations or limitation of ground access to areas with environmental protection.

AB Accurate knowledge of the detailed status (location and lifetime) of each oil/gas platform is crucial for ocean management and for understanding its potential environmental impact. However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is similar to 9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.

AB MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo products (MCD43) have been widely used for a variety of land surface studies since 2000 (e.g., for climate and biosphere modeling, radiative forcing, phonology, and classification schemes). In the past, limitations in computing and archive capacity had restricted the MCD43 retrievals to only once every eight days. The latest reprocessing of the entire archive of Terra and Aqua MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo products (Collection V006) provide retrievals each day and therefore represent a major improvement for phonological and surface monitoring efforts. Compared to the previous retrieval which occurred every 8-days based on a 16-day retrieval period for Collection V005 MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo, this study demonstrates that the Collection V006 MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo product retrieved every day captures significantly more seasonal vegetation dynamics and rapid land surface changes. The Collection V006 product still utilizes the 16-days of directional reflectances surrounding the day of interest (9th day) to retrieve the model of the surface anisotropy but assigns the highest temporal weight to the day of interest (the center date of the retrieval period). Furthermore, the Collection V006 retrievals utilize the day of interest snow/snow-free status to capture snow albedo (an improvement over the previous Collection V005 strategy which based the retrieval on the predominant snow/snow-free status of the majority of the observations over the 16-day retrieval period). All valid clear sky observations from Terra and Aqua are now used for each retrieval, which improves the inversion quality. This is especially true at high latitudes, where up to nine observations from each sensor can be observed per day. Thus, although the high quality full inversion Collection V006 albedo retrieval values are consistent with the Collection V005 results, the overall number of high quality results retrieved has increased. Furthermore, the accuracy of the poorer quality magnitude inversions (which rely on a back-up algorithm) has improved due to utilization of the latest high quality full inversion retrievals as pixel-specific a priori knowledge. The ability of the latest Collection V006 MODIS BRDF/NBAR/Albedo products to capture land surface dynamics is evaluated by using a globally-distributed record of spatially representative tower measurements. The RMSE of broadband shortwave blue-sky albedo at these sites is < 0.0318 and the bias is within +/- 0.0076 for all quality results.

AB The trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions in remote sensing has greatly limited the availability of concurrently high spatiotemporal land surface temperature (LST) data for wide applications. Although many efforts have been made to resolve this dilemma, most have difficulties in generating diurnal fine-resolution LSTs with high spatial details for landscapes with significant heterogeneity and land cover type change. This study proposes an integrated framework to BLEnd Spatiotemporal Temperatures (termed BLEST) of Landsat, MODIS and a geostationary satellite (FY-2F) to one hour interval and 100 m resolution, where (1) a linear temperature mixing model with conversion coefficients is combined to better characterize heterogeneous landscapes and generate more accurate predictions for small and linear objects; (2) residuals are downscaled by a thin plate spline interpolator and restored to the primary fine-resolution estimations to include information about land cover type change; and (3) separate operations at annual and diurnal scales with nonlinear temperature modeling are designed to neutralize the hybrid impacts of large scale gap and land cover type change. BLEST was tested on both simulated data and actual satellite data at annual, diurnal and combined scales, and evaluations were conducted with the simulated/actual fine-resolution data, in-situ data, and with three popular fusion methods, i.e., the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), the Enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) and the spatiotemporal integrated temperature fusion model (STITFM). Results show higher accuracy by BLEST with more spatial details and pronounced temporal evolutions, particularly over heterogeneous landscapes and changing land cover types. BLEST is proposed to augment the spatiotemporal fusion system and further support diurnal dynamic studies in land surfaces.

AB Dissolved organic carbon, DOC, and the colored component of dissolved organic matter, CDOM, are key indicators of coastal water quality and biogeochemical state. Yet applications of space-based remote sensing to monitoring of CDOM variability across estuarine ecosystems and assessment of DOC exchanges along highly dynamic terrestrial-aquatic interfaces have been scarce, in part due to the coarse spatial resolution of most existing ocean color sensors and the seasonal and regional dependence of most existing algorithms. Here, we used a rich dataset of field observations to develop and validate new CDOM and DOC algorithms that are broadly applicable to different estuarine and coastal regions, over different seasons and a wide range of in-water conditions. Algorithms were applied to satellite imagery from MERIS-Envisat at a spatial resolution (300 m) that can resolve much of the spatial variability that characterizes estuaries and their margins. Multi-spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) was used to retrieve CDOM absorption at various wavelengths and CDOM absorption spectral slope in the 275-295 nm spectral range (S275-295). DOC concentrations were obtained from a tight relationship between the DOC-specific CDOM absorption and S275-295, two optical quantities that depend only on the quality of CDOM and strongly covary across spatial and temporal scales. Algorithm evaluation using MERIS satellite data across different estuarine and coastal environments (i.e., the northern Gulf of Mexico, the Delaware Bay, the Chesapeake Bay estuary, and the Middle Atlantic Bight coastal waters) and across different seasons over multiple years resulted in relative errors (mean absolute percent difference; MAPD) of 29% (N = 17), 9.5% (N = 14), and 18% (N = 32), for a(CDOM)(300), S275-295, and DOC, respectively. These relative errors are comparable to those previously reported for satellite retrievals of CDOM and DOC products in less optically complex offshore waters. Application of these algorithms to multi-year MERIS satellite imagery over the Chesapeake Bay estuary allowed, for the first time, to capture the impact of tidal exchanges on carbon dynamics along wetland estuary interfaces, and resolved spatial gradients, seasonal variability, and year-to-year changes in estuarine carbon amount and quality associated with marsh carbon export, riverine inputs, and extreme precipitation events.

AB Use of data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a well-established practice for enhancing the accuracy of forest inventories in combination with ground-based observations. For regular monitoring of large areas, wall-to-wall ALS data is economically prohibitive. However, when data are acquired in a strip-sampling mode, ALS can support the estimation of forest resources on large areas such as counties, states, and nations. This study investigated the combined use of ALS data acquired along parallel strips and co-located field observations of live and standing dead trees to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) at regional and sub-regional levels. The study area comprised the Tanana Inventory Unit (TIU) (138,566 km(2)), located in interior Alaska, and four sub-regions (106-7282 km(2)) within the TIU. The field data consisted of 1676 ground observations from six independent field campaigns. Ninety-four plots came from the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the USDA Forest Service. The FIA plots, each consisting of four 1/60 ha subplots, were acquired using a probabilistic sampling design. The remaining ground observations were collected during field inventories across TIU, and consisted of 335 independent field plots and 257 clusters containing up to four plots each. The estimation procedure followed a two-phase sampling design grounded within a hybrid inferential framework, which combines design-based estimation for the first phase and model-based inference in the second phase. Post-stratified estimation by land cover class indicated that the hybrid estimation obtained 11-55% better precision compared to direct (design based) estimation based solely on field observations. When the field sample sizes were reduced to 25%, the standard errors for the hybrid estimation increased by 3 to 5 pp. Direct and hybrid estimates were compared for two sub-regions, and the hybrid estimated AGBs were 6.4% and 13.3% larger than the direct estimates. On both these study sub-regions, the 95% confidence interval of the hybrid estimated mean AGB included the direct estimate of the mean and vice versa.

AB Imaging spectroscopy based methods offer unique capabilities for retrieving narrow-band vegetation indices which can be empirically related to functional traits of plants. However, in areas with complex topography, illumination effects affect the retrieval of such indices from high spatial resolution airborne or satellite data. Irradiance components at the pixel level are determined by atmospheric composition, as well as instantaneous illumination-surface-sensor geometries. An accurate pixel-wise description of direct and diffuse irradiance components is necessary to perform atmospheric corrections, finally resulting in improved surface reflectances and hence products. We assess three atmospheric correction strategies, differing in their approaches to simulate instantaneous as well as pixel-wise abundances of diffuse and direct irradiance. We use physically-based approaches in combination with either digital elevation models (DEM), fine resolution digital object models (DOM), or 3D modelling output from the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model. The such obtained top-of-canopy reflectances at the Laegern test-site in Switzerland, are used to assess retrieval improvement for a set of indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), as well as chlorophyll and carotenoid indices). We demonstrate that both, the DOM and the DART based approach, improve the retrievals for flat cast-shadows by <= 71% compared to using a DEM. In dense forest areas, improvements are less significant. Remaining key issues are related to overestimating surface reflectance under extreme illumination conditions.

AB The impact of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO)on the global land surface soil moisture was explored in the study. The MJO index was calculated from long term 1997-2013 GPCP precipitation and ERA-Interim 850-hPa and 250-hPa zonal winds. The composites of soil moisture anomalies over eight MJO phases were mapped and analyzed. In order to distinguish the MJO signal with other patterns of climate variability, only MJO event days are used in the composites. In addition, the statistical significance of the anomaly composites is estimated using the Student's t-test. The MJO has been found to be the prominent source of the intraseasonal variation of the monsoon systems, which induces the variations of precipitation. Our results show that the variation of soil moisture between MJO phases also agrees well with the variation of the monsoon systems. In addition to the monsoon regions, the MJO also affects soil moisture over other areas such as East Africa. The relation between the soil moisture and precipitation anomaly composites across the MJO phases was also investigated. The results show that the variation of soil moisture over MJO phases is related to its connection to precipitation. In addition, large similarities were found between the GPCP-derived MJO index and the corresponding ESA CCI soil moisture composites, and ERA-Interim-derived MJO index and corresponding ERA-Interim soil moisture composites. This proves the feasibility of ERA-Interim datasets for MJO related studies. Owing to the different resolutions of the CCI and ERA-Interim soil moisture, CCI is more appropriate for regional and ERA-Interim dataset for large-scale MJO related analysis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer) is an imaging sensor onboard Terra/Aqua platform which provides information in 36 spectral bands. Spectral mixing of features due to high data dimensionality and high inter-band correlations constitutes the biggest challenge in the analysis of MODIS. data. In view of this, present study attempts to develop a novel strategy involving Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Band to Band Correlation (BTBC) analysis, Stepwise Discriminant Analysis (SDA), and separability analysis to reduce the data dimensionality for extracting reliable and maximum information for wetland areal extent using coarse resolution MODIS (1 Inn) data. The PCA explains variability in data and removes data redundant information; BTBC analysis eradicates the high correlated bands providing best bands suitable for wetland mapping; SDA evaluates the discriminatory power of different MODIS bands to discriminate the wetlands from other class types. Further, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Wetland Model Index (WMI) were also incorporated into the study to improve the classification accuracy. Finally, separability analysis was conducted to optimize the selected MODIS bands and indices.
   Results of rigorous data mining reveal that out of 24 input layers of MODIS (1 km) data (22 optical MODIS bands, NDVI and WMI), only 4 input layers (WMI, NDVI, MODIS bands - NIR band 2 and SWIR band 6) are best suited for delineation and mapping of wetlands. This study also corroborates the usage of WMI, a newly developed index with combination of visible and short wavelength infra red (SWIR) MODIS bands, as the most optimal input layer to separate wetlands from the other land use class types (barren land, agricultural land, rivers/canals/streams, forest, wasteland/gullied or riverine land). It was observed that the magnitude of mapped wetland areal extent using MODIS (1 km) data varied from 105,053 ha in 2010-2011 to 111,479 ha in 2011-2012 accounting for 0.44% (2010-2011)-0.46% (2011-2012) of the total geographical area of Uttar Pradesh, India. Seasonally, monsoon season displayed maximum wetland area with overall accuracy of 92% whereas summer season exhibited minimum wetland area with overall accuracies varying from 85 to 87% during both the sampling years. The output of the present research work will not only facilitate to improve the wetland area estimates but also provide an important input for climate change predictions in wetlands over large areas.

AB Full polarimetric L-band PALSAR data facilitated one of the first empirical assessments of the relationships between radar polarization properties (RPPs) and ecological pattern properties (EPPs) in desert fringe ecosystems. Correlations between radar parameters (polarized backscattering intensities, their ratios, entropy, and degrees of polarization) and remotely sensed ecological parameters (shrub cover, edge parameter, average shrub height, and biomass information) were analyzed for 52 least-disturbed sites along a climatic gradient between semi-arid and arid zones in the south-eastern Mediterranean. The degree of horizontal polarization (DOHP) was the RPP that was most highly correlated with all EPPs, while NDVIR biomass (NDVI multiplied by relative rainfall) was the EPP most highly correlated with all RPPs. Combinations of NDVIR biomass and DOHP data exhibited consistent inverse relationships for both the 52 least-disturbed sites as well as for the entire gradient. Mapping these combinations along the transition zone enabled differentiation of desert fringe areas and dense shrub and tree areas, with three transition typologies between the two. Although DOHP is instrumental in detecting changes in tall shrub coverage, it was found to be insufficiently sensitive to surface conditions in areas with dwarf shrubs and shrubs of biomass lower than 0.7 kg/m(2) at the end of the summer. Differentiation between the desert, desert fringe, and semi-arid margins of high DOHP values (> 0.9) was facilitated by differences in their NDVIR biomass. Areas of high anthropogenic influence on the landscape, i.e. abandoned terraces and low-density pine plantations, deviate significantly from the inverse DOHP and NDVIR biomass relationship, as both were characterized by low values in these parameterization. The wide extent of DOHP and NDVIR combinations representing desert fringe ecosystems and arid lands indicated a continuation of degradation processes in areas with rainfalls > 500 mm/year. The technique developed, which utilizes DOHP, provides new means for mapping desert fringe ecosystems and for exploring desertification over wide regions.

AB Classification is a fundamental process in remote sensing used to relate pixel values to land cover classes present on the surface. Over large areas land cover classification is challenging particularly due to the cost and difficulty of collecting representative training data that enable classifiers to be consistent and locally reliable. A novel methodology to classify large volume Landsat data using high quality training data derived from the 500 m MODIS land cover product is demonstrated and used to generate a 30 m land cover classification for all of North America between 20 degrees N and 50 degrees N. Publically available 30 m global monthly Web-enabled Landsat Data (GWELD) products generated from every available Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 5 TM image for a three year period, that are defined aligned to the MODIS land products and are consistently pre-processed data (cloud-screened, saturation flagged, atmospherically corrected and normalized to nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance), were classified. The MODIS 500 m land cover product was filtered judiciously, using only good quality pixels that did not change land cover class in 2009, 2010 or 2011, followed by automated selection of spatially corresponding 30 m GWELD temporal metric values, to define a large training data set sampled across North America. The training data were sampled so that the class proportions were the same as the North America MODIS land cover product class proportions and corresponded to 1% of the 500 m and <0.005% of the 30 m pixels. Thirty nine GWELD temporal metrics for every 30 m North America pixel location were classified using (a) a single random forest, and (b) a locally adaptive method with a random forest classifier derived and applied locally and the classification results spatially mosaicked together. The land cover classification results appeared geographically plausible and at synoptic scale were similar to the MODIS land cover product. Detailed visual inspection revealed that the locally adaptive random forest classifications and associated classification confidences were generally more coherent than the single random forest classification results. The level of agreement between the 30 m classifications and the MODIS land cover product derived training data was assessed by bootstrapping the random forest implementation. The locally adaptive random forest classification had higher overall agreement (95.44%, 0.9443 kappa) than the single random forest classification (93.13%, 0.9195 kappa). The paper concludes with a discussion of future research including the potential for automated global land cover classification. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB At the plant or stand level, leaf orientation is often highly anisotropic and heterogeneous, yet most analyses neglect such complexity. In many cases, this is due to the difficulty in measuring the spatial variation of the leaf angle distribution function. There is a critical need for a technique that can rapidly measure the leaf angle distribution function at any point in space and time. A new method was developed and tested that uses terrestrial LiDAR scanning data to rapidly measure the three-dimensional distribution of leaf orientation for an arbitrary volume of leaves. The method triangulates laser-leaf intersection points recorded by the LiDAR scan, which allows for easy calculation of normal vectors. As a byproduct, the triangulation also yields continuous surfaces that reconstruct individual leaves. In order to produce a probability density function for leaf orientation from triangle normal vectors, it is critical that the proper weighting be applied to each triangle. Otherwise, results will heavily bias toward normal vectors pointed toward the the LiDAR scanner. The method was validated using artificially generated LiDAR data where the exact leaf angle distributions were known, and in the field for an isolated tree and a grapevine canopy by comparing LiDAR-generated distribution functions to manual measurements. The artificial test cases demonstrated the consistency of the method, and quantitatively showed that errors in the predicted leaf angle distribution functions decreased as scan resolution was increased or as the density of leaves was increased. The isolated tree field validation showed qualitatively similar trends between manual and LiDAR measurements of distribution functions. Manual measurements of leaf orientation in the vineyard were shown to have large errors due to high leaf curvature, which illustrated the benefits of the more detailed LiDAR measurement method.

AB The atmospheric correction of satellite data is challenging over desert agricultural systems, due to the relatively high aerosol optical thicknesses (T-550), bright soils, and a heterogeneous surface reflectance field. Indeed, the contribution of reflected radiation from adjacent pixels scattered into the field of view of a target pixel is considerable and can significantly affect the fidelity of retrieved reflectances. In this study, uncertainties and quantitative errors associated with the atmospheric correction of multi-spectral Landsat 8 and RapidEye data were characterized over a desert agricultural landscape in Saudi Arabia. Surface reflectances were retrieved using an implementation of the 6SV atmospheric correction code, and validated against field collected spectroradiometer measurements over desert, cultivated soil, and vegetated surface targets. A combination of satellite and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data were used to parameterize aerosol properties and atmospheric state parameters. With optimal specification of T550 and aerosol optical properties and correction for adjacency effects, the relative Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) for all bands combined was 5.4% for RapidEye and 6.8% for Landsat 8. However uncertainties associated with satellite-based T-550 retrievals were shown to introduce significant error into the reflectance estimates. With respect to deriving common vegetation indices from corrected reflectance data, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was associated with the smallest errors (3-8% MAD). Surface reflectance errors were highest for bands in the visible part of the spectrum, particularly the blue band (5-16%), while there was more consistency within the red-edge (similar to 5%) and near-infrared (5-7%). Results were generally better constrained when a T-550-dependent aerosol model for desert dust particles, parameterized on the basis of nearby AERONET site data, was used in place of a generic rural or background desert model. This adaptation was particularly pertinent for the Landsat bands in the shortwave infrared. Failure to correct for adjacency effects increased the overall surface reflectance MAD to around 18%. The impact was especially significant for the visible bands over vegetated surface targets, as evidenced by relative MADs increasing to >200%. In comparison, a relatively minor adjacency effect was observed within the near-infrared and over the more reflective bare soil and desert sites. Overall, the impact of adjacency effects was substantial (20-25% MAD) for all of the studied vegetation indices. This investigation fills a research gap in the quantification of uncertainties and evaluation of achievable accuracy levels in high spatial resolution surface reflectance imagery over desert agriculture and highlights the need for accurate and regionally representative atmospheric correction techniques.

AB In this study, we investigate the possibility of using a coupled meteorology-aerosol data assimilation (DA) to improve the forecast of a dust storm. We interfaced a coupled meteorology-chemistry model (WRF-Chem) with a hybrid variational-ensemble DA system - the Maximum Likelihood Ensemble Filter (MLEF). The system is strongly coupled, in the sense that cross-covariances between meteorological and aerosol control variables are used in DA. Experiments are conducted for an Asian dust storm case that occurred over the Korean Peninsula on 13 May 2011, by assimilating both meteorological and aerosol observations. Meteorological observations include the conventional ones and the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) satellite radiances, whereas aerosol observations contain aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500nm from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). In the control experiment (CTNL), we assimilated only meteorological observations. In the AODDA experiment, we assimilated both AOD and meteorological observations. Control variables of DA include both meteorological and aerosol ones. Our results indicate that meteorological observations can partially contribute to the change of aerosol initial conditions and vice versa, implying a cross-component impact of observations, and hence improving the utility of observations in coupled DA. The forecast comparison indicates a consistently improved fit to AOD observations after 24 h of DA. In addition, uncertainty of the 24-hour aerosol forecast in AODDA decreases significantly in local regions - by up to similar to 21.6% in terms of innovations, and up to similar to 81.4% in terms of square root forecast error covariance. These results are encouraging for future applications of ensemble DA with strongly coupled meteorology-chemistry modeling system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the present study we applied X-band interferometric SAR (InSAR) data from the TanDEM-X mission, and investigated the relationship between InSAR height above ground and above-ground biomass (AGB) in a forest with very high biomass. We carried out this study in the East Usambara Mountains in Tanzania, with AGB ranging up to > 1000 t/ha. Field inventory provided AGB data for 153 plots of 900 m(2) in size. An airborne laser scanning (ALS) provided a DTM as well as AGB predictions for larger 8100 m(2) cells over the entire study area. Three TanDEM-X acquisitions provided single-pass InSAR data, from which we generated a Digital Surface Models (DSM) and InSAR height by subtracting the ALS DTM. The results showed that proportionality may represent the relationship where AGB increased with 18.4 t/ha per m increase in InSAR height. The accuracy was low with RMSE = 203 t/ha (44%), which was partly attributable to small field plots and partly to a limited sensitivity of InSAR height to variations in basal area and stand density. An identical proportionality model, with less residual noise, was achieved by replacing the small field plots with the 8100 m(2) cells having AGB predictions from ALS data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB The fine-mode fraction (FMF) can be a useful tool to separate natural aerosols from man-made aerosols and to assist in estimating surface concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter < 2.5 mu m. A LookUp Table-based Spectral Deconvolution Algorithm (LUT-SDA) was developed here for satellite-based applications using data such as MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements. This method was validated against ground-based FMF retrievals from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). The LUT-SDA was then applied to two MODIS-retrieved aerosol optical thickness (AOT) products for the period of December 2013 to July 2015: the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) Dark Target (DT) AOT product and the simplified high-resolution MODIS Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) AOT product. In comparison with the MODIS C6 FMF product in three study areas (Beijing, Hong Kong, and Osaka), FMFs estimated by the LUT-SDA agreed more closely with those retrieved from the AERONET with a very low bias. Eighty percent of the FMF values fell within the expected error range of +/- 0.4. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.168 with few anomalous values, whereas the RMSE for the MODIS FMF was 0.340 with more anomalous values. The LUT-SDA FMF estimated using SARA AOT data conveys more detailed information on urban pollution than that from MODIS C6 DT AOT data. As a demonstration, the seasonally-averaged spatial distribution of the FMF in Beijing was obtained from the LUT-SDA applied to SARA AOT data and compared with that of the AERONET-retrieved FMF. Their seasonal trends agreed well. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB It has been known and documented that the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) on-board Landsat 8 suffers from a significant stray light problem (Reuter et al., 2015; Montanaro et al., 2014a). The issue appears both as a non-uniform banding artifact across Earth scenes and as a varying absolute radiometric calibration error. A correction algorithm proposed by Montanaro et al. (2015) demonstrated great potential towards removing most of the stray light effects from TIRS image data. It has since been refined and will be implemented operationally into the Landsat Product Generation System in early 2017. The algorithm is trained using near-coincident thermal data (i.e., Terra/MODIS) to develop per-detector functional relationships between incident out-of-field radiance and additional (stray light) signal on the TIRS detectors. Once trained, the functional relationships are used to estimate and remove the stray light signal on a per-detector basis from a scene of interest.
   The details of the operational stray light correction algorithm"are presented here along with validation studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in removing the stray light artifacts over a stressing range of Landsat/FIRS scene conditions. Results show that the magnitude of the banding artifact is reduced by half on average over the current (uncorrected) product and that the absolute radiometric error is reduced to approximately 0.5% in both spectral bands on average (well below the 2% requirement). All studies presented here indicate that the implementation of the stray light algorithm will lead to greatly improved performance of the TIRS instrument, for both spectral bands.

AB Measuring post-fire effects at landscape scales is critical to an ecological understanding of wildfire effects. Predominantly this is accomplished with either multi-spectral remote sensing data or through ground-based field sampling plots. While these methods are important, field data is usually limited to opportunistic post-fire observations, and spectral data often lacks validation with specific variables of change. Additional uncertainty remains regarding how best to account for environmental variables influencing fire effects (e.g., weather) for which observational data cannot easily be acquired, and whether pre-fire agents of change such as bark beetle and timber harvest impact model accuracy. This study quantifies wildfire effects by correlating changes in forest structure derived from multi-temporal Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) acquisitions to multi-temporal spectral changes captured by the Landsat Thematic Mapper and Operational Land Imager for the 2012 Pole Creek Fire in central Oregon. Spatial regression modeling was assessed as a methodology to account for spatial autocorrelation, and model consistency was quantified across areas impacted by pre-fire mountain pine beetle and timber harvest. The strongest relationship (pseudo-r(2) = 0.86, p < 0.0001) was observed between the ratio of shortwave infrared and near infrared reflectance (d74) and LiDAR-derived estimate of canopy cover change. Relationships between percentage of LiDAR returns in forest strata and spectral indices generally increased in strength with strata height. Structural measurements made closer to the ground were not well correlated. The spatial regression approach improved all relationships, demonstrating its utility, but model performance declined across pre-fire agents of change, suggesting that such studies should stratify by pre-fire forest condition. This study establishes that spectral indices such as d74 and dNBR are most sensitive to wildfire-caused structural changes such as reduction in canopy cover and perform best when that structure has not been reduced pre-fire.

AB Remote sensing of nighttime lights has been shown as a good surrogate for estimating population and economic activity at national and sub-national scales, using DMSP satellites. However, few studies have examined the factors explaining differences in nighttime brightness of cities at a global scale. In this study, we derived quantitative estimates of nighttime lights with the new VIIRS sensor onboard the Suomi NPP satellite in January 2014 and in July 2014, with two variables: mean brightness and percent lit area. We performed a global analysis of all densely populated areas (n = 4153, mostly corresponding to metropolitan areas), which we defined using high spatial resolution Landscan population data. National GDP per capita was better in explaining nighttime brightness levels (0.60 < Rs < 0.70) than GDP density at a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees (0.25 < Rs < 0.43), or than a city-level measure of GDP per capita (in proportion to each city's fraction of the national population: 0.49 < Rs < 0.62). We found that in addition to GDP per capita, the nighttime brightness of densely populated areas was positively correlated with MODIS derived percent urban area (0.46 < Rs < 0.60), the density of the road network (0.51 < Rs < 0.67), and with latitude (0.31 <Rs <0.42) at p <0.001. NDVI values (representing vegetation cover) were found to be negatively correlated with cities' brightness in winter time (-0.48 < Rs < 0.22), whereas snow cover (enhancing artificial light reflectance) was found to be positively correlated with cities' brightness in winter time (0.17 < Rs < 0.35). Overall, the generalized linear model we built was able to explain >45% of the variability in cities' nighttime brightness, when both physical and socio-economic variables were included. Within the generalized linear model, the percent of national GDP derived from income (rents) from natural gas and oil, was also found as one of the statistically significant variables. Our findings show that cities' nighttime brightness can change with the seasons as a function of vegetation and snow cover, two variables affecting surface albedo. Explaining cities' nighttime brightness is therefore affected not only by country level factors (such as GDP), but also by the built environment and by climatic factors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study evaluates a direct remote sensing approach from space for the determination of ecosystem photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE), through measurement of vegetation reflectance changes expressed with the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). The PRI is a normalized difference index based on spectral changes at a physiologically active wavelength (similar to 531 nm) as compared to a reference waveband, and is only available from a very few satellites. These include the two Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS) on the Aqua and Terra satellites each of which have a narrow (10 nm) ocean band centered at 531 nm. We examined several PRI variations computed with candidate reference bands, since MODIS lacks the traditional 570 nm reference band. The PRI computed using MODIS land band 1 (620-670 nm) gave the best performance for daily LUE estimation. Through rigorous statistical analyses over a large image collection (n = 420), the success of relating in situ daily tower-derived LUE to MODIS observations for northern forests was strongly influenced by satellite viewing geometry. LUE was calculated from CO2 fluxes (mol C mol(-1) absorbed quanta) measured at instrumented Canadian Carbon Program flux towers in four Canadian forests: a mature fir site in British Columbia, mature aspen and black spruce sites in Saskatchewan, and a mixed deciduous/coniferous forest site in Ontario. All aspects of the viewing geometry had significant effects on the MODIS-PRI, including the view zenith angle (VZA), the view azimuth angle, and the displacement of the view azimuth relative to the solar principal plane, in addition to illumination related variables. Nevertheless, we show that forward scatter sector views (VZA, 16 degrees-45 degrees) provided the strongest relationships to daily LUE, especially those collected in the early afternoon by Aqua (r(2) = 0.83, RMSE = 0.003 mol C mol(-1) absorbed quanta). Nadir (VZA, 0 15) and backscatter views (VZA, 16 to 45) had lower performance in estimating LUE (nadir: r(2) similar to 0.62-0.67; bacicscatter: r(2) similar to 0.54-0.59) and similar estimation error (RMSE = 0.004-0.005). When directional effects were not considered, only a moderately successful MODIS-PRI vs. LUE relationship (r(2) = 0.34, RMSE = 0.007) was obtained in the full dataset (all views & sites, both satellites), but site-specific relationships were able to discriminate between coniferous and deciduous forests. Overall, MODIS-PRI values from Terra (late morning) were higher than those from Aqua (early afternoon), before/after the onset of diurnal stress responses expressed spectrally. Therefore, we identified ninety-two Terra-Aqua "same day" pairs, for which the sum of Terra morning and Aqua afternoon MODIS-PRI values (PRIsum) using all available directional observations was linearly correlated with daily tower LUE (r(2) = 0.622, RMSE = 0.013) and independent of site differences or meteorological information. Our study highlights the value of off-nadir directional reflectance observations, and the value of pairing morning and afternoon satellite observations to monitor stress responses that inhibit carbon uptake in Canadian forest ecosystems.
   In addition, we show that MODIS-PRI values, when derived from either: (i) forward views only, or (ii) Terra/Aqua same day (any view) combined observations, provided more accurate estimates of tower-measured daily LUE than those derived from either nadir or backscatter views or those calculated by the widely used semi-operational MODIS GPP model (MOD17) which is based on a theoretical maximum LUE and environmental data. Consequently, we demonstrate the importance of diurnal as well as off-nadir satellite observations for detecting vegetation physiological processes. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has been proposed as a reliable remote sensing technique for supporting biomass and carbon stock estimation under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries (UN-REDD). Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), developing countries can receive financial benefits from REDD+ activities upon the implementation of reliable measuring, verification, and reporting mechanisms. As a UN-REDD country, Tanzania has implemented the National Forestry Resources Monitoring and Assessment (NAFORMA) program as a cost-efficient solution for providing an appropriate level of precision required for sustainable forest management practices, and for international reporting on carbon pools and carbon pools change estimates at national and regional scales. The main objective of the study was to investigate various design- and model-based sampling strategies incorporating ALS measurements for estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB) in miombo woodlands. The field data consisted of 65 clusters containing 513 circular NAFORMA ground plots located in Liwale District (15,867 km(2)), southeastern Tanzania, on which the aboveground tree biomass was estimated using locally developed allometric models. The ALS measurements were acquired along 32 parallel flight lines oriented in the east west direction, covering nearly 26% of Liwale District The flight lines were spaced 5 km apart and were distributed over the ground plots. Compared to the uncertainty (standard error) of the field-based estimate (4.79 Mg ha(-1)), the uncertainties of the ALS-assisted AGB estimates were consistently lower, varying from 1.73 Mg ha(-1) up to 252 Mg ha(-1) under two-stage cluster sampling, and 1.96 Mg ha(-1) for double sampling with regression estimation. Finally, strengths and shortcomings of using the NAFORMA inventory for ALS-assisted biomass estimation were discussed, underlining the implications of the field inventory design. Importantly, this study reveals the difficulty of accommodating a double sampling for stratification design, which was employed for NAFORMA, with an ALS survey having the flight lines systematically positioned over the landscape.

AB Spatially explicit information on tree species composition of managed and natural forests, plantations and urban vegetation provides valuable information for nature conservationists as well as for forest and urban managers and is frequently required over large spatial extents. Over the last four decades, advances, in remote sensing technology have enabled the classification of tree species from several sensor types.
   While studies using remote sensing data to classify and map tree species reach back several decades, a recent review on the status, potentials, challenges and outlooks in this realm is missing. Here, we search for major trends in remote sensing techniques for tree species classification and discuss the effectiveness of different sensors and algorithms based on a literature review.
   This review demonstrates that the number of studies focusing on tree species classification has increased constantly over the last four decades and promising local scale approaches have been presented for several sensor types. However, there are few examples for tree species classifications over large geographic extents, and bridging the gap between current approaches and tree species inventories over large geographic extents is still one of the biggest challenges of this research field. Furthermore, we found only few studies which systematically described and examined the traits that drive the observed variance in the remote sensing signal and thereby enable or hamper species classifications. Most studies followed data-driven approaches and pursued an optimization of classification accuracy, while a concrete hypothesis or a targeted application was missing in all but a few exceptional studies.
   We recommend that future research efforts focus stronger on the causal understanding of why tree species classification approaches work under certain conditions or maybe even more important - why they do not work in other cases. This might require more complex field acquisitions than those typically used in the reviewed studies. At the same time, we recommend reducing the number of purely data-driven studies and algorithm-benchmarking studies as these studies are of limited value, especially if the experimental design is limited, e.g. the tree population is not representative and only a few sensors or acquisition settings are simultaneously investigated.

AB The scattering properties of the radar signal at Ma and Ku-band frequencies are investigated using a theoretical model and snow grain observations obtained during previous field campaigns. Our results show that the combination of radar altimeters operating at these two frequencies should allow for the retrieval of snow depth over Arctic sea ice. We estimate uncertainties of the ice surface position in relation to crossover observations over sea ice and show that the accuracy of the crossover methodology with short time gap (3 days or less) is better than 3 cm. Comparison of the CryoSat-2/AltiKa retrieved snow depth with in situ measurements provided by Operation IceBridge shows a good agreement with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5 cm. Analysis of the CryoSat-2/AltiKa retrieved snow depths over three winters (2013-2015) reveals a thinner snow cover on both Multi-Year (32%-57%) and First-Year Ice (63%-75%) relative to the 1954-91 Warren climatology, suggesting the need for snore contemporary year-round and basin-scale snow depth fields.

AB Remote sensing data allow large scale observation of forested ecosystems. Forest assessment benefits from information about individual trees. Multibaseline SAR interferometry (InSAR) is able to generate dense point clouds of forest canopies, similar to airborne laser scanning (ALS). This type of point cloud was generated using data from the Ka-band MEMPHIS system, acquired over a mainly coniferous forest near Vordemwald in the Swiss Midlands. This point cloud was segmented using an advanced clustering technique to detect individual trees and derive their positions, heights, and crown diameters. To evaluate the InSAR point cloud properties and limitations, it was compared to products derived from ALS and stereo-photogrammetry. All point clouds showed similar geolocation accuracies with 02-0.3 m relative shifts. Both InSAR and photogrammetry techniques yielded points predominantly located in the upper levels of the forest vegetation, while ALS provided points from the top of the canopy down to the understory and forest floor. The canopy height models agreed very well with each other, with R-2 values between 0.84 and 0.89. The detected trees and their estimated physical and structural parameters were validated by comparing them to reference forestry data. A detection rate of similar to 90% was achieved for larger trees, corresponding to half of the reference trees. The smaller trees were detected with a success rate of similar to 50%. The tree height was slightly underestimated, with a R-2 value of 0.63. The estimated crown diameter agreed on an average sense, however with a relatively low R-2 value of 0.19. Very high success rates (>90%) were obtained when matching the trees detected from the InSAR-data with those detected from the ALS- and photogrammetry-data. There, InSAR tree heights were in the mean 1-1.5 m lower, with high R-2 values ranging between 0.8 and 0.9. Our results demonstrate the use of millimeter wave SAR interferometry data as an alternative to ALS- and photogrammetry-based data for forest monitoring. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, the potential use of P-band radar signals for the estimation of soil roughness parameters is analyzed. The numerical moment method backscattering model is used to study the sensitivity to soil roughness parameters of backscattered P-band signals. Two roughness scales related to terrain microtopography and low frequency roughness structures are considered. In the case of microtopography, the rms height is shown to be the dominant influence in the relationship between radar signals and roughness. For low frequency structures, the parameter Zs is strongly correlated with the backscattered signals. An analysis of the behavior of P-band radar signals as a function of multi-scale soil roughness (microtopography and large-scale roughness structures) reveals the complexity of using P-band data for the study of bare surface soil parameters.
   The Moment method model is then compared with the real data covering a large range of microtopographic roughness values, derived from experimental airborne P-band SAR campaigns made over agricultural fields, at two sites in France. The significant discrepancies observed between measurements and simulations confirm the limitations of an analysis based on microtopographic characterizations only. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB There are many types of changes occurring over the Earth's landscapes that can be detected and monitored using Landsat data. Here we focus on monitoring "within-state," gradual changes in vegetation in contrast with traditional monitoring of "abrupt" land-cover conversions. Gradual changes result from a variety of processes, such as vegetation growth and succession, damage from insects and disease, responses to shifts in climate, and other factors. Despite the prevalence of gradual changes across the landscape, they are largely ignored by the remote sensing community. Gradual changes are best characterized and monitored using time-series analysis, and with the successful launch of Landsat 8 we now have appreciable data continuity that extends the Landsat legacy across the previous 43 years. In this study, we conducted three related analyses: (1) comparison of spectral values acquired by Landsats 7 and 8, separated by eight days, to ensure compatibility for time-series evaluation; (2) tracking of multitemporal signatures for different change processes across Landsat 5, 7, and 8 sensors using anniversary-date imagery; and (3) tracking the same type of processes using all available acquisitions. In this investigation, we found that data representing natural vegetation from Landsats 5, 7, and 8 were comparable and did not indicate a need for major modification prior to use for long-term monitoring. Analyses using- anniversary-date imagery can be very effective for assessing long term patterns and trends occurring across the landscape, and are especially good for providing insights regarding trends related to long-term and continuous trends of growth or decline. We found that use of all available data provided a much more comprehensive level of understanding of the trends occurring, providing information about rate, duration, and intra- and inter-annual variability that could not be readily gleaned from the anniversary date analyses. We observed that using all available clear Landsat 5-8 observations with the new Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm was very effective for illuminating vegetation trends. There are a number of potential challenges for assessing gradual changes, including atmospheric impacts, algorithm development and visualization of the changes. One of the biggest challenges for studying gradual change will be the lack of appropriate data for validating results and products. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The main objective of this study is to propose and evaluate a new approach to overcome the major limitation of downscaling methods based on optical/thermal data, particularly the DlSaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DISPATCH) algorithm. Data collected over an agricultural site located in Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) during the SMAP Validation Experiments 2012 (SMAPVEXI2) field campaign were used. At this site, SMOS soil moisture estimates showed a relatively good correlation for both AM and PM overpasses (R >= 0.67), but with a significant underestimation (bias approximate to -0.10 m(3)/m(3)), when compared to ground data. SMOS soil moisture data also showed a significant sensitivity to rainfall events. The DISPATCH algorithm was used to downscale bias-corrected SMOS soil moisture data over the study area for the cloud-free days during SMAPVEXI2. Compared to ground data, DISPATCH performed well, especially with the soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) linear model (R = 0.81, bias = -0.01 m(3)/m(3), RMSE = 0.05 m(3)/m(3)), which slightly outperformed the SEE non-linear model (R = 0.72, bias = -0.01 m(3)/m(3), RMSE = 0.06 m(3)/m(3)). For both models, the accuracy of the downscaling soil moisture is inversely proportional to the absolute value of soil moisture. For cloudy days, a new operational downscaling approach was proposed. It consists of combining the soil moisture simulations of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS) with DISPATCH-downscaled soil moisture during cloud-free days in order to provide estimates of temporally continuous series of soil moisture at 1 km resolution. Compared to ground soil moisture data, the results indicated the high potential of our approach to retrieve soil moisture at 1 km resolution during cloudy days (R = 0.80, bias = -0.01 m(3)/m(3), RMSE = 0.07 m(3)/m(3)).

AB Remote sensing of night-lights has been enhanced in recent years with the availability of the new VIIRS Day and Night band, the commercial EROS-B satellite and astronaut photographs from the International Space Station. However, dedicated space-borne multispectral sensors offering radiance calibrated night lights imagery are yet to be launched. Here we examined the capabilities of Landsat 8 to acquire night time light images of the Earth. Examining seven night-time Landsat 8 scenes, we found that brightly lit areas in both urban (Berlin, Las Vegas, Nagoya and Tel-Aviv) and gas flares (Basra, Kuwait) areas were detected in all eight bands of Landsat 8. The threshold for detection of lit areas was approximately 0.4 W/m(2)/mu m/sr in bands 1-5 and 8 of Landsat 8. This threshold level was higher than Landsat dark noise levels, and slightly lower than post launch Landsat 8 OLI band dependent noise equivalent radiance difference levels. Drawing on this, we call on the USGS to plan an annual night-time acquisition of urban and gas flares areas globally, and to enable the performance of the future Landsat 10 to be established in a way that it will be sensitive enough to image the Earth at night, thus performing as Nightsat during the night.

AB The SMOS mission is a European Space Agency project aimed at global monitoring of surface Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity from radiometric L-band observations. Although the L-band is a protected band, the data collected by SMOS are contaminated by radio frequency interferences (RFI) which degrade the performance of the mission. A precise location of the RFI emitters is required for switching off illegal transmissions or for fixing malfunctioning equipments. This work is concerned with the geolocation of such sources with a sub-kilometric accuracy from SMOS interferometric data themselves. Such a precise location has never been reached by any other published methods using only SMOS measurements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Earth Observation (EO) technology is today at a maturity level that allows deriving operational estimates of Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) from a variety of sensors; yet, such products are provided at present at a coarse spatial and/or temporal resolution, which restricts their use in local or regional scale studies and practical applications. Herein, a methodology to derive SSM estimates from space at previously unattained spatio-temporal resolutions is proposed. The method is based on a variant of the "triangle" inversion technique leveraging on the strengths and synergies of SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission) microwave observations and geostationary optical/infrared data. The SSM retrieval technique allows for: i) enhancing the spatial resolution of SMOS SSM product estimates to 3 km spatial resolution, and, ii) providing a temporal average daytime SM product from the instantaneous fine-scale SSM estimates acquired every 15 min; the latter is allowing higher coverage in presence of clouds and representativeness (up to 96 estimates per day) in comparison to the instantaneous estimate at the time of satellite overpass.
   The proposed technique has been implemented to SMOS and MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) observations acquired over the Iberian Peninsula and Southern France during year 2011. SSM instantaneous estimates at the time of SMOS overpass and daytime-averaged SSM estimates have been obtained and evaluated separately against collocated in-situ measurements acquired from a total of 40 stations belonging to the REMEDHUS, VAS and SMOSMANIA permanent soil moisture measurement networks. Statistical agreement between compared datasets has been evaluated both at individual stations and considering the network average on the basis of several statistical terms computed including correlation, bias, root-mean-squared errors, slope and intercept of linear regression. Results showed that the proposed method not only preserves the quality of SMOS SSM at finer spatial scales, but also allows achieving higher temporal coverage and representativeness in daytime averages. The synergy of SMOS and SEVIRI provides a pathway to enhance water cycle EO capabilities taking full advantage of the new observational records of SSM and operational geostationary information.

AB Five years of SMOS L-band brightness temperature data intercepting a large number of tropical cyclones (TCs) are analyzed. The storm-induced half-power radio-brightness contrast (Delta I) is defined as the difference between the brightness observed at a specific wind force and that for a smooth water surface with the same physical parameters. Delta I can be related to surface wind speed and has been estimated for-300 TCs that intercept with SMOS measurements. Delta I, expressed in a common storm-centric coordinate system, shows that mean brightness contrast monotonically increases with increased storm intensity ranging from similar to 5 K for strong storms to similar to 24 K for the most intense Category 5 TCs. A remarkable feature of the 2D mean Delta I fields and their variability is that maxima are systematically found on the right quadrants of the storms in the storm-centered coordinate frame, consistent with the reported asymmetric structure of the wind and wave fields in hurricanes. These results highlight the strong potential of SMOS measurements to improve monitoring of TC intensification and evolution. An improved empirical geophysical model function (GMF) was derived using a large ensemble of co-located SMOS Delta I, aircraft and H*WIND (a multi-measurement analysis) surface wind speed data. The GMF reveals a quadratic relationship between Delta I and the surface wind speed at a height of 10 m (U-10). ECMWF and NCEP analysis products and SMOS derived wind speed estimates are compared to a large ensemble of H*WIND 2D fields. This analysis confirms that the surface wind speed in TCs can effectively be retrieved from SMOS data with an RMS error on the order of 10 kt up to 100 kt. SMOS wind speed products above hurricane force (64 kt) are found to be more accurate than those derived from NWP analyses products that systematically underestimate the surface wind speed in these extreme conditions. Using co-located estimates of rain rate, we show that the L-band radio-brightness contrasts could be weakly affected by rain or ice-phase clouds and further work is required to refine the GMF in this context.

AB The use of satellite-derived classification maps to improve post-stratified forest parameter estimates is well established. When reducing the variance of post-stratification estimates for forest change parameters such as forest growth, it is logical to use a change-related strata map. At the stand level, a time series of Landsat images is ideally suited for producing such a map. In this study, we generate strata maps based on trajectories of Landsat Thematic Mapper-based normalized difference vegetation index values, with a focus on post-disturbance recovery and recent measurements. These trajectories, from 1985 to 2010, are converted to harmonic regression coefficient estimates and classified according to a hierarchical clustering algorithm from a training sample. The resulting strata maps are then used in conjunction with measured plots to estimate forest status and change parameters in an Alabama, USA study area. These estimates and the variance of the estimates are then used to calculate the estimated relative efficiencies of the post-stratified estimates. Estimated relative efficiencies around or above 1.2 were observed for total growth, total mortality, and total removals, with different strata maps being more effective for each. Possible avenues for improvement of the approach include the following: (1) enlarging the study area and (2) using the Landsat images closest to the time of measurement for each plot. Multitemporal satellite-derived strata maps show promise for improving the precision of change parameter estimates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation dynamics in the Kilimanjaro region, Tanzania, are subject to (i) global climate change and (ii) local land-cover change resulting from natural or anthropogenic disturbance. While recent climate models predict rising temperatures over East Africa throughout the 21st century, effects of land-use change on the local-scale water budget and, related therewith, on vegetation response are much more diverse. In addition, sea surface temperature anomalies in the Pacific (El Nino Southern Oscillation, ENSO) and Indian Ocean (Indian Ocean Dipole, IOD) are known to severely impact rainfall patterns and vegetation activity in the study area and possibly reinforce each other. Here we present long-term and seasonal vegetation dynamics derived from a GIMMS-based NDVI record resampled to 1 km spatial resolution and covering a 30-year period (1982-2011). In the long term, most of the upper mountain regions showed positive trends which was mainly attributed to vegetation recovery after disastrous fires during the outgoing 20th century. Along the western mountainside, by contrast, strong negative trends emerged as a consequence of fire-driven downward migration of Erica bush along the upper slopes and massive land conversion processes affecting the lower slopes. On the seasonal scale, a strong dependence of the regional vegetation on the effects of ENSO/IOD teleconnections became evident. Similar to previous findings on rainfall, the most beneficial effects occurred during concurrent El Nino/IOD events, while the impacts of La Nina were far less pronounced. To sum up, the newly created 1-km NDVI record proved capable of capturing long-term and seasonal vegetation patterns, which particularly applies for large-scale teleconnections, and thus provides an invaluable archive of decadal-scale vegetation dynamics in the study area.

AB Although prior studies have suggested that both landscape composition and configuration significantly affect land surface temperature (LST), the hierarchical effects of these landscape metrics on LST have been neglected because of the use of single-level models. With the analysis of remote sensing images of Zhuhai city in Southern China, this study incorporates multilevel models to estimate the hierarchical effects of landscape composition and configuration on LST. Comparisons of the single-level ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model and the multilevel models show four findings. First, LST is influenced by both level-one effects of composition (pixels) and level-two effects of configuration (groups of pixels). Second, multilevel models outperform OLS model in accounting for the LST-landscape relationships as the former produces the better fitting results and the smaller residuals and autocorrelations than the latter. Third, configuration metrics account for greater variability in LST than composition metrics. Fourth, the effects of configuration metrics vary across the level-two groups. The findings of this study provide new insights into the landscape influences on LST, and suggest that for mitigating urban heat island effects, optimizing the configurations of land cover types in urban areas should be considered because of the larger cooling effect of landscape configurations than compositions on LST.

AB Environmental monitoring with satellite data is facilitated by frequent observations at a fine spatial scale. As land surface temperature (LST) is one environmental key variable, we implemented a random forest (RF) regression approach to increase the spatial resolution of LST maps from similar to 1 km, routinely available in daily repetition from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), to similar to 250 m. LST was downscaled based on its relationship to topographic variables derived from digital elevation data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), land cover data (MODIS product MCD12Q1), and surface reflectances in the visible red and near infrared, which both are provided with the MODIS/Terra daily product MODO9GQ at similar to 250 m resolution. The approach was tested for a complex landscape in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Jordan River Region, with LST fields from aggregated Landsat-7 ETM + and MODIS (MODIS/Terra LST product MOD11A1) data; as reference at the finer scale, we used Landsat-7 derived LST data. For the ideal-case scenario with both degraded and reference values from the same sensor (Landsat-7 ETM +), root mean square errors (RMSE) of downscaled LSTs ranged from 1.02 K to 1.43 K for six different acquisition dates. When compared to the widely-adopted and in parallel applied TsHARP sharpening method, that is based on the relationship between NDVI and LST, downscaling accuracy with RF improved up to 19%. Applying the RF approach to MODIS LST products yielded RMSEs from 1.41 K to 1.92 K, whereas the TsHARP method and also a uniform disaggregation by resampling provided only slightly worse results. For the real MODIS LST product, downscaling with RF was affected by lower thermal contrasts in the image data that hindered an adequate training to reproduce temperature variations at the finer scale of similar to 250 m. In this context, we assume the LST product of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument (as a successor of MODIS onboard the SUOMI NPP platform) to be a better candidate for downscaling, as it provides a spatial resolution of similar to 750 m. One advantage of the RF approach is that predictor datasets can easily be adapted to data availability. In an extended RF approach with all Landsat spectral bands, downscaling results for formerly aggregated Landsat data improved distinctly and now ranged from 0.98 K to 1.33 K. This approach is also promising for the downscaling of real MODIS or VIIRS LST data as it may be combined with already available reflective data fusion models that are able to blend Landsat data and sensor data with a coarse spatial resolution (given spectral bandwidths corresponding to Landsat) to generate temporally dense synthetic Landsat time series.

AB Antarctica's ice shelves, the floating extensions of the ice sheet, exert an important dynamic constraint on the flow of ice from the grounded ice sheet to the ocean and, therefore, on changes in global sea level. Thinning of an ice shelf reduces its ability to restrain the ice discharge from the grounded ice sheet. However, our understanding of how ice shelf processes couple ice-sheet changes to climate variability is still rudimentary. In part, this is due to the brevity and low temporal resolution of surveys of ice shelf thickness relative to the broad range of time scales on which ice-sheet mass fluctuates. Here, we present improved procedures to construct 18-year (1994-2012) time series of Antarctic ice shelf surface height at high spatial resolution (similar to 30 km) by merging data from three overlapping satellite radar altimeter missions (ERS-1, ERS-2, and Envisat). We apply an averaging scheme to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of height changes over the floating ice shelves, and extract low-order polynomial trends using a robust approach (regularized regression with cross-validation) that accounts for both bias and variance in the fit. We construct formal confidence intervals by bootstrap resampling of the residuals of the fit. The largest source of height error arises from the interaction of the radar signal with the snow and firn surface; on annual time scales, changes in surface and sub-surface scattering and radar penetration lead to apparent height changes that are larger than the true surface-height change arising from densification. Our 18-year time series of surface height provide an insight into how ice shelves respond to the changing atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Our methods could also be applied to grounded portions of the ice sheets, both in Antarctica and Greenland. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this study was to develop an inversion approach to estimate surface soil moisture from X-band SAR data over irrigated grassland areas. This approach simulates a coupling scenario between Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images through the Water Cloud Model (WCM). A time series of SAR (TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed) and optical (SPOT 4/5 and LANDSAT 7/8) images were acquired over an irrigated grassland region in southeastern France.
   An inversion technique based on multi-layer perceptron neural networks (NNs) was used to invert the Water Cloud Model (WCM) for soil moisture estimation. Three inversion configurations based on SAR and optical images were defined: (1) HH polarization, (2) HV polarization, and (3) both HH and HV polarizations, all with one vegetation descriptor derived from optical data. The investigated vegetation descriptors were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index "NDVI", Leaf Area Index "LAI", Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation "FAPAR", and the Fractional vegetation COVER "FCOVER". These vegetation descriptors were derived from optical images. For the three inversion configurations, the NNs were trained and validated using a noisy synthetic dataset generated by the WCM for a wide range of soil moisture and vegetation descriptor values. The trained NNs were then validated from a real dataset composed of X-band SAR backscattering coefficients and vegetation descriptor derived from optical images. The use of X-band SAR measurements in HH polarization (in addition to one vegetation descriptor derived from optical images) yields more precise results on soil moisture (My) estimates. In the case of NDVI derived from optical images as the vegetation descriptor, the Root Mean Square Error on My estimates was 3.6 Vol.% for NDVI values between 0.45 and 0.75, and 6.1 Vol.% for NDVI between 0.75 and 0.90. Similar results were obtained regardless of the other vegetation descriptor used. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the influence of forest structure on forest albedo, and thus on the energy exchange between the forest and the atmosphere, is urgently needed in areas with large forest cover and active forest management. Fine resolution albedo retrievals enable quantifying the relationships between forest variables and albedo also in patchy landscapes, such as in the managed forests in Fennoscandia. In this study, field plot data, airborne laser scanning (ALS) data and high resolution satellite albedo retrievals from Landsat were used to investigate the main factors influencing forest albedo in Central Finland in midsummer. Tree species, forest structure and under story (ground) vegetation composition all influenced forest albedo. The tree species-specific models were estimated on a subpixel scale by utilizing information on the proportions of each species within a plot. Tree species considerably improved the albedo prediction when added to a model containing only a structural variable, whereas a further addition of the site fertility class as a proxy of understory vegetation composition only slightly improved the model. Albedo decreased with increasing volume of growing stock, but the decrease leveled off at high volumes. The albedo of plots with high volume was instead mainly governed by tree species and was the lowest for Norway spruce, intermediate for Scots pine and highest for broadleaved species. Norway spruce albedo decreased almost linearly with increasing mean tree height. ALS-derived canopy cover explained fairly well the variation in albedo in the visible region, but the total shortwave albedo was better predicted by ALS-derived tree height. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Post-fire snags provide important resources for cavity nesting communities as well as being subject to timber removal through salvage logging practices. Tools that can characterize their distributions along with other features important as wildlife habitat, such as woody shrub cover, would be useful for research and management purposes. Three dimensional lidar data and Landsat time series disturbance products have both shown varying promise in their ability to characterize aspects of dead biomass and understory cover, but studies exploring the combination of the remote sensing datasets calibrated with field data to model difficult to map habitat components are limited. The purpose of this study was to 1) relate lidar and Landsat time series products to field collected calibration data to produce maps of important post-fire wildlife habitat components including snags of varying sizes and the availability of a woody shrub layer; and 2) compare the individual performance of the Landsat and lidar datasets for predicting the distributions of these difficult to map forest habitat features Using 164 field calibration plots and remote sensing predictors, we modeled and mapped the distributions of our response variables including snag classes (dbh >= 40 cm; >= 50 cm, and >= 75 cm) and woody shrub cover thresholds (>= 30 and >= 50% cover) at 10 m resolutions. Remote sensing predictors included various lidar structure and topography variables and Landsat time series products representing the pre-fire forest, disturbance magnitude, and current forest condition. A model was chosen for mapping purposes using AIC model selection and then by comparing leave-one-out-cross-validation error matrices to choose among competing models. We were able to predict and map all response variables with moderate accuracies and variable sensitivity (true positive) and specificity (true negative) rates. All snag and shrub models were considered to have "good" predictive performance as indicated by area under the curve values (0.74-0.91), with percent correctly classified values ranging from 69-85% when a probability threshold is chosen that balances false positive and false negative errors. Landsat models performed marginally better than lidar structure models according to classification statistics. Landsat-only models had slightly less accuracy than models that included lidar and Landsat data, but often with greater errors than the combined model. The ability to map the response variables with moderate errors and acceptable accuracies for many applications was through the fusion of these remote sensing datasets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Large-scale ocean-atmospheric phenomena like the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have significant influence on Australia's precipitation variability. In this study, multi-linear regression (MLR) and complex empirical orthogonal function (CEOF) analyses were applied to isolate (i) the continental precipitation variations likely associated with ENSO and IOD, here referred to as 'ENSO/IOD mode', and (ii) the variability not associated with ENSO/IOD (the 'non-ENSO/IOD mode'). The first is of interest due to its dominant influence on inter-annual variability, while the second may reveal lower frequency variability or trends. Precipitation products used for this study included gridded rainfall estimates derived by interpolation of rain gauge data from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM), two satellite remote sensing products (CHIRP and TRMM TMPA version 7), and two weather forecast model re-analysis products (ERA-Interim and MERRA). The products covered the period 1981-2014 except TMPA (1998-2014). Statistical and frequency-based inter-comparisons were performed to evaluate the seasonal and long-term skills of various rainfall products against the BoM product. The results indicate that linear trends in rainfall during 1981-2014 were largely attributable to ENSO and IOD. Both intra-annual and seasonal rainfall changes associated with ENSO and IOD increased from 1991 to 2014. Among the continent's 13 major river basins, the greatest precipitation variations associated with ENSO/IOD were found over the Northern and North East Coast, while the smallest contributions were for Tasmania and the South West Coast basins. We also found that although the assessed products show comparable spatial variability of rainfall over Australia, systematic seasonal differences exist that were more pronounced during the ENSO and IOD events.

AB The trade-off between the temporal and spatial resolutions, and/or the influence of cloud cover, makes it difficult to obtain continuous fine-scale satellite data for surface urban heat island (SUHI) analysis. To relieve these difficulties, this study employs multi-temporal and multi-sensor fusion methods for a long-term and fine-scale summer SUHI analysis of the city of Wuhan in China. By integrating several series of satellite images, we generated 26-year (1988 to 2013) high spatial resolution (Landsat-like) summer land surface temperature (LST) data. This series of data was then used for a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the SUHI patterns, evolution characteristics, and mechanisms. This study not only provides a generalized research framework for the long-term and fine-scale analysis of the SUHI effect, but also reveals several findings about the heat distribution and SUHI characteristics in Wuhan. Firstly, our results show that the high temperature and sub-high temperature areas were continuously concentrated from rural to urban areas, but the high temperature area within the old city zones showed an obvious decreasing tendency. Secondly, a more important finding is that the SUHI intensity first increased and then decreased over the 26 years. The maximum temperature difference between the city zone and the rural area was in 2003 (7.19 K for the old city zone, and 4.65 K for the area within the third ring road). Finally, we confirm that the relationships between heat distribution and land cover (especially vegetation and impervious surfaces) were interannually stable, and that the influences of industry, businesses, and residential districts on the SUHI effect were in descending order in Wuhan.

AB We examine the potential for parameterizing a two-dimensional (2D) land data assimilation system using spatial error auto-correlation statistics gleaned from a triple collocation analysis and the triplet of: (1) active microwave-, (2) passive microwave- and (3) land surface model-based surface soil moisture products. Results demonstrate that, while considerable spatial error auto-correlation exists in the errors for all three products, the inclusion of this information into a 2D assimilation system does not significantly improve the performance of the system relative to a one-dimensional (1D) baseline. This result is explained via an analytical evaluation of the impact of spatial error auto-correlation on the steady-state Kalman gain, which reveals that 2D filtering requires the existence of large auto-correlation differences (between the assimilation model and the assimilated observations) in order to enhance the analysis relative to a 1D filtering baseline. As a result, large error auto-correlations alone (in both the model or observations) are not sufficient to motivate the application of a 2D land assimilation system. These results have important consequences for the development of land data assimilation systems designed to ingest satellite derived surface soil moisture products for water resource and climate applications.

AB This study extends the popular triple collocation method for error assessment from three source estimates to an arbitrary number of source estimates, i.e., to solve the "multiple" collocation problem. Past efforts on multiple collocation fall short of delivering a well-defined, well-interpreted and unique solution thus may result in inconsistent conclusions. Here the error assessment problem is solved through Pythagorean constraints in Hilbert space, which is slightly different from the original inner product solution but allows us to define a unique solution to the multiple collocation. The Pythagorean solution is fully equivalent to the original inner product solution for the triple collocation case. The multiple collocation turns out to be an over-constrained problem and a least squares solution is presented. As the most critical assumption of uncorrelated errors will surely fail in most multiple collocation problems, we propose to divide the source estimates into structural groups based on their production process and treat the structural and non-structural errors separately. Such error separation allows the source estimates to have their structural errors fully correlated within the same structural group, which is much more realistic than the original assumption. A new error assessment procedure is developed which performs the collocation twice, each for one type of errors (structural and non-structural), and then sums up the two types of errors. The new procedure is also fully backward compatible with the original triple collocation technique. Error assessment experiments are carried out for surface soil moisture data from multiple remote sensing models, land surface models, and in situ measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Fires affect wide areas and their effects can be successfully estimated from a range of remote sensing sensors, with synthetic aperture radars (SAR) being of particular interest due to their sensitivity to forest vertical structure, global availability and independence of cloud cover or solar elevation. Previous studies have demonstrated the sensitivity to fire effects of L-band SAR sensors using post-fire datasets and empirical modeling. This study proposed an innovative method for estimating fire severity by combining pre- and post-fire SAR datasets within a change detection framework to compute a novel index, the Radar Bum Ratio (RBR). More importantly, a standardized RBR was developed and tested over seven temperate forest types located on three continents with above ground biomass values ranging from 30 to over 500 t ha(-1). RBR standardization allowed for common thresholds to be defined and subsequently used for estimating the Composite Burn Index (CBI, a measure of fire impact) without the need for a priori information (i.e., in situ data) on local post-fire conditions. The estimation accuracy of the standardized RBR was compared to locally-calibrated empirical models based on field CBI data. The results showed similar estimation errors and a strong agreement with the reference in situ data (i.e., Cohen's weighted kappa >0.61). The RBR index most sensitive to fire severity was based on the cross-polarized channel applied under dry environmental conditions. Under wet conditions the estimation accuracy was considerably lower. The methods proposed in this study are particularly valuable for rapid fire severity assessments at regional to global scales, requiring only that RBR thresholds be calibrated for a range of environments and that CBI scores be related to fuel consumption for each forest type.

AB We used imaging spectroscopy to perform a top-down mesoscale analysis of tropical tree species richness across a bioclimatic gradient in Panama. The expressed precipitation gradient from the wet Caribbean side to the dry Pacific side makes Panama an excellent study area for performing a mesoscale assessment of climate effects on tropical tree species richness. Spatial patterns in local spectral variability (expressed as the coefficient of variation) and spectral similarity (expressed as the spectral similarity index) were used as proxies for species area curves and species distance decay curves. Our analysis revealed significant spectral changes along the precipitation gradient. Highest spectral diversity was observed for moist forest sites while lowest diversity was observed for the driest forest sites. Most of the spectral variation came from changes in the visible (VIS) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) reflectance. Variation in the VIS was significantly higher for the dry compared to the moist and wet forests, while the opposite was true for the NIR and SWIR reflectance. Our spectral mesoscale analysis extends previous results suggesting that niche differentiation with respect to soil water availability is a direct determinant of both local- and regional-scale distributions of tropical trees. A next step would be to test the accuracy and scalability of our results with lower spatial resolution spectrometer data, simulating the observing conditions that will be achieved with future satellite missions such as the European Union's EnMap and NASA's HyspIRI missions.

AB Tidal wetlands are highly productive and act as critical habitat for a wide variety of plants, fish, shellfish, and other wildlife. These ecotones between aquatic and terrestrial environments also provide protection from storm damage, run-off filtering, and recharge of aquifers. Many wetlands along coasts have been exposed to stress-inducing alterations globally, including dredge and fill operations, hydrologic modifications, pollutants, impoundments, fragmentation by roads/ditches, and sea level rise. For wetland protection and sensible coastal development, there is a need to monitor these ecosystems at global and regional scales. Recent advances in satellite sensor design and data analysis are providing practical methods for monitoring natural and man-made changes in wetlands. However, available satellite remote sensors have been limited to mapping primarily wetland location and extent. This paper describes how the HyspIRI hyperspectral and thermal infrared sensors can be used to study and map key ecological properties, such as species composition, biomass, hydrology, and evapotranspiration of tidal salt and brackish marshes and mangroves, and perhaps other major wetland types, including freshwater marshes and wooded/shrub wetlands.

AB This paper presents an improved algorithm for the retrieval of Leaf Area Index (LA!) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery that has been specifically customized for mountain grasslands in the Alps. The main features of the proposed algorithm, which is based on the inversion of a radiative transfer model, are: i) a higher spatial resolution (250 m) with respect to the corresponding standard MODIS product and ii) tuning the model to the spectral characteristics of mountain grasslands.
   To quantify the effects of the features of the proposed algorithm, the approach is first applied to a MODIS reflectance data time series from 2007 up-scaled to a 1 km spatial resolution for better comparison with the standard MODIS LAI product. In the next step, the benefit of the higher spatial resolution is assessed by applying the algorithm to a series of MODIS satellite images with a spatial resolution of 250 m acquired over the central Alps in the period 2005-2007. LAI estimates were validated for both temporal consistency and accuracy using ground measurement time series collected at three different study sites in the investigated area. The results obtained demonstrate the capability of the proposed algorithm to follow the expected temporal and range dynamics of LAI in this challenging environment, showing an overall RMSE accuracy of 1.68 (m(2)/m(2)). This approach thus opens a promising avenue for the exploitation of moderate resolution satellite data for novel and more accurate monitoring studies at a regional scale in mountain environments.

AB In the western United States snow has been melting earlier in recent decades due to warmer winter and spring weather. This is particularly noticeable in the Pacific Northwest and coastal areas, yet has been less obvious in locations farther inland. Using the historical Landsat image archive, snow cover was mapped in the Wind River Range (WRR) in northwestern Wyoming, from 1972-2013. The objective of this work was to estimate the temporal change in the rate of snowmelt in the Fremont Lake basin of the WRR for the 42-year study period. Much of the streamflow in Wyoming originates from melting snow in the WRR. Streamflow is a significant contributor to the water resources for the north-central part of the state and has tremendous societal and economic impacts especially during the prolonged drought that is affecting the western U.S. Consistent with the ongoing and severe drought, data from the Pine Creek Above Fremont Lake gauge show a striking reduction in cumulative stream discharge in the 2000s vs. the decades of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Snow-cover depletion curves derived from snow maps created from Landsat imagery were generated for the period 1972-2013. MODerate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived standard snow-cover maps were also used to generate snow-cover depletion curves, from 2000-2013, to provide an accuracy assessment of the Landsat technique. Landsat-derived mean snow-cover depletion curves from 2000-2013 and from the three previous decades, show that snow cover in the Fremont lake basin is melting 16 +/- 10 days earlier, on average, in the 2000s compared to the period from 1972-1999. Increasing spring and summer nighttime air temperature is the likely driver of the earlier snowmelt documented in the Landsat record. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The trans-Atlantic dust transport has important implications for human and ecosystem health, the terrestrial and oceanic biogeochemical cycle, weather systems, and climate. This study provides an observation-based multiyear estimate of trans-Atlantic dust transport using a 7-year (2007-2013) record of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) measurements of the three dimensional distribution of aerosol backscatter, extinction and depolarization ratio in both cloud-free and above-cloud conditions. We estimate that on a basis of the 7-year average and integration over 10 degrees S-30 degrees N, 182 Tg a(-1) dust leaves the coast of North Africa at 15 degrees W, of which 132 Tg a(-1) and 43 Tg a(-1) reaches 35 degrees W and 75 degrees W, respectively. These flux estimates have an overall known uncertainty of (45-70)%. Because of lack of reliable observations, uncertainties associated with the diurnal variation of dust and the missing below-cloud dust cannot be quantified. Significant seasonal variations are observed in both the magnitude of total dust mass flux and its meridional and vertical distributions. The interannual variability of annual dust mass flux is highly anti-correlated with the prior-year Sahel Precipitation Index. Using only cloud-free aerosol observations to calculate dust mass flux could introduce a high bias when compared with all-sky conditions that include both cloud-free and above-cloud aerosol observations. The bias is about 20% at 35 degrees W and 75 degrees W in boreal winter and spring based on the 7-year average, as long as dust within and below low-level clouds is negligible.

AB Albedo products from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have been validated extensively over spatially homogeneous sites with snow-cover. This study evaluated the spatial scaling of albedo and related reflectance-based quantities over areas of high spatial heterogeneity in temperate mixed forest, deciduous forest, urban and built-up, and cropland/natural mosaic lands under snow covered conditions. Reflectance-based quantities evaluated included spectral radiance, surface directional reflectance, and spectral and broadband albedo derived from ground- and tower-based measurements and high-resolution (5 m) hyperspectral imagery (HSI) to coarse resolution (similar to 500 m) MODIS satellite data.
   Our approach first compared ground- and tower-based spectral and broadband reflectance quantities to HSI data, then to evaluate HSI with MODIS reflectance-based products. Over snow-covered pasture, HSI directional reflectance was biased lower than ground-based measurements collected using a spectroradiometer, and greatly underestimated at wavelengths less than 450 nm. Tower-based shortwave broadband albedo (280-2800 nm) and HSI albedo agreed within +/- 0.04. HSI directional spectral reflectance agreed well with tower-based measurements of spectral albedo collected using a spectroradiometer and remote cosine receptor above a mixed forest canopy with underlying snow cover. Spectral albedo collected over a dormant deciduous broadleaf canopy increased from 0.10 for snow-free conditions to 0.14-0.18 when snow-cover was present under the canopy. Canopy shortwave broadband albedo was not very sensitive to underlying snowpack depth, indicative of strong vegetation masking.
   Next, HSI data were spatially aggregated and averaged to 500 m MODIS grids and compared to two MODIS albedo products: (1) MODIS/Terra and Aqua Combined Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) Albedo V005 (MCD43A, magnitude inversion), and (2) MODIS/Ferra Snow Cover Daily 13 Global 500 m Grid (MOD10A1). An assessment of surface heterogeneity demonstrated that MODIS products generally perform well for snow-covered landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity, with biases between +/- 0.04 and RMSEs less than 0.085 for mixed and deciduous broadleaf forested and urban & built-up land cover classes, and less than 0.11 for cropland/natural mosaic. Biases were generally lower for MOD10A1 compared to MCD43A3.
   Mean shortwave broadband albedo from MODIS and HSI over deciduous broadleaf and mixed forest with underlying snow cover ranged from 0.14 to 028. Albedo over MODIS grids characterized as a mosaic of cropland, forests, grasslands, and shrublands (e.g., cropland/natural mosaic) was substantially higher than forested grids under snow-covered conditions, ranging from 039 to 0.43.

AB Improved maximum cross correlation (MCC) techniques are used to retrieve ocean surface currents from the sequential ocean color imagery provided by multiple newer generations of satellite sensors on hourly scales in the Yellow Sea and the U.S. East and Gulf coasts. The MCC calculation is validated in a series of Bio-Optical Forecasting (BioCast) experiments with predetermined synthetic velocities, and its products are evaluated by examining the errors and biases with respect to the High Frequency Radar (HFRadar) measurements. The root-mean-square (RMS) errors in our best current products derived from the overlap of satellite sensor swath between the VIIRS sequential orbits are less than 0.17 m s(-1) in the evaluation area outside of the Chesapeake Bay. The most accurate current products are those derived from the imagery data of R-rs(551), B-b(551) and C(551), while the image sequences of B-b(551) and Z(eu)_lee are identified as the most suited products for the retrieval of currents because of their best production capacities of valid velocity vectors. Mechanisms between the advective processes and the dynamic changes of bio-optical properties are discussed regarding the performances of various color products on the retrieval of currents. Similarities of velocity distribution in the retrieved vector arrays are collected across different MCC products derived from ocean color datasets that are of different types and derived from different spectral channels of satellite overpasses. The inter-product similarities themselves can be used to characterize the near-surface advection as well and usually have smaller errors than each of the individual MCC currents. Moreover, efforts are also under way to improve the ocean color derived currents by merging several of the MCC products with similarities to increase the total spatial coverage. This study not only seeks the image-derived products best representing the sea surface current structures in coastal areas, but also exploits how these currents can be improved or optimized to support the ocean forecasts.

AB Mountain pine beetles are significant forest disturbance agents, capable of inducing widespread mortality in coniferous forests in western North America. Various remote sensing approaches have assessed the impacts of beetle outbreaks over the last two decades. However, few studies have addressed the impacts of historical mountain pine beetle outbreaks, including the 1970s event that impacted Glacier National Park. The lack of spatially explicit data on this disturbance represents both a major data gap and a critical research challenge in that wildfire has removed some of the evidence from the landscape. We utilized multiple lines of evidence to model forest canopy mortality as a proxy for outbreak severity. We incorporate historical aerial and landscape photos, aerial detection survey data, a nine-year collection of satellite imagery and abiotic data. This study presents a remote sensing based framework to (1) relate measurements of canopy mortality from fine-scale aerial photography to coarse-scale multispectral imagery and (2) classify the severity of mountain pine beetle affected areas using a temporal sequence of Landsat data and other landscape variables. We sampled canopy mortality in 261 plots from aerial photos and found that insect effects on mortality were evident in changes to the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over time. We tested multiple spectral indices and found that a combination of NDVI and the green band resulted in the strongest model. We report a two-step process where we utilize a generalized least squares model to account for the large-scale variability in the data and a binary regression tree to describe the small-scale variability. The final model had a root mean square error estimate of 9.8% canopy mortality, a mean absolute error of 7.6% and an R-2 of 0.82. The results demonstrate that a model of percent canopy mortality as a continuous variable can be developed to identity a gradient of mountain pine beetle severity on the landscape.

AB This study intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) time series mosaics for automatic detection of tropical deforestation in Riau province, Indonesia. Using six time series PALSAR mosaics, the characteristics of HH and HV gamma nought (gamma(0)) in natural forests and deforested areas from 2007 to 2010 and the accuracy of deforestation detection by using a threshold were investigated. We obtained the following results: (1) Applying a simple thresholding method to time series differences of gamma(0)(HV) was effective for fully automatic detection of deforestation areas. When we used a fixed threshold, the accuracy ranged from 72% to 96% (average of 87%). (2) gamma(0)(HH) did not always show systematic changes after deforestation. (3) The temporal variation of gamma(0) for deforested areas was larger than that for natural forests. These variations in gamma(0) were correlated with 10-day accumulated precipitation. High accumulated precipitation decreased the gamma(0) difference between deforested areas and natural forests, causing decreased accuracy of deforestation detection. (4) Integration of the results from two different dates in a given year can reduce the detection error due to time variations and provide highly accurate results (average accuracy of 91%, minimum of 82%). The accuracy values quoted except hilly areas, shadow, and lay-over. The proposed method is effective for detection of deforestation larger than 1 ha. The deforestation mapping method proposed in the study can be utilized for assessment of yearly changes in forested areas and is useful for tracking changes in forest cover on large scales.

AB A number of acquisition constellations for airborne or spaceborne optical images involve small time-lags and produce near-simultaneous images, a type of data which has thus far been little exploited to detect or quantify target motion at the Earth's surface. These time-lag constellations were for the most part not even meant to exhibit motion tracking capabilities, or these capabilities were considered a drawback In this contribution, we give the first systematic overview of the methods and issues involved in exploiting near-simultaneous airborne and satellite acquisitions. We first cover the category of the near-simultaneous acquisitions produced by individual stereo sensors, typically designed for topographic mapping, with a time-lag on the order of a minute. Over this time period, we demonstrate that the movement of river ice debris, sea ice floes or suspended sediments can be tracked, and we estimate the corresponding water surface velocity fields. Similarly, we assess cloud motion vector fields and vehicle trajectories. A second category of near-simultaneous acquisitions, with much smaller time-lags of at most a few seconds, is associated with along-track offsets of detector lines in the focal plane of pushbroom systems. These constellations are demonstrated here to be suitable to detect motion of fast vehicles, such as cars and airplanes, or, for instance, ocean waves. Acquisition delays are, third, also produced by other constellations such as 'trains' of satellites following each other and leading to time-lags of minutes to tens of minutes, which are in this contribution used to track icebergs and features of floating ice crystals on the sea, and an algae bloom. For all acquisition categories, the higher the spatial resolution of the data and the longer the time-lag, the smaller the minimum speed that can be detected. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB To estimate the daily concentration of ground-level PM2.5 coincident to satellite overpass at regional scale, a satellite-based geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was developed. The model enhances PM2.5 estimation accuracy by considering spatial variation and nonstationarity that might introduce significant biases into PM2.5 estimation. The model was evaluated and validated against the PM2.5 data collected over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China for the period of May 2012 to September 2013. The evaluation evidenced that, with meteorological parameters assimilated, the GWR model is able to explain 73.8% of the variability in ground-level PM2.5 concentration, a better performance than the two conventional statistical models (a general linear regression model Model-I, 56.4% and a semi-empirical model Model-II, 52.6%, respectively). The vertical correction on satellite-derived AOD and relative humidity significantly improve the AOD-PM2.5 correlative relationship. The findings from the study demonstrated the great potential and value of the GWR model for regional PM2.5 estimation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) and canopy vertical profiles are important descriptors of ecosystem structure. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on board ICESat (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite) provided three-dimensional observations that can be used to derive these canopy structure parameters globally. While several canopy height products have been produced globally from GLAS, no comparable data sets for LAI and canopy profiles exist across large areas. In this study we develop a physically based method of retrieving LAI and vertical foliage profiles (VFPs) from GLAS observations over the entire state of California, USA. This method refines lidar derived LAI and VFP through a recursive analysis of GLAS waveforms using ancillary data obtained from existing remote sensing products. Those supplemental inputs include canopy clumping index derived from POLDER, 500 m land cover type and 1 km LAI data derived from MODIS. Implementation of our method created state-level LAI and VFP data for the existing GIAS transects over California. We then analyzed the variability of LAI and VFP data sets across environmental gradients and as a function of land cover type and elevation. Both LAI and VFP showed strong variability across elevational gradients and among land cover types. We compared our results at the scale of GLAS footprints with an LAI map derived from Landsat (at 30 m) and found moderate agreement (r(2) = 034, bias = 0.26, RMSD (Root Mean Square Difference) = 1.85) between the two. In particular, Landsat LAI not only appeared to saturate relative to GLAS LAI at around LAI = 5, but also showed an overestimation for LAI less than about 2. Best agreement between the two LAI data sets was shown to occur in areas with slope less than 20 degrees. Results from our study suggest the possibility of retrieving global LAI and VFP data from GIAS data and the potential for synergetic observation of lidar and passive optical remote sensing data such as Landsat.

AB Accurate inventories of grasslands are important for studies of carbon dynamics, biodiversity conservation and agricultural management. For regions with persistent cloud cover the use of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data provides an attractive solution for generating up-to-date inventories of grasslands. This is even more appealing considering the data that will be available from upcoming missions such as Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2. In this study, the performance of three machine learning algorithms; Random Forests (RE), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the relatively underused Extremely Randomised Trees (ERT) is evaluated for discriminating between grassland types over two large heterogeneous areas of Ireland using multi-temporal, multi-sensor radar and ancillary spatial datasets. A detailed accuracy assessment shows the efficacy of the three algorithms to classify different types of grasslands. Overall accuracies >= 88.7% (with kappa coefficient of 0.87) were achieved for the single frequency classifications and maximum accuracies of 97.9% (kappa coefficient of 0.98) for the combined frequency classifications. For most datasets, the ERT classifier outperforms SVM and RE. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Offshore wind data derived from satellite measurements (CCMP, QuikSCAT, NCDC Blended Sea Winds and IFREMER Blended Wind Fields), reanalyses (NCEP-CFSR, ERA-Interim, NASA-MERRA and NCEP-RII), analyses (NCEP-FNL and NCEP-GFS) and WRF modelled offshore winds were compared to in situ measurements, in order to assess which one of these products is the best alternative to in situ offshore measured wind data. Wind speed and direction from these products were compared to measurements collected at five buoys moored along the Iberian Peninsula Atlantic coast.
   Results show that WRF modelled offshore winds are the best alternative to in situ measured offshore wind data, showing the highest temporal accuracy (the ability in representing the wind speed and direction at a given time instant) and lowest errors in terms of offshore wind power flux estimations. However, offshore wind data taken from CCMP shows the lowest errors in terms of the mean wind speeds and, together with IFREMER-BWF, the best wind temporal accuracy after WRF simulation. Therefore, in general CCMP and IFREMER-BWF can be considered as the best alternatives to WRF high resolution modelled offshore winds, if the latter is not available. Specifically for offshore wind energy resource assessment, NCEP-CFSR reanalysis or NCEP-GFS analysis data can also be used with confidence as an alternative to WRF modelled data, showing better wind power flux estimates than CCMP and IFREMER-BWF.
   Despite the best performances of WRF high resolution offshore winds, such modelling tasks require considerable computational resources and time to obtain quality results. Therefore, the value of satellite-derived wind data should not be disregarded. These remotely sensed offshore wind measurements should be seriously considered when searching for alternative sources of wind information for ocean areas, in particular for open ocean areas where they have their strength.

AB Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) instrument, and a radiative transfer model (RTM), we provide a quantitative assessment of regional cloud-free diurnally averaged shortwave Aerosol Radiative Effects (AREs) at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and at the surface over Southeast Asia (SEAS, 10 degrees S-20 N and 90 degrees E-130 degrees E). The spatial and temporal variations of the annual ARE are calculated based on satellite and ground-based measurements, supplemented by radiative transfer simulations. During 2001-2010, our results indicate that the TOA diurnally averaged ARE is -5.6 +/- 0.8 Wm(-2) over land and -4.8 +/- 0.7 Wm(-2) over ocean, respectively. In contrast, the surface ARE is -13.8 +/- 3.2 Wm(-2) based on radiative transfer calculations. For aerosol layers of 2 km in height with midvisible optical depth of 1.41 and single scattering albedo of 0.91, the shortwave radiative heating can exceed 0.8 K/day. Our results indicate significant inter-annual variability of aerosol radiative properties, which is extremely large over major emission outflow regions like SEAS. This study suggests that an integrated system of satellite data, model calculations coupled with ground-based and meteorological data sets is needed to assess Aerosol Radiative Effects on regional earth-atmosphere energy budgets.

AB Time series of monthly mean brightness temperatures over the tropical ocean (20 degrees S to 20 degrees N) measured under clear-sky condition by two Advance Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) radiometers onboard the polar-orbiting NOAA-18 and NOAA-19 satellites are investigated for the time period from 2009 to 2012. To demonstrate the characteristics of the data over this test site, time series of monthly mean ocean brightness temperatures are constructed separately for the ascending and descending passes. These time series provide a useful pattern of annual variation of the AMSU-A measurements for inter-calibration of microwave radiometers onboard multiple satellites to estimate the Intersatellite/intersensor Calibration Biases (ICBs) at individual channels. Differences (Delta T = T-N18 - T-N19) of monthly mean brightness temperatures (as denoted by T-N18 and TN19, respectively) between the NOAA-18 and NOAA-19 near-nadir measurements are used to estimate the ICBs at individual channels. It is found that the AT values distribute around individual ICBs with near zero slopes, except channel 8 which shows a noticeable anomalous trend in the AT time series. This abnormal behavior coincides with the degradation of the NOAA-19 noise equivalent delta temperatures (NE Delta Ts) which have greatly exceeded the AMSU-A specification since early 2010. This instrument problem is clearly detected in this study. Diurnal variations of the time series of data were corrected with a diurnal cycle of the measurements, which are modeled with a second-order Fourier series, from four AMSU-A radiometers onboard NOAA-15, -16, -18 and METOP-A, respectively. These four satellites have different local equator crossing times across the diurnal period. The results presented in this study will be useful for data users to have a better understanding of the measurements before using these AMSU-A data for weather forecasting or to create data sets for climate applications.

AB Surface solar irradiance (SSI) data are important for planning and estimating the production of solar power plants. Long-term high quality surface solar radiation data are needed for monitoring climate change. This paper presents a new surface solar irradiance dataset, the broadband (0.2-4 mu m) surface solar irradiance product derived from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The OMI SSI algorithm is based on the Heliosat method and uses the OMI O-2-O-2 cloud product as main input. The OMI SSI data are validated against the globally distributed Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) measurements at 19 stations for the year 2008. Furthermore, the monthly mean OMI SSI data are compared to independent surface solar irradiance products from International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Flux Data (ISCCP-FD) and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data for the year 2005. The mean difference between OMI SSI and BSRN global (direct + diffuse) irradiances is - 1.2W m(-2) (-0.2%), the root mean square error is 100.1 W m(-2) (18.1%), and the mean absolute error is 67.8W m(-2) (12.2%). The differences between OMI SSI and BSRN global irradiances are smaller over continental and coastal sites and larger over deserts and islands. OMI SSI has a good agreement with the CERES shortwave (SW) model B surface downward flux (SDF) product. The correlation coefficient and index of agreement between monthly mean 1-degree gridded OMI SSI and CERES SW SDF are >0.99. OMI SSI is lower than CERES SW SDF which is partly due to the solar zenith angle. On average, OMI SSI is 13.5 W m(-2) (2.5%) lower than the ISCCPFD SW surface downward flux and the correlation coefficient and index of agreement are >0.98 for every month. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB The relationship between boreal forest age and albedo in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave broadband was studied using MODIS and Landsat albedo retrievals and forest resource maps. The dependency of forest albedo on stand age was estimated from MODIS albedo retrievals using a linear unmixing approach combined with nonlinear regression. Exponential function was appropriate to describe the decline of coniferous forest albedo with stand age in all seasons and the decline of deciduous broadleaved albedo in winter. The effect of stand age on albedo was stronger for spruce than for pine, and the variation in albedo as a function of stand age was larger in winter than in summer for all species and wavelength regions. When applied to the test data, the albedo values predicted using the estimated age dependent albedo functions produced somewhat better results than when using only the species specific mean albedos as predictors. The tendency of the albedo values predicted using the age dependent functions towards the mean of the observed values suggested that the models did not cover all variation in the species specific forest albedos. A larger variation in the predicted albedos was obtained when age dependent albedo functions were estimated using Landsat albedo estimates. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

ID THICKNESS DISTRIBUTION; OCEAN; MELT; COVER
AB Since 2009, subsets of declassified satellite images of Arctic sea ice have been released as literal image derived products (LIDPs) with one-meter resolution for scientific use. The collections include imagery acquired over six fixed locations in the Arctic Basin since 1999. Targeted acquisitions over drifting ice parcels, from 2009 on, provide an added dimension to the LIDP archive. This mode of acquisition is especially useful for capturing time-varying processes during the melt season. In this paper, we describe the characteristics of LIDPs, the extent of the current archive, and highlight their uses for Arctic sea ice science. At this writing, the archive of LIDPs is still quite limited, and thus this paper illustrates the potential utility of the imagery. We provide an overview of the retrieval of five sea ice parameters that would benefit significantly from the surface details afforded by the higher resolution LIDPs. They include: melt pond coverage, open water fraction, ridge height, floe size, and, openings and closings. Two other uses are suggested: measurement of lateral melt and the interpretation of radar backscatter. The intent is to motivate geophysical uses of the LIDP and future acquisitions. Results here suggest that the effective observations of sea ice parameters and especially their changes require more focused sampling strategies to address specific spatial and temporal sampling needs. Presently, acquisitions of this type of imagery at fixed locations and drifting sites are being continued, and LIDPs are added to the archive as they are released.

AB GEographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) has become a popular alternative for land cover and land use classification. In this case, polygons can be selected as sampling units to match the conceptual model of the map. However, little attention has been paid to the use of polygons for the validation of those maps. In this paper, we quantitatively assess the prediction of the primary thematic accuracy indices when the sampling unit is a polygon. The variable size of the sample polygons is a major concern for the prediction of the accuracy indices. Indeed, the classification accuracy, in addition to being class-dependent, depends on the polygon area. A practical solution supported by a theoretical framework that is conditional to the sample dataset is proposed in this study. This new predictor takes advantage of the known classification results for an improved efficiency. Empirical results based on synthetic maps show that the new predictor outperforms alternative methods for overall accuracy. The RMSE of the area weighted predictor was achieved with 50% less sample polygons thanks to our new predictor. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A first step before assimilating Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L-band brightness temperatures (Tb) over land is to couple land surface models (LSMs) to microwave emission models. In this study, the Interactions between Soil Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) LSM is coupled to the Community Microwave Emission Modelling platform (CMEM). Simulations of Tb are performed over a 3-yr period (2003-2005) for a bare soil field in southwestern France, at the Surface Monitoring Of the Soil Reservoir EXperiment (SMOSREX) experimental site. Both ISBA and CMEM present several options for the representation of the soil moisture and soil temperature profiles. Simplified 2-layer simulations are compared with more detailed multilayer simulations. In the 2-layer simulations, the soil is divided into two layers (a thin surface layer and a bulk reservoir), and Fresnel laws are used in CMEM to model the smooth surface emissivity. In the multilayer simulations, the ISBA soil diffusion scheme is used (with 11 soil layers represented) together with either the Wilheit or Fresnel option of CMEM. The Tb simulations are compared to the Tb ground observations available for the SMOSREX site, at H and V polarizations and at different angles, and the impact of soil roughness is assessed. It is shown that taking surface soil moisture into account in the calculation of soil roughness improves the representation of the seasonal cycle and increases the correlation for all the versions of CMEM. The Tb derived from the most complex multilayer simulations correlate slightly better to the observations than the Tb derived from the 2-layer model (r = 0.84 and r = 0.82, respectively, for the pooled dataset). This is partly due to a better representation of the soil moisture profile. Finally, the multilayer model is used to investigate the L-band sampling depth for contrasting soil texture profiles. For a variety of soil textures, it is found that Tb are mainly driven by the top 15 cm soil layer. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Each year, spatial patterns of ocean color in the Baltic Sea differ in temporal evolution and magnitude. We have investigated the interannual variability of the spatially averaged vertical diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (K-d(490)) in response to atmospheric forcing and river discharge. Our results indicate that atmospheric forcing does not have a significant influence on interannual anomalies of K-d(490) in the Baltic Sea. This is dissimilar to the North Atlantic at the same latitudes, where interannual variability of phytoplankton blooms (ocean color chlorophyll concentration, Chl,and K-d) is to a large degree controlled by local weather. In contrast, in the Baltic Sea the interannual variability of K-d(490) is significantly influenced by river runoff. Higher values of K-d(490) are observed in years with larger inflow of water from rivers. Without access to more detailed information about the concentrations of various optically significant water components we can only speculate about the possible reasons for this relationship. Most likely a combination of several factors causes the observed positive correlation between K-d(490) and river discharge. These factors include development of more intense phytoplankton blooms in response to a larger supply of nutrients delivered by rivers. This conclusion is supported by satellite Chl data. However, an advection of optically important material with river water most likely also contributes to the bserved variability of K-d(490). The diffuse attenuation coefficient plays a critical role in many oceanographic processes. For example, K-d is essential for quantification of radiative heating of the ocean, in models of primary production and other photoprocesses, and in studies discussing water turbidity and water quality. Better understanding of the variability of K-d in the Baltic Sea can improve our knowledge of this marine environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Since the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) was launched in 1999 the sensor has acquired an extensive coverage of the Earth's surface. The ASTER archive has great potential for a variety of regional and continental scale studies. ASTER is particularly useful for geological applications and provides the potential to derive continental scale surface mineral abundance and composition maps providing a new and valuable information source for the resource exploration industry. An initiative to produce one such set of continental scale surface mineral abundance and composition maps for Australia from ASTER L1B VNIR, SWIR radiance at sensor data and ASTER L2 surface emissivity data was undertaken. The project successfully solved a number of technical challenges. This paper describes the processing and calibration methodology, which was developed to generate continental-scale mosaics of reflectance and emissivity from ASTER's nine reflected and five emitted bands.

AB Grassland ecosystems in the North America are primarily composed of C-3 and C-4 plant functional types (PFTs) that have different responses to the changing climate. Knowledge of their spatial distributions and temporal variations helps us better understand the ecological functions and climate dependencies of grasslands. This study used the 500-m MODIS surface reflectance products (MOD09A1) from 2000 to 2009 to extract NDVI time series of C-3 and C-4 grass PFTs in different floristic regions (tallgrass, shortgrass, and mixed-grass prairies.) A set of phenology metrics, including Start of Season, End of Season, Season Length, Peak NDVI, Peak Date, and END VI, were found useful in delineating these grass types. A phenology-assisted decision tree classifier was developed to map the four grass PFTs in the Great Plains. The relative abundance of C-3 and C-4 PFTs generally showed the expected latitudinal shifts. Longitudinal shifts of tallgrass and shortgrass PFTs were also in agreement with the distributions of floristic prairie regions. In shortgrass and northern mixed prairies, shortgrass C-3 was located in the north while shortgrass C-4 was in the south. The native tallgrass C-4 remained in prairie remnants, although other native grasslands had been mostly converted to croplands or tallgrass C-3-dominated pastures. The interannual spatial variations of PFTs were statistically correlated with climate factors over a 10-year study period. The preliminary findings revealed that the strength and direction of correlations varied geographically and seasonally for different PFTs. This spatio-temporally explicit information may provide quantitative inputs in ecological forecasting for various climate change scenarios. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Accurate remote retrieval of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations for inland and coastal turbid waters is a challenging task due to their optical complexity. An adaptive model was developed based on the merits of coupling a genetic algorithm to select spectral variables and partial least squares (GA-PLS) for regression. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to evaluate the GA-PLS model performance using datasets collected from 1140 stations encompassing a wide range of Chl-a and suspended sediment from nine water bodies across Central Indiana (CIN), USA, South Australia (SA), Taihu Lake (THL) in East China and Shitoukoumen Reservoir (STKR) in Northeast China with comparison to a widely accepted three-band model, and (2) to evaluate the GA-PLS spatial transferability with simulated ESA/Sentinel3/OLCI and Hyperion spectra. The GA-PLS and the three-band model yield accurate calibrations (Cal) for the SA dataset with R-2 above 0.98, and the corresponding validation (Val) shows relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) of less than 6.2% with narrow-band spectra. Both the GA-PLS and three-band model show stable performance for the CIN dataset (Cal: R-2 = 0.91 and 0.77; Val: rRMSE = 20.1% and 33.4%), THL dataset (Cal: R-2 = 0.91 and 0.88; Val: rRMSE = 30.1% and 33.7%), and STKR dataset (R-2 = 0.84 and 0.82; rRMSE = 29.1% and 33.2%). The results also reveal that simulated OLCI datasets degrade both the GA-PLS performance, and particularly the performance of the three-band model due to the coarser and discontinuous spectral configuration. Contrastingly, both the GA-PLS and the three-band model show improved results with the simulated Hyperion datasets. Our observation indicates that the GA-PLS model outperforms the three-band model in terms of spatial transferability; however, the three-band model has its own merits, considering its simplicity. Further analyses indicate that spectral measurement protocols, instrumentations, and inorganic suspended matter affect the GA-PLS and three-band model performances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Due to increasing global demand for natural rubber products, rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantation expansion has occurred in many regions where it was originally considered unsuitable. However, accurate maps of rubber plantations are not available, which substantially constrain our understanding of the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of rubber plantation expansion. In this study we developed a simple algorithm for accurate mapping of rubber plantations in northern tropical regions, by combining a forest map derived from microwave data and unique phenological characteristics of rubber trees observed from multi-temporal Landsat imagery. Phenology of rubber trees and natural evergreen forests in Hainan Island, China, was evaluated using eighteen Landsat TM/ETM+ images between 2007 and 2012. Temporal profiles of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance for rubber trees and natural forest were constructed. The results showed that rubber plantations are distinguishable from natural evergreen forests in two phenological phases: 1) during the defoliation (leaf-off) phase in late February-March, vegetation index (NDVI, EVI, LSWI) values were lower in rubber plantations than in natural evergreen forests; and 2) during the foliation (new leaf emergence) phase in late March-April, rubber plantations had similar NDVI and LSWI values but higher EVI and NIR reflectance values than in natural forests. Therefore, it is possible to delineate rubber plantations within forested landscapes using one to two optical images acquired in the defoliation and/or foliation period. The mapping technique was developed and applied in the Danzhou Region of Hainan. Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) 50-m Orthorectified Mosaic images were used to generate a forest cover map and further integrated with the phenological information of rubber plantations extracted from Landsat TM images during the foliation phase. The resultant map of rubber plantations has high accuracy (both producer's and user's accuracy is 96%). This simple and integrated algorithm has the potential to improve mapping of rubber plantations at the regional scale. This study also shows the value of time series Landsat images and emphasizes imagery selection at appropriate phenological phase for land cover classification, especially for delineating deciduous vegetation.

AB A map of land cover or land-cover change produced from remotely sensed data is linked to estimation of area of land cover or land-cover change via an accuracy assessment of the map. A variety of area estimators have been proposed based on different approaches to using the estimated error matrix produced from an accuracy assessment along with information available from the map. These estimators include a stratified estimator (where the strata are the map classes), several model-assisted estimators incorporating the map information as auxiliary variables in a variety of different models, and a bias-adjusted estimator that corrects for classification error when area is computed directly from the map. In some cases the same area estimator results from more than one approach. For stratified random sampling with the map classes defining the strata, the model-assisted and bias-adjusted estimators are equivalent to the stratified estimator of area that would typically be used with this sampling design. Thus the commonly used stratified estimator is the lone choice for stratified random sampling. For simple random sampling, the bias-adjusted estimator and a model-assisted difference estimator are equivalent, but other model-assisted options include poststratified (i.e., applying a stratified estimator to data obtained from a simple random sample), ratio, and simple regression estimators. A simulation study demonstrates that for simple random sampling, the poststratified estimator almost always has the smallest variance among these estimators. The only exception to the superior performance of the poststratified estimator occurred when overall accuracy was very high, the true proportion of area was small (i.e., less than 2%), and the accuracy assessment sample size was small (n = 100). Because the poststratified estimator for simple random sampling is equivalent to the stratified estimator used with stratified random sampling, the stratified estimator provides a unified, simple approach to area estimation for these two commonly used sampling designs.

AB A gridded population dataset was produced for Pakistan by developing an algorithm that distributed population either on the basis of per-pixel built-up area fraction or the per-pixel value of a weighted population likelihood layer. Per-pixel built-up area fraction was calculated using a classification and regression trees (CART) methodology integrating high- and medium-resolution satellite imagery. The likelihood layer was produced by weighting different geospatial layers according to their effect on the likelihood of population being found in the particular pixel. The geospatial layers integrated into the likelihood layer were: 1) proximity to remotely sensed built-up pixels, 2) density of settlement points in a fixed kernel, 3) slope, 4) elevation, and 5) heterogeneity of landcover types found within a search radius. The method for weighting these layers varied according to settlement patterns found in the provinces of Pakistan. Differences in zonal population estimates generated from the 100-meter gridded population layer resulting from this study, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's LandScan (2002), and CIESIN's Gridded Population of the World and Global Rural Urban Mapping Project (GPW and GRUMP) are examined. Population estimates for small areas produced using this paper's method were found to differ from census counts to a lesser degree than those produced using LandScan, GPW, or GRUMP. The root mean square error (RMSE) for small area population estimates for this method, LandScan, GPW, and GRUMP were 31,089, 48,001, 100,260, and 72,071, respectively. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Aircraft-mounted hyperspectral spectrometers were used to collect imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution for use in measuring optically active water quality characteristics of major rivers of Minnesota. Ground-based sampling undertaken concurrent with image acquisition provided calibration data for chlorophyll, suspended solids, turbidity and other measures of water clarity. Our approach identified the spectral characteristics that distinguish waters dominated by several inherent optical properties (IOPs), and we used those characteristics to develop models to map water quality characteristics in optically complex waters. For phytoplankton related variables (volatile suspended solids (VSS) and chlorophyll a (chl a)), the ratios of the scattering peak at the red edge (similar to 700 nm) with the reflectance troughs caused by chlorophyll absorption at similar to 670 nm and other plant pigment absorption peaks at 592 and 620 nm all were strong predictors of chl a and VSS (r(2) values of 0.73-0.94). The scattering peak at similar to 700 nm was a strong predictor of variables related to water clarity (total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and turbidity tube (T-tube)) (r(2) values of 0.77-0.93). For mineral-based variables (nonvolatile suspended solids (NVSS) and the ratio NVSS:TSS), combinations of the TSS and chl a relationships described above were strong predictors (r(2) values of 0.73-0.97) and the most robust because this model corrects for the scattering of phytoplankton at similar to 700 nm. Application of the methods to quantify spatial variations in water quality for stretches of the Mississippi River and its tributaries indicate that hyperspectral imagery can be used to distinguish and map key variables under complex IOP conditions, particularly to separate and map inorganic suspended sediments independently of chlorophyll levels.

AB Mangrove forests of the tropical and subtropical regions provide critical ecosystem services, fulfill important socio-economic and environmental functions, and support coastal livelihoods. These forests are also among the most vulnerable ecosystems, both to anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. Yet, no map or published study exists showing detailed spatiotemporal trends of mangrove deforestation at local to regional scales. This study uses change point and mixed-pixel analyses with a time series (2000-2010) of high-fidelity imagery from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for tracking deforestation of mangroves in the Mahakam Delta of Indonesia at 250 m spatial scale and a 3-monthly temporal interval. The results show that a total of 21,000 +/- 152 ha of mangrove land in the Mahakam Delta were deforested and converted to shrimp ponds in 11 years. In 2000, the deforested lands covered 47% of the entire delta, while in 2010 it increased to 75%. Deforestation rates varied in each year, but peaked in 2002 and declined since then. The combination of high-fidelity time series data and a robust method of change detection resulted in a virtual reconstruction of 11 years of drastic land change history of the delta's mangrove areas at a consistent spatiotemporal scale. We anticipate that the methodology developed in this study will be useful to reconstruct deforestation histories of other places as well. Also, our findings can potentially be used to further explore the socioeconomic drivers of mangrove deforestation so that reliable, appropriate and sustainable methods of local and regional scale adaptation/mitigation strategies can be developed.

AB Release of NLCD 2006 provides the first wall-to-wall land-cover change database for the conterminous United States from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Accuracy assessment of NLCD 2006 focused on four primary products: 2001 land cover, 2006 land cover, land-cover change between 2001 and 2006, and impervious surface change between 2001 and 2006. The accuracy assessment was conducted by selecting a stratified random sample of pixels with the reference classification interpreted from multi-temporal high resolution digital imagery. The NLCD Level II (16 classes) overall accuracies for the 2001 and 2006 land cover were 79% and 78%, respectively, with Level II user's accuracies exceeding 80% for water, high density urban, all upland forest classes, shrubland, and cropland for both dates. Level I (8 classes) accuracies were 85% for NLCD 2001 and 84% for NLCD 2006. The high overall and user's accuracies for the individual dates translated into high user's accuracies for the 2001-2006 change reporting themes water gain and loss, forest loss, urban gain, and the no-change reporting themes for water, urban, forest and agriculture. The main factor limiting higher accuracies for the change reporting themes appeared to be difficulty in distinguishing the context of grass. We discuss the need for more research on land-cover change accuracy assessment Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Since its launch, the Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) onboard Landsat-7 has been continuously monitored via different calibration techniques to ensure it maintains the science requirements for demanding application areas. The majority of its applications, including agriculture and forestry, require a robust calibration for medium to high reflective targets. However, when imaging water resources, then the question becomes whether the calibration coefficients are valid for the dark end of the sensor's responsivity curve. Motivated by the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) and its potential for providing long-term, robust water studies, in this effort, the calibration status of ETM+ visible bands are examined using a cross-calibration technique. The well-calibrated Terra-MODIS scenes (collection 5) of the past decade over relatively optically stable waters were chosen to evaluate ETM+ stability. The cross-comparison showed that the calibration instability of ETM+ reflective bands lie well within its radiometric uncertainty. The slight calibration differences were found to be less than 1.6%, 0.93%, and 3.2% for the blue, green and the red bands obtained for the period when the MODIS had been radiometrically stable. The NIR band of ETM+, however, exhibits, on average, 4.8% higher signals than those of MODIS. The error budget analysis for the calibration differences showed that 1.2%, 1.6%, 3.5%, and 6.5% errors are associated with the Visible-Near-Infrared (VNIR) bands, respectively. Using the results from the calibration study combined with simulations, it was demonstrated that ETM+ underestimates the retrieved diffuse surface reflectance (R-d) in the blue and the green bands as much as 12.2% and 4.4%, respectively, while the red band is overestimated 37%, on average, when studying slightly/moderately turbid. The uncertainties in the retrieval of R-d were applied in a water constituent retrieval framework where a physics-based model was utilized to obtain concentrations of chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS) from a Landsat-7 dataset in slightly/moderately turbid waters. It was found that the calibration-induced errors in the retrieval of R-d yield, on average, 20% error in retrieval of these components. The results indicate that although ETM+ is well calibrated, its calibration status should be quantified rigorously for water studies when physics-based methods are employed for the removal of atmospheric effects. The over-water characterization of Landsat satellites will become more crucial when the LDCM becomes operational due to its increased capabilities for water resource studies. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The LSA-SAF, MOD11A2.C5, and MOD11B1.C5 algorithms directly or indirectly utilize land cover classification and vegetation cover fraction data with the result that for arid regions their LSE are practically identical to the bare ground emissivities assigned to those classes. Over the gravel plains, mean LSA-SAF, ASTER-TES, and MODTES LSE are about 0.950 in the 11 mu m range, whereas mean MOD11A2.C5 and MOD11B1.C5 are about 1.5% (similar to 1 K) higher. The LSA-SAF algorithm misclassifies the sand dunes as 'open & closed shrubland', which results in an overestimated mean LSE (0.969). Since MOD11A2.C5 and MOD11B1.C5 utilize a similar classification and similar emissivity library data, their LSE estimates for the sand dunes are also too high (mean of 0.972 and 0.980, respectively). In contrast, the physics-based ASTER-TES and MODTES algorithms estimate mean sand dune LSE as 0.952 and 0.948, respectively. The physics-based MOD11B1.C4.1 algorithm produced noisy LSE estimates with frequent outliers at 5 km resolution: spatial averaging yielded mean LSE of 0.950 and 0.954 for the gravel plains and the sand dunes, respectively. Based on a combined analysis of in-situ LSE and TES retrieved LSE, and also accounting for uncertainty in the fraction of dry grass (only gravel plains), for future work it is recommended to use SEVIRI ch10.8 emissivities of 0.941 +/- 0.004 for the sand dunes and 0.944 +/- 0.015 for the gravel plains, respectively. The results suggest that split window algorithms would benefit significantly from using physically based MODTES LSE. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study follows up on the successful feasibility study of Neukermans et al. (2009) for mapping suspended matter in turbid waters from the SEVIRI sensor on board the METEOSAT geostationary weather satellite platform. Previous methodology is extended to the mapping of turbidity. T, and vertical attenuation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), K-PAR. The spatial resolution of the SEVIRI products is improved from 3 km x 6.5 km to 1 km x 2 km using the broad high resolution visual band. The previous atmospheric correction is further improved and the uncertainties on marine reflectance due to digitization are considered. Based on a two year archive of SEVIRI imagery, available every 15 min, the diurnal variability of T and K-PAR is investigated during cloud free periods and validated using half-hourly T and K-PAR data obtained from a system of moored buoys (SmartBuoys) in the southern North Sea. Based on numerous match-ups, 80% of SEVIRI derived T and K-PAR are within 53% and 39% of SmartBuoy T and K-PAR, respectively. Results further show that on cloud free days, the SEVIRI T and Km signals are in phase with the SmartBuoy data, with an average difference in the timing of the maximum T and K-PAR of 11 min and 23 min, respectively. It is concluded that diurnal variability of T and K-PAR can now be mapped by remote sensing offering new opportunities for improving ecosystem models and monitoring of turbidity. Limitations of the current SEVIRI sensor and perspectives for design of future geostationary sensors and synergy with polar orbiting satellites are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Post-fire effects assessments are crucial to evaluate the impact of fire on ecosystems. They are helpful in planning post-fire rehabilitation and useful for reducing uncertainties in current wildfire emission estimates. We have used MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator data over the 2011 Canyon fire in California, USA to evaluate the potential synergy between visible to short-wave infrared (VSWIR, 0.4-2.5 mu m) and mid to thermal infrared (MTIR, 3.5-12.5 mu m) data in a post-fire environment. We applied Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) inputting five endmembers: char, green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), substrate and shadow. Results revealed that fractional cover estimates of char, NPV and substrate are 5-7% better when VSWIR-MTIR data were combined, compared to using only VSWIR data. Combined VSWIR-MTIR imagery will become available at pixel sizes smaller than 100 m with future satellite sensors, such as the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI). The MESMA-derived char fractional cover was also shown to be strongly correlated with the Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI, R-adj(2) = 0.82) and the percentage of black trees and shrubs (R-adj(2) = 0.66) measured in the field. SMA-derived char fractions provide quantitative abundance maps which should prove valuable for improving wildfire emission estimates by refining burning efficiency values. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellite series is known to suffer from what is known as the orbital drift effect. The Long Term Data Record (LTDR [Pedelty et al., 2007]), which provides AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) data from these satellites for the 80s and the 90s, is also affected by this orbital drift. To correct this effect on Land Surface Temperature (LST) time series, a novel method is presented here, which consists in adjusting retrieved LST time series on the basis of statistical information extracted from the time series themselves. This method is as simple and straightforward as possible, in order to be implemented easily for such a large dataset as the LTDR. The correction is applied on a pixel by pixel basis, and relies on a 2nd order polynomial fit of per satellite solar zenithal angle (SZA) anomalies against time. If the pixel time series is identified as contaminated by the orbital drift for any of the different satellite active periods, LST anomalies are fitted linearly against both time and the 2nd order polynomial fit of SZA anomalies. This double fit allows for the removal of orbital drift influence without removing eventual trends in the signal, which is of utmost importance for vegetation change detection. When applied to simulated LST time series, this method shows errors comparable to the errors associated to LST estimation for most cases. When applied to LTDR LST time series, the approach normalizes the distribution of LST values at the beginning and end of each satellite activity period, and visual inspection of the time series does not show any residual orbital drift in the corrected EST time series. The approach also improves the significance of retrieved trends through the whole time span of the LTDR dataset. The application of this method to the whole LTDR dataset could lead to the compilation of the first coherent global dataset of land surface temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of this research was to develop a methodology for contributing in the automation of sugarcane mapping over large areas, with time-series of remotely sensed imagery. To this end, two major techniques were combined: Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and Data Mining (DM). OBIA was used to represent the knowledge needed to map sugarcane, whereas DM was applied to generate the knowledge model. To derive the image objects, the segmentation algorithm implemented in Definiens Developer (R) was used. The data mining algorithm used was J48, which generates decision trees (DT) from a previously prepared training set. The study area comprises three municipalities located in the northwest of Sao Paulo state, all of which are good representatives of the agricultural conditions in the Southern and Southeastern regions of Brazil. A time series of Landsat TM and ETM+ images was acquired in order to represent the wide range of pattern variation along the sugarcane crop cycle. After training, the DT was applied to the Landsat time series, thus generating the desired thematic map with sugarcane ready to harvest. Classification accuracy was calculated over a set of 500 points not previously used during the training stage. Using error matrix analysis and Kappa statistics, tests for statistical significance were derived. The statistics indicated that the classification achieved an overall accuracy of 94% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.87. Results show that the combination of OBIA and DM techniques is very efficient and promising for the sugarcane classification process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Forest cover and forest cover loss for the last decade, 2000-2010, have been quantified for the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) using Landsat time-series data set. This was made possible via an exhaustive mining of the Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) archive. A total of 8881 images were processed to create multi-temporal image metrics resulting in 99.6% of the DRC land area covered by cloud-free Landsat observations. To facilitate image compositing, a top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance calibration and image normalization using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) top of canopy (TOC) reflectance data sets were performed. Mapping and change detection was implemented using a classification tree algorithm. The national year 2000 forest cover was estimated to be 159,529.2 thousand hectares, with gross forest cover loss for the last decade totaling 2.3% of forest area. Forest cover loss area increased by 13.8% between the 2000-2005 and 2005-2010 intervals, with the greatest increase occurring within primary humid tropical forests. Forest loss intensity was distributed unevenly and associated with areas of high population density and mining activity. While forest cover loss is comparatively low in protected areas and priority conservation landscapes compared to forests outside of such areas, gross forest cover loss for all nature protection areas increased by 64% over the 2000 to 2005 and 2005 to 2010 intervals.

AB This study evaluates the use of waveform LIDAR data for the characterization of secondary forests stages in a Tropical Dry Forest (TDF) area of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. A secondary forest succession is defined here as regrowth of woody vegetation following a complete or heavy forest clearance for pasture, agriculture, or other human activity. We first compare the known spatial distribution of three main TDF successional stages (Early, Intermediate and Late successional stages) as constrained by published field observations of tree height with that obtained from a three-class classification of the LIDAR data. In doing so we explicitly assess the possibility of using LIDAR data to map the distribution of the three main TDFs stages. We demonstrates that changes in the forest vertical structure (such as height) associated with principal successional stages (Early, Intermediate and Late) of TDF secondary growth can be effectively identified from LIDAR data. The successional sequence observed is related to changes in the vertical distribution of woody components that occur when forest patches evolve from an Early Stage which is dominated by sparse trees and grass, to initial stages of intermediate secondary succession characterized by small canopies and a high density of understory regeneration, and then to more complex and developed stages of intermediate and late stage secondary succession which share some attributes of Old growth forests. We then focus on the Intermediate successional Stage since it is of highest interest to policy makers dealing with programs implementing payments for environmental services. We show that an analysis of the LIDAR data can identify successional three subclasses within the Intermediate Stage providing further insights in the development of secondary forest growth. A validation of the three new forest classes is provided using field observations showing a mean tree height and standard deviation of 6.16 +/- 0.87, 7.82 +/- 0.31 and 8.62 +/- 1.22. m.

AB Ground heat flux is an important component of the energy balance in bare soils or sparsely vegetated areas. This study presents the results of a validation experiment of a remote sensing method for ground heat flux. A heat diffusion model, calibrated to local soil heat flux soil temperature profile measurements at an eddy covariance flux station in Spain, was used to validate the remote sensing method. The high energy balance closure of 93% at the site, the high correspondence of modelled temperature profile data to observations, and agreement of retrieved thermal properties with literature data gave confidence in the validation target. The remote sensing method makes use of retrieved radiometric temperatures and night-time net radiation. It was applied to field radiometry measurements over bare soil and to MSG-SEVERI data (10% of the pixel of the field site was covered by vegetation). Despite its simplicity, the remote sensing model applied to the field radiometry performed well (slope of the regression against the validation target: 1.00, r(2) = 0.96). Good agreement was also found between the remote sensing method applied to field radiometry and to satellite data (slope of the regression: 0.79, r(2) = 0.89). (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The ability to use digital remotely sensed data for forest inventory is often limited by the nature of the measures, which, with the exception of multi-angular or stereo observations, are largely insensitive to vertically distributed attributes. As a result, empirical estimates are typically made to characterize attributes such as height, volume, or biomass, with known asymptotic relationships as signal saturation occurs. Lidar (light detection and ranging) has emerged as a robust means to collect and subsequently characterize vertically distributed attributes. Lidar has been established as an appropriate data source for forest inventory purposes; however, large area monitoring and mapping activities with lidar remain challenging due to the logistics, costs, and data volumes involved. The use of lidar as a sampling tool for large-area estimation may mitigate some or all of these problems. A number of factors drive, and are common to, the use of airborne profiling, airborne scanning, and spaceborne lidar systems as sampling tools for measuring and monitoring forest resources across areas that range in size from tens of thousands to millions of square kilometers. In this communication, we present the case for lidar sampling as a means to enable timely and robust large-area characterizations. We briefly outline the nature of different lidar systems and data, followed by the theoretical and statistical underpinnings for lidar sampling. Current applications are presented and the future potential of using lidar in an integrated sampling framework for large area ecosystem characterization and monitoring is presented. We also include recommendations regarding statistics, lidar sampling schemes, applications (including data integration and stratification), and subsequent information generation.

AB Binary snow maps and fractional snow cover data are provided routinely from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). This paper investigates how the wide observation angles of MODIS influence the current snow mapping algorithm in forested areas. Theoretical modeling results indicate that large view zenith angles (VZA) can lead to underestimation of fractional snow cover (FSC) by reducing the amount of the ground surface that is viewable through forest canopies, and by increasing uncertainties during the gridding of MODIS data. At the end of the MODIS scan line, the total modeled error can be as much as 50% for FSC. Empirical analysis of MODIS/Terra snow products in four forest sites shows high fluctuation in FSC estimates on consecutive days. In addition, the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) values, which are the primary input to the MODIS snow mapping algorithms, decrease as VZA increases at the site level. At the pixel level. NDSI values have higher variances, and are correlated with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in snow covered forests. These findings are consistent with our modeled results, and imply that consideration of view angle effects could improve MODIS snow monitoring in forested areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new algorithm for mapping burned areas in boreal forest using AVHRR archival data Long Term Data Record (LTDR) (0.05 degrees, ca. 5 km, version 3) was developed in Canada using burn records for the period between 1984 and 1999 and evaluated against AVHRR 1 km and AVHRR-PAL 8 km burned area map products. The algorithm combined 1) absolute and relative radiometric thresholds, 2) a Bayesian network classifier, and 3) neighborhood analysis for spatial fire coherence. Fire event records from Canadian Forest Service National Fire Database (CFSNFD) for western Canada were used to train the algorithm. LTDR and AVHRR 1 km burned area mapping were similar for the same area, and correlated well to CFSNFD annual fire event records for western Canada, r(2) = 0.72 and 0.77, respectively. In addition, the LTDR mapping correlated well with fires for all of Canada in the CFSNFD database (r(2) = 0.65). This mapping product was a significant improvement over an 8 km AVHRR-PAL burned area map product. For mapping boreal forests burned areas globally, this study demonstrates the potential accuracy for where LTDR represents the highest spatial and temporal resolution of daily images available since the 1980s.

AB We use a satellite-based survey of glacier surface elevation changes, speeds and surface melt conditions between 2000 and 2011 to quantify mass loss from the Northern Patagonian Icefield (NPI), Chile. A history of ice elevation change is found by differencing ASTER Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) relative to a void-filled version of the DEM collected by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) in February 2000. Thinning rates have accelerated at lower elevations, while above the Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA) recent thinning rates are not significantly different from those observed in previous studies. A volumetric change of -4.06 +/- 0.11 km(3)/yr is found by summing surface elevation changes over all glaciers in the NPI. This is regarded as a lower bound because volume loss due to frontal retreat and sub-aqueous melting is not included. This volume change is converted to a mass loss of 3.40 +/- 0.07 Gt/yr, taking into account density differences above and below the equilibrium line. We find that the NPI is providing at least 0.009 +/- 0.0002 mm/yr to ongoing sea level change, in agreement with previous estimates.
   Sub-pixel offset tracking of ASTER image pairs is used to produce glacier displacements over intervals typically ranging from 6 days to 18 months. The first whole icefield composite velocity map is presented. The terminus of the San Rafael Glacier, on the western side of the NPI sustained a peak calving front speed of 19.7 +/- 1.2 m/day for 7 days in the austral fall of 2007. Passive microwave observations indicate that the surface of the accumulation basin of the glacier was wet during this period of rapid motion, suggesting that the fast speed may be a consequence of a rise in sub-glacial water pressure, sourced from melt or rainwater making its way to the glacier bed and reducing basal friction. Several other outlet glaciers, including the Benito and HPN1 glaciers, on the isolated western side of the icefield accelerated while thinning between 2007 and 2011. Marked acceleration also occurred after 2007 at the front of the San Quintin Glacier, the largest outlet glacier of the NPI.
   The paucity of thickness measurements at the outlet glaciers means it is impossible to accurately gauge the mass flux of the icefield and thus give a full estimate of the mass balance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB There are many sea surface temperature (SST) datasets derived from various satellite instruments with different characteristics in terms of orbit, coverage, retrieval, calibration, accuracy and measurement type. This paper presents the results of a project to combine SSTs from two instruments: the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) SSTs and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Pathfinder SSTs. The dual-view nature of the (A)ATSR series of radiometers enables high-quality sea surface temperatures to be retrieved. These SSTs are ideal for using as a reference in order to bias-adjust the AVHRR series of instruments. In addition a method to correct for aerosol effects in the AVHRR SSTs is employed using aerosol optical depth from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer. The method enables positive characteristics of both datasets to be combined to provide a dataset of potentially high-quality, long time-series, large data coverage satellite sea surface temperatures for climate monitoring purposes.
   An AVHRR SST dataset at 1/4 degree spatial resolution with associated systematic biases and uncertainties is produced for climate research covering the period 1985 to 1998. The method is used to produce improved AVHRR SSTs for the period 1991 to the present (when the ATSRs are available) and additionally the method can be used to estimate biases on AVHRR SSTs prior to the first ATSR launch (1985 to 1991).
   The bias-correction has the effect of reducing an observed cool bias in the AVHRR SSTs, relative to the Hadley Centre Sea-Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadISST), especially in cases of high volcanic and Saharan dust aerosol. The time-series indicates that the bias correction scheme is effective during the 1990s at decreasing the cool bias in the AVHRR SSTs. The scheme is especially effective in times of high atmospheric volcanic aerosol levels such as the period following the Mount Pinatubo eruption in 1991.

AB Spatial averaging schemes have often been used to improve empirical models that relate radar backscatter coefficient to soil moisture. However, reducing the noise in backscatter response not related to soil moisture often results in signal losses that are related to soil moisture. In this study we tested whether a spatial averaging scheme based on topographic features improved regressions relating backscatter coefficient and soil moisture on the low relief landscape of the Prairie Pothole Region of Canada. Soil moisture data were collected along hillslope transects within pothole drainage basins at intervals coincident with RADARSAT-1 satellite overpass. Spatial averaging schemes were designed at four scales: pixel, topographic feature (uplands, side-slopes, and lowlands), pothole drainage basin, and landscape (0.8 km x 1.6 km). The relationship between soil moisture and backscatter coefficient improved with increasing area of spatial averaging from a pixel (R-2=0.18, P<0.005), to the pothole drainage basin (R-2=0.36, P<0.005), to the landscape (R-2=0.66, P<0.005). However, the strongest relationship (R-2=0.72, P<0.005) was obtained by spatially averaging radar images based on topographic features. These findings indicate that topographically based spatial averaging of RADARSAT-1 imagery improves empirical models that are created to map the complex patterns of soil moisture in prairie pothole landscapes.

AB Vegetation structure retrieval accuracies from spaceborne Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data are affected by surface topography, background noise and sensor saturation. This study uses a physical approach to remove surface topography effect from lidar returns to retrieve vegetation height from ICESat/GLAS data over slope terrains.
   Slope-corrected vegetation heights from ICESat/GLAS data were compared to airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) (20 m footprint size) and small-footprint lidar data collected in White Mountain National Forest, NH. Impact of slope on LVIS vegetation height estimates was assessed by comparing LVIS height before and after slope correction with small-footprint discrete-return lidar and field data. Slope-corrected GLAS vegetation heights match well with 98 percentile heights from small-footprint lidar (R-2=0.77, RMSE=2.2 m) and top three LVIS mean (slope-corrected) heights (R-2=0.64, RMSE=3.7 m). Impact of slope on LVIS heights is small, however, comparison of LVIS heights (without slope correction) with either small footprint lidar or field data indicates that our scheme improves the overall LVIS height accuracy by 0.4-0.7 m in this region. Vegetation height can be overestimated by 3m over a 15 degrees slope without slope correction. More importantly, both slope-corrected GLAS and LVIS height differences are independent of slope. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the physical approach to remove surface topography from large footprint lidar data to improve accuracy of maximum vegetation height estimates.
   GLAS waveforms were compared to aggregated LVIS waveforms in Bartlett Experimental Forest, NH, to evaluate the impact of background noise and sensor saturation on vegetation structure retrievals from ICESat/GLAS. We found that GLAS waveforms with sensor saturation and low background noise match well with aggregated LVIS waveforms, indicating these waveforms capture vertical vegetation structure well. However, waveforms with large noise often lead to mismatched waveforms with LVIS and underestimation of waveform extent and vegetation height. These results demonstrate the quality of ICESat/GLAS vegetation structure estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Since the launch of sensors with angular observation capabilities, such as CHRIS and MISR, the additional potential of multi-angular observations for vegetation structural and biochemical variables has been widely recognised. Various methods have been successfully implemented to estimate forest biochemical and biophysical variables from atmospherically-corrected multi-angular data, but the use of physically based radiative transfer (RT) models is still limited. Because both canopy and atmosphere have an anisotropic behaviour, it is important to understand the multi-angular signal measured by the sensor at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). Coupled canopy-atmosphere RT models allow linking surface variables directly to the TOA radiance measured by the sensor and are therefore very interesting tools to use for estimating forest variables from multi-angular data.
   We investigated the potential of TOA multi-angular radiance data for estimating forest variables by inverting a coupled canopy-atmosphere physical RT model. The case study focussed on three Norway spruce stands located at the Bily Kriz experimental site (Czech Republic), for which multi-angular CHRIS and field data were acquired in September 2006. The soil-leaf-canopy RI model SLC and the atmospheric model MODTRAN4 were coupled using a method allowing to make full use of the four canopy angular reflectance components provided by SLC. The TOA radiance simulations were in good agreement with the spectral and angular signatures measured by CHRIS. Singular value decompositions of the Jacobian matrices showed that the dimensionality of the variable estimation problem increased from 3 to 6 when increasing the number of observation angles from 1 to 4. The model inversion was conducted for two cases: 4 and 7 variables. The most influential parameters were chosen as free variables in the look-up tables, namely: vertical crown cover (Cv), fraction of bark material (fl3), needle chlorophyll content (needleCab), needle dry matter content (needleCdm) for the 4-variable case, and additionally, tree shape factor (Zeta), dissociation factor (D), and needle brown pigments content (needleCs) in the 7-variable case. All angular combinations were tested, and the best estimates were obtained with combinations using two or three angles, depending on the number of variables and on the stand used. Overall, this case study showed that, although making use of its full potential is still a challenge, TOA multi-angular radiance data do have a higher potential for variable estimation than mono-angular data.

AB The AERONET-based Surface Reflectance Validation Network (ASRVN) is an operational processing system developed for validation of satellite derived surface reflectance products at regional and global scales. The ASRVN receives 50 x 50 km(2) subsets of MODIS data centered at AERONET sites along with AERONET aerosol and water vapor data, and performs an atmospheric correction. The ASRVN produces surface bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF), albedo, parameters of the Ross-Thick Li-Sparse (RTLS) BRF model, as well as Hemispherical-Directional Reflectance Factor (HDRF), which is required for comparison with the ground-based measurements. This paper presents a comparison of ASRVN HDRF with the ground-based HDRF measurements collected during 2001-2008 over a bright calibration Railroad Valley, Nevada site as part of the MODIS land validation program. The ground measurements were conducted by the Remote Sensing Group (RSG) at the University of Arizona using an ASD spectrometer. The study reveals a good agreement between ASRVN and RSG HDRF for both MODIS Terra and Aqua with rmse -0.01-0.025 in the 500 m MODIS land bands B1-B7. Obtained rinse is below uncertainties due to the spatial and seasonal variability of the bright calibration 1 km(2) area. While two MODIS instruments have a similar rmse in the visible bands, MODIS Aqua has a better agreement (lower arise) with the ground data than MODIS Terra at wavelengths 0.87-2.1 mu m. An independent overall good agreement of two MODIS instruments with the ground data indicates that the relative calibration of MODIS Terra and Aqua at medium-to-bright reflectance levels for the stated time period is significantly better than uncertainties of the ASRVN and ground data.

AB We present a new methodology to generate 30-m resolution land surface albedo using Landsat surface reflectance and anisotropy information from concurrent MODIS 500-m observations. Albedo information at fine spatial resolution is particularly useful for quantifying climate impacts associated with land use change and ecosystem disturbance. The derived white-sky and black-sky spectral albedos may be used to estimate actual spectral albedos by taking into account the proportion of direct and diffuse solar radiation arriving at the ground. A further spectral-to-broadband conversion based on extensive radiative transfer simulations is applied to produce the broadband albedos at visible, near infrared, and shortwave regimes. The accuracy of this approach has been evaluated using 270 Landsat scenes covering six field stations supported by the SURFace RADiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) and Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains (ARM/SGP) network Comparison with field measurements shows that Landsat 30-m snow-free shortwave albedos from all seasons generally achieve an absolute accuracy of +/- 0.02-0.05 for these validation sites during available clear days in 2003-2005, with a root mean square error less than 0.03 and a bias less than 0.02. This level of accuracy has been regarded as sufficient for driving global and regional climate models. The Landsat-based retrievals have also been compared to the operational 16-day MODIS albedo produced every 8-days from MODIS on Terra and Aqua (MCD43A). The Landsat albedo provides more detailed landscape texture, and achieves better agreement (correlation and dynamic range) with in-situ data at the validation stations, particularly when the stations include a heterogeneous mix of surface covers.

AB The Neyriz ophiolite occurs along the Zagros suture zone in SW Iran, and is part of a 3000-km obduction belt thrusting over the edge of the Arabian continent during the late Cretaceous. This complex typically consists of altered dunites and peridotites, layered and massive gabbros, sheeted dykes and pillow lavas, and a thick sequence of radiolarites. Reflectance and emittance spectra of Neyriz ophiolite rock samples were measured in the laboratory and their spectra were used as endmembers in a spectral feature fitting (SF) algorithm. Laboratory spectral reflectance measurements of field samples showed that in the visible through shortwave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) wavelength region the ultramafic and gabbroic rocks are characterized by ferrous-iron and Fe, Mg-OH spectral features, and the pillow lavas and radiolarites are characterized by spectral features of ferric-iron and Al-OH. The laboratory spectral emittance spectra also revealed a wide wavelength range of Si-O spectral features for the ophiolite rock units. After continuum removal of the spectra, the SF classification method was applied to the VNIR + SWIR 9-band stack, and to the 11-band data set of SWIR and TIR data sets of the Advanced Spacebome Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor, using field spectra as training sets for evaluating the potential of these data sets in discriminating ophiolite rock units. Output results were compared with the geological map of the area and field observations, and were assessed by the use of confusion matrices. The assessment showed, in terms of kappa coefficient, that the SFF classification method with continuum removal applied to the SWIR data achieved excellent results, which were distinctively better than those obtained using VNIR + SWIR data and TIR data alone.

AB ERS-1/2 tandem coherence was reported to have high potential for the mapping of boreal forest stem volume (e.g. Santoro et al., 2002, 2007a; Wagner et al., 2003; Askne & Santoro, 2005). Large-scale application of the data for forest stem volume mapping, however, is hindered by the variability of coherence with meteorological and environmental acquisition conditions. The traditional way of stem volume retrieval is based on the training of models, relating coherence to stem volume, with the aid of forest inventory data which is generally available for a few small test sites but not for large areas. In this paper a new approach is presented that allows model training using the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields canopy cover product (Hansen et al., 2003) without further need for ground data. A comparison of the new approach with the traditional regression-based and ground-data dependent model training is presented in this paper for a multiseasonal ERS-1/2 tandem dataset covering several well known Central Siberian forest sites. As a test scenario for large-area application, the approach was applied to a multi-seasonal ERS-1/2 tandem dataset of 223 ERS-1 and ERS-2 image pairs covering Northeast China (similar to 1.5 million km(2)) to map four stem volume classes (0-20, 20-50, 50-80, and >80 m(3)/ha).

AB The goal of this study is to propose a new classification of African ecosystems based on an 8-year analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets from SPOT/VEGETATION. We develop two methods of classification. The first method is obtained from a k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) classifier, which represents a simple machine learning algorithm in pattern recognition. The second method is hybrid in that it combines k-NN clustering, hierarchical principles and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The nomenclature of the two classifications relies on three levels of vegetation structural categories based on the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS). The two main outcomes are: (i) The delineation of the spatial distribution of ecosystems into five bioclimatic ecoregions at the African continental scale; (ii) Two ecosystem maps were made sequentially: an initial map with 92 ecosystems from the k-NN, plus a deduced hybrid classification with 73 classes, which better reflects the bio-geographical patterns. The inclusion of bioclimatic information and successive k-NN clustering elements helps to enhance the discrimination of ecosystems. Adopting this hybrid approach makes the ecosystem identification and labelling more flexible and more accurate in comparison to straightforward methods of classification. The validation of the hybrid classification, conducted by crossing-comparisons with validated continental maps, displayed a mapping accuracy of 54% to 61%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Quantifying and monitoring the structure and degradation of tropical forests over regional to global scales is gaining increasing scientific and societal importance. Reliable automated methods are only beginning to appear; for instance, through the recent development of textural approaches applied to high resolution optical imagery. In particular, the Fourier Transform Textural Ordination (FOTO) method shows some potential to provide non-saturating estimates of tropical forest structure, including for large scale applications. However, we need to understand more precisely how canopy structure interacts with physical signals (light) to produce a given texture, notably to assess the method's sensitivity to varying sun-view acquisition conditions. In this study, we take advantage of the detailed description of canopy topography provided by airborne small footprint LiDAR data acquired over the Paracou forest experimental station in French Guiana. Using hillshade models and a range of sun-view angles identical to the actual parameter distributions found for Quickbird (TM) images over the Amazon, we study noise and bias in texture estimation induced by the changing configurations. We introduce the bidirectional texture function, which summarizes these effects, and in particular the existence of a textural 'hot spot', similar to a well-known feature of bidirectional reflectance studies. For texture, this effect implies that coarseness decreases in configurations for which shadows are concealed to the observer. We also propose a method, termed partitioned standardization, that allows mitigating acquisition effects and discuss the potential for an operational use of VHR optical imagery and the FOTO method in the current context of international decisions to reduce CO2 emissions due to deforestation and forest degradation.

AB Accurate and precise detection of phenology events is needed to assess trends in seasonal vegetation development indicative of climate or other environmental change processes. In this research, detection accuracy of start of season (SOS) phenology for deciduous forest across Eastern Canada was assessed using satellite time series and in situ PlantWatch observations. Several aspects were evaluated regarding performance of phenology information extraction: 1) effect of compositing period, 2) individual performance of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensors, and 3) performance for these sensors combined. The AVHRR and MERIS sensors were used as they are overlapping operational missions with planned future continuity. Three approaches to utilizing the multi-sensor data were tested: 1) inter-calibrating NDVI data between sensors and using the multi-sensor data stream to detect SOS, 2) combining independently derived SOS estimates from AVHRR and MERIS based on a weighted average, and 3) combining approaches 1 and 2. Comparison with in situ observations of leaf out and first bloom showed that combining independent SOS estimates from AVHRR and MERIS was better than using the inter-calibrated multi-sensor data. Combining SOS estimates from both sensors reduced error by 1-2 days compared to the individual sensor results. Composite periods from 7 to 11 days produced the best results for leaf out with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5 days. Results for first bloom were not as good as those for leaf out, producing a MAE of 6.5 days. For first bloom, compositing periods greater than 11 days did not increase error at the same rate as seen for leaf out. However, the larger MAE observed for first bloom may have masked this effect.

AB Incorporating cover crops into agricultural systems can improve soil structural properties, increase nutrient availability, reduce erosion and loss of agrochemicals, and suppress weeds. These benefits are a function of the amount of cover crop biomass that enters the soil. The ability to easily and inexpensively quantify the spatial variability of cover crop biomass is needed to better understand and predict its potential as an input to agricultural systems. Here, we explore the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a source of information for improving accuracy and precision of cover crop biomass prediction. We focus on developing models that account for biomass variability within and among fields. These models are used to produce digital data layers of predicted biomass and associated uncertainty. We propose hierarchical nonlinear models with field random effects and a residual variance function to accommodate strong heteroscedasticity. These models are motivated using aboveground biomass of red clover (Trifolium pratense L) measured on three different dates in five fields in southwest Michigan. Model adequacy was assessed using the Deviance Information Criterion. Given this criterion, the "best" fitting model included field effects and a polynomial function to account for non-constant residual variance. Importantly, we demonstrate that accounting for heteroscedasticity in the model fitting is critical for capturing uncertainty in subsequent biomass prediction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB We develop and evaluate water clear of sea ice (open water following ice cover) detection algorithms that make use of Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) SeaWinds/QuikSCAT (QuikSCAT) backscatter (sigma degrees) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) brightness temperature (T-B) measurements. Algorithm validation was performed within Canadian Arctic waters using the Canadian Ice Service Digital Archive (CISDA) ice charts, NASATeam ice concentration estimates, extended AVHRR Polar Pathfinder (APP-x) albedo data, RADARSAT-1 imagery, and MODIS imagery. Results indicate that the temporal evolution of QuikSCAT sigma degrees, AMSR-E polarization ratio (PR18), and AMSR-E vertical spectral gradient ratio (GR3618) can detect water clear of sea ice events, however mean differences due to frequency dependent characteristics of the data (spatial resolution; sensitivity to open water) were apparent. All water clear of sea ice algorithms are in good agreement with the timing and clearing patterns given by the CISDA. The QuikSCAT algorithm provided a more representative ice edge and more details on the ice clearing process due to higher spatial resolution, however, transient clearing events were better represented by the AMSR-E PR(18) or (GR3618) algorithm. By exploiting the strengths of each sensor, we found that a QuikSCAT and AMSR-E fused algorithm provide improved open water area estimates by as much as 11%. The fusion of QuikSCAT and AMSR-E PR(18) yielded in the most spatially representative open water detection. The residual surface of the water clear of sea ice algorithms was found to provide another measure of the average September minimum pan-Arctic sea ice extent within 6% of the NASATeam algorithm estimates.

AB Time series of satellite sensor-derived data can be used in the light use efficiency (LUE) model for gross primary productivity (GPP). The LUE model and a closely related linear regression model were studied at an ombrotrophic peatland in southern Sweden. Eddy covariance and chamber GPP, incoming and reflected photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), field-measured spectral reflectance, and data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used in this study. The chamber and spectral reflectance measurements were made on four experimental treatments: unfertilized control (Ctrl). nitrogen fertilized (N), phosphorus fertilized (P), and nitrogen plus phosphorus fertilized (NP). For Ctrl, a strong linear relationship was found between GPP and the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (APAR) (R-2=0.90). The slope coefficient (epsilon(s), where s stands for "slope") for the linear relationship between seasonal time series of GPP and the product of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and PPFD was used as a proxy for the light use efficiency factor (epsilon). There were differences in epsilon(s) depending on the treatments with a significant effect for N compared to Ctrl (ANOVA: p = 0.042, Tukey's: p <= 0.05). Also. epsilon(s) was linearly related to the cover degree of vascular plants (R-2= 0.66). As a sensitivity test, the regression coefficients (epsilon(s) and intercept) for each treatment were used to model time series of 16-day GPP from the product of MODIS NDVI and PPFD. Seasonal averages of GPP were calculated for 2005, 2006. and 2007, which resulted in up to 19% higher average GPP for the fertilization treatments compared to Ctrl. The main conclusion is that the LUE model and the regression model can be applied in peatlands but also that temporal and spatial changes in epsilon or the regression coefficients should be considered.

AB Satellite image-based maps of forest attributes are of considerable interest and are used for multiple purposes such as international reporting by countries that have no national forest inventory and small area estimation for all countries. Construction of the maps typically entails, in part, rectifying the satellite images to a geographic coordinate system, observing ground plots whose coordinates are obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers that are calibrated to the same geographic coordinate system, and then matching ground plots to image pixels containing the centers of the ground plots. Errors in rectification and GPS coordinates cause observations of ground attributes to be associated with spectral values of incorrect pixels which, in turn, introduces classification errors into the resulting maps. The most important finding of the study is that for common magnitudes of rectification and GPS errors, as many as half the ground plots may be assigned to incorrect pixels. The effects on areal estimates obtained by aggregating class predictions for individual pixels are deviation of the estimates from their true values, erroneous confidence intervals, and incorrect inferences. Results are reported in detail for both probability-based (design-based) and model-based approaches to inference for proportion forest area using maps constructed from Landsat imagery, forest inventory plot observations and a logistic regression model.

AB Differencing of digital satellite image pairs highlights subtle changes in near-identical scenes of Earth surfaces. Using the mathematical relationships relevant to photoclinometry, we examine the effectiveness of this method for the study of localized ice sheet surface topography changes using numerical experiments. We then test these results by differencing images of several regions in West Antarctica, including some where changes have previously been identified in altimeter profiles. The technique works well with coregistered images having low noise, high radiometric sensitivity, and near-identical solar illumination geometry. Clouds and frosts detract from resolving surface features. The ETM+ sensor on Landsat-7, ALI sensor on EO-1, and MODIS sensor on the Aqua and Terra satellite platforms all have potential for detecting localized topographic changes such as shifting dunes, surface inflation and deflation features associated with sub-glacial lake fill-drain events, or grounding line changes. Availability and frequency of MODIS images favor this sensor for wide application, and using it, we demonstrate both qualitative identification of changes in topography and quantitative mapping of slope and elevation changes.

AB This study investigates the effects of soil moisture (SM) on thermal infrared (TIR) land surface emissivity (LSE) using field- and satellite-measurements. Laboratory measurements were used to simulate the effects of rainfall and subsequent surface evaporation on the LSE for two different sand types. The results showed that the LSE returned to the dry equilibrium state within an hour after initial wetting, and during the drying process the SM changes were uncorrelated with changes in LSE. Satellite retrievals of LSE from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were examined for an anomalous rainfall event over the Namib Desert in Namibia during April, 2006. The results showed that increases in Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) derived soil moisture and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall estimates corresponded closely with LSE increases of between 0.08-0.3 at 8.6 mu m and up to 0.03 at 11 mu m for MODIS v4 and AIRS products. This dependence was lost in the more recent MODIS v5 product which artificially removed the correlation due to a stronger coupling with the split-window algorithm, and is lost in any algorithms that force the LSE to a predetermined constant as in split-window type algorithms like those planned for use with the NPOESS Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Good agreement was found between MODIS land surface temperatures (LSTs) derived from the Temperature Emissivity Separation (TES) and day/night v4 algorithm (MOD11B1 v4), while the split-window dependent products (MOD11B1 v5 and MOD11A1) had cooler mean temperatures on the order of 1-2 K over the Namib Desert for the month of April 2006.

AB Forest structural diversity can serve as an important indicator of biodiversity. The relationship between spaceborne hyperspectral remotely sensed data and several measures of forest structure was explored over a 625 km(2) coastal temperate forest landscape on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Thirteen Hyperion bands were selected for analysis based on the documented and hypothesized importance of various spectral wavelengths to forest characterization. To aid in understanding spectral trends, measures of forest stand structural diversity (projected age, projected height, and stand species composition complexity) were derived from forest inventory data. The spectral distance between the stand mean and standard deviation of reflectance and related expectations from global equivalents for each of the 13 bands were used to relate measures of spectral diversity (N = 801 forest inventory stands).
   Canonical correlation analysis was then used to determine the independent and shared relationships between these selected measures of forest structural diversity (dependent variables) and spectral diversity (independent variables). The dependent variables that were most strongly correlated with the first canonical variate were projected age and projected height, with canonical loadings of 0.973 and 0.979, respectively. In contrast, stand species composition complexity had a weak, negative correlation with spectral diversity (canonical loading = -0.025). The wavelengths contributing the most to the canonical function included: 681-740 nm, 551-680 nm, and 1401-2400 nm. There have been few studies that attempt to directly link spectral and species diversity in temperate forest environments. From this initial investigation, we posit that the complex spectral response of coastal temperate forests may confound efforts to directly link spectral and species diversity across a range of site conditions. Our results, which are constrained by the spectral and spatial resolution of the data used, our target environment, and the metrics selected for measuring forest structure, suggest that attributes that characterize forest structural conditions may have a more meaningful relationship with spectral diversity than measures of species diversity alone, and that future studies in coastal temperate forests that seek to link spectral diversity with biodiversity should include measures of forest structural diversity, in addition to measures of species diversity.

AB During the last three decades, the large spatial coverage of remote sensing data has been used in coral reef research to map dominant substrate types, geomorphologic zones, and bathymetry. During the same period, field studies have documented statistical relationships between variables quantifying aspects of the reef habitat and its fish community. Although the results of these studies are ambiguous, some habitat variables have frequently been found to correlate with one or more aspects of the fish community. Several of these habitat variables, including depth, the structural complexity of the substrate, and live coral cover, are possible to estimate with remote sensing data. In this study, we combine a set of statistical and machine-learning models with habitat variables derived from IKONOS data to produce spatially explicit predictions of the species richness, biomass, and diversity of the fish community around two reefs in Zanzibar. In the process, we assess the ability of IKONOS imagery to estimate live coral cover, structural complexity and habitat diversity, and we explore the importance of habitat variables, at a range of spatial scales, in the predictive models using a permutation-based technique. Our findings indicate that structural complexity at a fine spatial scale (similar to 5 to 10 m) is the most important habitat variable in predictive models of fish species richness and diversity, whereas other variables such as depth, habitat diversity, and structural complexity at coarser spatial scales contribute to predictions of biomass. In addition, our results demonstrate that complex model types such as tree-based ensemble techniques provide superior predictive performance compared to the more frequently used linear models, achieving a reduction of the cross-validated root-mean-squared prediction error of 3-11%. Although aerial photographs and airborne lidar instruments have recently been used to produce spatially explicit predictions of reef fish community variables, our study illustrates the possibility of doing so with satellite data. The ability to use satellite data may bring the cost of creating such maps within the reach of both spatial ecology researchers and the wide range of organizations involved in marine spatial planning.

AB The land-cover thematic accuracy of NLCD 2001 was assessed from a probability-sample of 15,000 pixels. Nationwide, NLCD 2001 overall Anderson Level II and Level I accuracies were 78.7% and 85.3%, respectively. By comparison, overall accuracies at Level II and Level I for the NLCD 1992 were 58% and 80%. Forest and cropland were two classes showing substantial improvements in accuracy in NLCD 2001 relative to NLCD 1992. NLCD 2001 forest and cropland user's accuracies were 87% and 82%, respectively, compared to 80% and 43% for NLCD 1992. Accuracy results are reported for 10 geographic regions of the United States, with regional overall accuracies ranging from 68% to 86% for Level II and from 79% to 91% at Level I. Geographic variation in class-specific accuracy was strongly associated with the phenomenon that regionally more abundant land-cover classes had higher accuracy. Accuracy estimates based on several definitions of agreement are reported to provide an indication of the potential impact of reference data error on accuracy. Drawing on our experience from two NLCD national accuracy assessments, we discuss the use of designs incorporating auxiliary data to more seamlessly quantify reference data quality as a means to further advance thematic map accuracy assessment.

AB Polar ice masses and sheets are sensitive indicators of climate change. Small-scale surface roughness significantly impacts the microwave emission of the sea ice/snow surface; however, published results of surface roughness measurements of sea ice are rare. Knowing the refractive index is important to discriminate between objects. In this study, the small-scale roughness and refractive index over sea ice are estimated with AMSR-E observations and a unique method. Consequently, the small-scale surface roughness of 0.25 cm to 0.5 cm at AMSR-E 6.9 GHz shows reasonable agreement with the results of known observations, ranging from 0.2 cm to 0.6 cm for the sea ice in the Antarctic and Arctic regions. The refractive indexes are retrieved from 1.6 to 1.8 for winter, from 1.2 to 1.4 for summer in the Arctic and the Antarctic, which are similar to those of the sea ice and results from previous studies. This research shows the physical characteristics of the sea ice edges and melting process. Accordingly, this investigation provides an effective procedure for retrieving the small-scale roughness and refractive index of sea ice and snow. Another advantage of this study is the ability to distinguish sea ice from the sea surface by their relative small-scale roughness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB At this point, models, and accompanying field data, that could be used to predict the likely response of estuaries and tidal marshes to future environmental change are lacking. To improve this situation, monitoring efforts in these complex ecosystems need to be intensified, and new, efficient monitoring techniques should be developed. In this context, our research assessed the use of IKONOS satellite imagery to map plant communities at Tivoli Bays, in the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve (HRNERR). Tivoli Bays, a freshwater tidal wetland, contains a unique assemblage of plant communities, including three invasive plants (Trapa natans, Phragmites australis, and Lythrum salicaria). To study the effects of textural information on the accuracy of land cover maps produced for the HRNERR, seven different 11-class land cover maps were produced using a maximum-likelihood classification on seven combinations of spectral and textural data derived from an IKONOS image. Conventional contingency tables served as a basis for an accuracy assessment of these maps. The overall classification accuracies, as assessed by the contingency tables, ranged from 45% to 77.7%. The maximum-likelihood classification relying on four spectral and four 5-by-5 filter textural bands (created by superposing a textural filter separately on each band of the IKONOS image) had the lowest overall accuracy, whereas the one based on four spectral and four 3-by-3 filter textural bands associated with all segments, identified by an object-based classification of the IKONOS image, had the highest accuracy. Results suggest that a combination of per-pixel classification and incorporation of texture for segments generated through an object-based classification slightly increases classification accuracy from 76.2% for the maximum-likelihood classification of the four spectral bands of the IKONOS image to 77.7% for the combination of spectral and textural information produced for selected segments. Further analysis indicates that better results may be obtained by using other types of data within the segments and that the traditional approach to the selection of training and accuracy sites may negatively bias the results for a combination per-pixel and object-based classification.

AB Satellite observations have shown greening trends in tundra in response to climate change, suggesting increases in productivity. To better understand the ability of remote sensing to detect climate impacts on tundra vegetation productivity, we applied a photosynthetic light use efficiency model to simulated climate change treatments of tundra vegetation. We examined changes in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and photosynthetic light use efficiency (epsilon) in experimental warming and moisture treatments designed to simulate climate change in northern Alaska. Plots were warmed either passively, using Open Top Chambers, or actively using electric heaters in the soil. In one set of plots water table depth was actively altered, while other plots were established in locations that were naturally wet or dry. Over two growing seasons, plot-level carbon flux and spectral reflectance measurements were collected, and the results were used to derive a light use efficiency model that could explore the effects of moisture and temperature treatments using remote sensing.
   Warming increased values of canopy greenness (NDVI) relative to control plots, this effect being more pronounced in wet plots than in dry plots. Light use efficiency (LUE), the relationship between absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and gross ecosystem production (CEP), was consistent across warming treatments, growing season, subsequent years, and sites. However, LUE was affected by vegetation type, which varied with moisture; plots in naturally dry locations showed reduced light use efficiency relative to moist plots. Additionally moss exhibited reduced LUE relative to vascular plants. Understory moss production, not accounted for by the usual definition of the fraction of absorbed PAR (f(APAR)), was found to be a significant part of total GEP, particularly in areas with low vascular plant cover. These results support the use of light use efficiency models driven by spectral reflectance for estimating GEP in tundra vegetation, provided effects of vegetation functional type (e.g. mosses versus vascular plants) and microtopography are considered.

AB Rapid changes of land use and land cover (WLC) in urban areas have become a major environmental concern due to environmental impacts, such as the reduction of green spaces and development of urban heat islands (UHI). Monitoring and management plans are required to solve this problem effectively. The Tabriz metropolitan area in Iran, selected as a case study for this research, is an example of a fast growing city. Multi-temporal images acquired by Landsat 4, 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors on 30 June 1989, 18 August 1998, and 2 August 2001 respectively, were corrected for radiometric and geometric errors, and processed to extract WLC classes and land surface temperature (LST). The relationship between temporal dynamics of LST and LULC was then examined. The temperature vegetation index (TVX) space was constructed in order to study the temporal variability of thermal data and vegetation cover. Temporal trajectory of pixels in the TVX space showed that most changes due to urbanization were observable as the pixels migrated from the low temperature-dense vegetation condition to the high temperature-sparse vegetation condition in the TVX space. The uncertainty analysis revealed that the trajectory analysis in the TVX space involved a class-dependant noise component. This emphasized the need for multiple WLC control points in the TVX space. In addition, this research suggests that the use of multi-temporal satellite data together with the examination of changes in the TVX space is effective and useful in urban WLC change monitoring and analysis of urban surface temperature conditions as long as the uncertainty is addressed.

AB The lack of maps depicting forest three-dimensional structure, particularly as pertaining to snags and understory shrub species distribution, is a major limitation for managing wildlife habitat in forests. Developing new techniques to remotely map snags and understory shrubs is therefore an important need. To address this, we first evaluated the use of LiDAR data for mapping the presence/absence of understory shrub species and different snag diameter classes important for birds (i.e. >= 15 cm, >= 25 cm and >= 30 cm) in a 30.000 ha mixed-conifer forest in Northern Idaho (USA). We used forest inventory plots, LiDAR-derived metrics, and the Random Forest algorithm to achieve classification accuracies of 83% for the understory shrubs and 86% to 88% for the different snag diameter classes. Second, we evaluated the use of LiDAR data for mapping wildlife habitat suitability using four avian species (one flycatcher and three woodpeckers) as case studies. For this, we integrated LiDAR-derived products of forest structure with available models of habitat suitability to derive a variety of species-habitat associations (and therefore habitat suitability patterns) across the study area. We found that the value of LiDAR resided in the ability to quantify 1) ecological variables that are known to influence the distribution of understory vegetation and snags, such as canopy cover, topography, and forest succession, and 2) direct structural metrics that indicate or suggest the presence of shrubs and snags, such as the percent of vegetation returns in the lower strata of the canopy (for the shrubs) and the vertical heterogeneity of the forest canopy (for the snags). When applied to wildlife habitat assessment, these new LiDAR-based maps refined habitat predictions in ways not previously attainable using other remote sensing technologies. This study highlights new value of LiDAR in characterizing key forest structure components important for wildlife, and warrants further applications to other forested environments and wildlife species.

AB A sequential model is developed to disaggregate microwave-derived soil moisture from 40 km to 4 km resolution using MODIS (Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer) data and subsequently from 4 km to 500 m resolution using ASTER (Advanced Scanning Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data. The 1 km resolution airborne data collected during the three-week National Airborne Field Experiment 2006 (NAFE'06) are used to simulate the 40 km pixels, and a thermal-based disaggregation algorithm is applied using 1 km resolution MODIS and 100 m resolution ASTER data. The downscaled soil moisture data are subsequently evaluated using a combination of airborne and in situ soil moisture measurements. A key step in the procedure is to identify an optimal downscaling resolution in terms of disaggregation accuracy and sub-pixel soil moisture variability. Very consistent optimal downscaling resolutions are obtained for MODIS aboard Terra, MODIS aboard Aqua and ASTER, which are 4 to 5 times the thermal sensor resolution. The root mean square error between the 500 m resolution sequentially disaggregated and ground-measured soil moisture is 0.062 vol./vol. with a bias of -0.045 vol./vol. and values ranging from 0.08 to 0.40 vol./vol.

AB A validation of the 2005 500 m MODIS vegetation continuous fields (VCF) tree cover product in the circumpolar taiga-tundra ecotone was performed using high resolution Quickbird imagery. Assessing the VCF's performance near the northern limits of the boreal forest can help quantify the accuracy of the product within this vegetation transition area. The circumpolar region was divided into 7 longitudinal zones and validation sites were selected in areas of varying tree cover where Quickbird imagery is available in Google Earth. Each site was linked to the corresponding VCF pixel and overlaid with a regular dot grid within the VCF pixel's boundary to estimate percent tree crown cover in the area. Percent tree crown cover was estimated using Quickbird imagery for 396 sites throughout the circumpolar region and related to the VCFs estimates of canopy cover for 2000-2005. Regression results of VCF inter-annual comparisons (2000-2005) and VCF-Quickbird image-interpreted estimates indicate that: (1) Pixel-level, inter-annual comparisons of VCF estimates of percent canopy cover were linearly related (mean R-2 = 0.77) and exhibited an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 10.1% and an average root mean square difference (RMSD) of 7.3%. (2) A comparison of image-interpreted percent tree crown cover estimates based on dot counts on Quickbird color images by two different interpreters were more variable (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 14.8%, RMSD = 18.7%) than VCF inter-annual comparisons. (3) Across the circumpolar boreal region, 2005 VCF-Quickbird comparisons were linearly related, with an R-2 = 0.57, a RMSE = 13.4% and a RMSD = 21.3%, with a tendency to over-estimate areas of low percent tree cover and anomalous VCF results in Scandinavia. The relationship of the VCF estimates and ground reference indicate to potential users that the VCFs tree cover values for individual pixels, particularly those below 20% tree cover, may not be precise enough to monitor 500 m pixel-level tree cover in the taiga-tundra transition zone.

AB Illegal logging is a major environmental and economic problem, and exceeds in some countries the amounts of legally harvested timber. In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, illegal logging increased and reforestation on abandoned farmland was widespread after the breakdown of socialism, and the region's forest cover trends remain overall largely unclear. Our goal here was to map forest cover change and to assess the extent of illegal logging and reforestation in the Ukrainian Carpathians. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ images and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to derive forest change trajectories between 1988 and 2007 for the entire Ukrainian Carpathians. We calculated logging and reforestation rates, and compared Landsat-based forest trends to official statistics and inventory maps. Our classification resulted in reliable forest/nonforest maps (overall accuracies between 97.1%-98.01%) and high clear cut detection rates (on average 89.4%). Forest cover change was widespread in the Ukrainian Carpathians between 1988 and 2007. We found forest cover increase in peripheral areas, forest loss in the interior Carpathians, and increased logging in remote areas. Overall, our results suggest that unsustainable forest use from socialist times likely persisted in the post-socialist period, resulting in a continued loss of older forests and forest fragmentation. Landsat-based forest trends differed substantially from official forest resource statistics. Illegal logging appears to have been at least as extensive as documented logging during the early 1990s and so-called sanitary clear-cuts represent a major loophole for overharvesting and logging in restricted areas. Reforestation and illegal logging are frequently not accounted for in forest resource statistics, highlighting limitations of these data. Combating illegal logging and transitioning towards sustainable forestry requires better monitoring and up-to-date accounting of forest resources, in the Carpathians and elsewhere in Eastern Europe, and remote sensing can be a key technology to achieve these goals.

AB Gross primary productivity (GPP) changes occur at different time-scales and due to various mechanisms such as variations in leaf area, chlorophyll content, rubisco activity, and stomatal conductance. Diagnostic estimates of primary productivity are obviously error prone when these changes are not accounted for. Additional complications arise when factors inuencing a biome-specific maximum light use efficiency (LUE) must be estimated over a large area. In these cases a direct estimation of ecosystem LUE could reduce uncertainty of GPP estimates. Here, we analyse whether a MODIS-based photochemical reectance index (PRI) is a useful proxy for the light use efficiency of a Mediterranean Quercus ilex forest. As the originally proposed reference band for PRI is not available on MODIS, we tested the reference bands 1 (620-670 nm), 4 (545-565 nm), 12 (546-556 nm), 13 (662-672 nm), and 14 (673-683 nm) using different atmospheric correction algorithms. We repeated the analysis with different temporal resolutions of LUE (half-hourly to daily). The strongest correlation between LUE and PRI was found when considering only a narrow range of viewing angles at a time (especially 0-10 degrees and 30-40 degrees). We found that the MODIS-based PRI was able to track ecosystem LUE even during severe summer time water limitation. For this Mediterranean-type ecosystem we could show that a GPP estimation based on PRI is a huge improvement compared to the MODIS GPP algorithm. In this study, MODIS spectral band 1 turned out to be the most suitable reference band for PRI, followed by the narrow red bands 13 and 14. As to date no universally applicable reference band was identified in MODIS-based PRI studies, we advocate thorough testing for the optimal band combination in future studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Satellite imagery is the major data source for regional to global land cover maps. However, land cover mapping of large areas with medium-resolution imagery is costly and often constrained by the lack of good training and validation data. Our goal was to overcome these limitations, and to test chain classifications, i.e.. the classification of Landsat images based on the information in the overlapping areas of neighboring scenes. The basic idea was to classify one Landsat scene first where good ground truth data is available, and then to classify the neighboring Landsat scene using the land cover classification of the first scene in the overlap area as training data. We tested chain classification for a forest/non-forest classification in the Carpathian Mountains on one horizontal chain of six Landsat scenes, and two vertical chains of two Landsat scenes each. We collected extensive training data from Quickbird imagery for classifying radiometrically uncorrected data with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVMs classified 8 scenes with overall accuracies between 92.1% and 98.9% (average of 96.3%). Accuracy loss when automatically classifying neighboring scenes with chain classification was 1.9% on average. Even a chain of six images resulted only in an accuracy loss of 5.1% for the last image compared to a reference classification from independent training data for the last image. Chain classification thus performed well, but we note that chain classification can only be applied when land cover classes are well represented in the overlap area of neighboring Landsat scenes. As long as this constraint is met though, chain classification is a powerful approach for large area land cover classifications, especially in areas of varying training data availability.

AB In this study, we explore the utility of data structures that facilitate efficient nearest neighbor searches for application in multi-source forest attribute prediction. Our trials suggest that the kd-tree in combination with exact search algorithms can greatly reduce nearest neighbor search time. Further, given our trial data, we found that enormous gain in search time efficiency, afforded by approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms, does not result in compromised kNN prediction. We conclude that by using the kd-tree, or similar data structure, and efficient exact or approximate search algorithms, the kNN method, and variants, are useful tools for mapping large geographic area's at a fine spatial resolution.

AB Biological Soil Crusts (BSCs), consisting of cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens and bryophytes in varying proportions, live within or immediately on top of the uppermost millimeters of soil, where they form a more or less firm aggregation of soil particles and organisms. They mainly occur in soils of and and semi-arid regions, which cover more than 35% of the earth's land surface and are assumed to play a major role as primary producers, C- and N-sinks and soil stabilizers.
   In order to establish a methodology for mapping of BSCs, their spectral characteristics with respect to different crust types were analyzed. The resulting reflectance spectra of different crust types had a shallow absorption feature centered around 680 nm in common, in which they differed from the spectra of bare soil.
   In October 2004, hyperspectral CAST data with a spatial resolution of I in were recorded in conjunction with field spectroscopic measurements in the Succulent Karoo, South Africa. Available spectral indices for Biological Soil Crusts were tested on the image but did not produce satisfying classifications. Therefore, an alternative approach was established based on spectral field data, field observations and the hyperspectral dataset. The newly developed Continuum Removal Crust Identification Algorithm (CRCIA) is based on small and narrow spectral characteristics, that were extracted by continuum removal and subsequently expressed as a set of logical conditions. Using this method, 16.2% of the area which covers 12 km(2) of gently sloping hills with some granite outcrops were classified as BSCs. Validation of the classification resulted in a Kappa index of 0.831.
   In a next step, the methodology will be tested with regard to scale-dependent effects and applied to images covering areas with additional types of BSCs and soil to develop a robust and generally applicable method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A lidar simulator has been applied to assess the performances of a satellite water vapour differential absorption lidar (DIAL) system. Measurements performed by the airborne Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft-and Raumfahrt (DLR) water vapour DIAL on 15 May 2002 during ESA's Water Vapour Lidar Experiment (WALEX), in combination with PSU/NCAR Mesoscale Model (MM5) output, were used to obtain backscatter and water vapour fields with high resolution and accuracy. These data and model output serve as input for the simulator, allowing for the performance of satellite DIAL under highly-inhomogeneous atmospheric conditions including clouds to be assessed. The airborne measurements show an intrusion of stratospheric air into the troposphere, and MM5 data used above the DLR Falcon airplane flight altitude are characterized by very high upper tropospheric humidity levels, comparable to those associated with strong mid-latitude transport events from the troposphere to the lowermost stratosphere. Results of the simulator reveal that the maximum systematic error does not exceed 5% up to 16 km, except in the presence of thick cirrus and mid level clouds with an optical thickness up to 2 and, occasionally, inside the dry stratospheric intrusion, while the random error is less than 20% up to 16 km when spatial measurement resolutions are applied that follow the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) threshold observational requirements for numerical weather prediction (NWP). The bias is even smaller if a drier upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) region from a reference atmosphere is considered. The results confirm the capability of satellite water vapour DIAL systems to retrieve thin structures of the tropospheric water vapour and particle backscatter fields, as well as its capability to provide low bias and random error measurements even in the presence of clouds.

AB Desert pavements can be detected through multi-spectral polarization measurements of reflected sunlight both in and out of the solar principle plane. The combination of polarization and color distinguishes desert pavements from other desert landforms and vegetation. Desert pavements linearly polarize and impart a blueness to sunlight reflected at visible wavelengths. The polarization and color of skylight reflected at high emission angles is also preserved. The polarization properties of desert pavements are dominated by Fresnel reflection at large phase angles and by multiple scattering at low phase angles, causing significant positive and small negative polarization, respectively.

AB Land Surface Models (LSM) have been designed to describe water and energy transfers at the soil-vegetation-atmosphere inter-face, and are therefore essential in many environmental disciplines. These numerical models, driven by the boundary conditions in the atmosphere and in the soil, require adequate knowledge of those vegetation and soil characteristics which are determinant in the characterisation of mass and energy transfers. In view of the fact that, firstly this information is often only partially known, and secondly the transfers are sometimes incorrectly represented, these models can rapidly drift and need to be regularly corrected. To this aim, remote sensing is a promising tool and many studies are currently devoted to the development of assimilation techniques to control their inputs or internal variables. The research presented in this paper contributes to this effort. Its ambition is to explore new methodologies, designed to make use of remote sensing thermal infrared data recorded from space. This study is based on the analysis of links between the characteristics of the diurnal cycle of the surface brightness temperature and the soil-atmosphere interface parameters and variables. The proposed methodology takes advantage of these temperatures cycling features, instead of absolute temperature values, to calibrate the LSM. The results show that the model parameters have a significant impact on the diurnal temperature dynamics, sometimes to a greater extent than on the temperature itself, and that these relationships have diurnal and seasonal variations. As a consequence, the use of TIR data for LSM calibration can be optimised by considering only those parts of the information which are really relevant to parameter calibration.

AB An inversion of linked radiative transfer models (RTM) through artificial neural networks (ANN) was applied to MODIS data to retrieve vegetation canopy water content (CWC). The estimates were calibrated and validated using water retrievals from AVIRIS data from study sites located around the United States that included a wide range of environmental conditions. The ANN algorithm showed good performance across different vegetation types, with high correlations and consistent determination coefficients. The approach outperformed a multiple linear regression approach used to independently retrieve the same variable. The calibrated algorithm was then applied at the MODIS 500 m scale to follow changes in CWC for the year 2005 across the continental United States, subdivided into three vegetation types (grassland, shrubland, and forest). The ANN estimates of CWC correlated well with rainfall, indicating a strong ecological response. The high correlations suggest that the inversion of RTM through an ANN provide a realistic basis for multi-temporal assessments of CWC over wide areas for continental and global studies.

AB Observations from visible, infrared and microwave satellite instruments are integrated to detect dust storm over northwestern China. Microwave measurements are used to detect the dust storm underneath ice clouds, while visible and infrared measurements are utilized for delineating the cloud-free dust systems. Detection is based on microwave polarized brightness temperature differences (Delta T-b=T-bv -T-bh) among two channels of 89 GHz and 23.8 GHz and infrared brightness temperature difference (BTD) between channels at 11 and 12 mu m. It is shown that the integrated approach is better than the method solely based on infrared BTD in storm detection, especially for those dust systems covered by ice clouds. This approach is applied for the Asia dust storms cases using the data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) onboard Aqua satellite.

AB An approach is presented for determining leaf area index (LAI) of a forest located at the desert fringe by using high spatial resolution imagery and by implementing values from a moderate spatial but high temporal resolution sensor. A 4-m spatial resolution multi-spectral IKONOS image was acquired under clear sky conditions on March 25, 2004. Normalized differences vegetation index (NDVI) and a linear mixture model were applied to calculate fractional vegetation cover (FVC). LAI was calculated using a non-linear relationship to FVC and then compared with ground truth measurements made in ten 1000 m(2) plots Using the tracing radiation and architecture of canopies (TRAC) canopy analyzer under bright and clear sky conditions during March and April, 2004. Calculated LAI, corrected with a measured clumping index, was highly correlated with measured LAI (R-2=0.79, p < 0.01). This approach was used to produce a 4-m resolution LAI map of the forest. The procedure was then applied to the MODIS 250-m resolution surface reflectance product, where MODIS LAI and VI products were used to calculate the extinction coefficient by inversion of the LAI-FVC relationship, and the extinction coefficient was then used to calculate LAI for moderate resolution. Histograms of resulting LAI distributions and descriptive statistics at the different spatial resolutions are compared. LAI spatial distribution at lower resolution was similar to that obtained at higher resolution and remained close to being normally distributed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An intercomparison of output from two models estimating spatially distributed surface energy fluxes from remotely sensed imagery is conducted. A major difference between the two models is whether the soil and vegetation components of the scene are treated separately (Two-Source Energy Balance; TSEB approach) or as a lumped composite (one-source approach; Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land; SEBAL) in the parameterization of radiative and turbulent exchanges with the overlying air. Comparisons are performed using data from two largescale field experiments covering sub-humid grassland (Southern Great Plains '97) and semi-arid rangeland (Monsoon '90) having very different landscape properties. In general, there was reasonable agreement between flux output from both models versus a handful of flux tower observations. However, spatial intercomparisons of model output over the full modeling domains yielded relatively large discrepancies (on the order of 100 W m(-2)) in sensible heat flux (H) that are related to land cover. In particular, bare soil and sparsely vegetated areas yielded the largest discrepancies, with TSEB fluxes being in better agreement with tower observations. Modifications to SEBAL inputs that reduced discrepancies with TSEB and observations for bare soil and shrub classes tended to increase differences for other land cover classes. In particular, improvements to SEBAL inputs of surface roughness for momentum tended to exacerbate errors with respect to observed fluxes. These results suggest that some of the simplifying assumptions in SEBAL may not be strictly applicable over the wide range in conditions present within these landscapes. An analysis of TSEB and SEBAL sensitivity to uncertainties in primary inputs indicated that errors in surface temperature or surface-air temperature differences had the greatest impact on H estimates. Inputs of secondary importance were fractional vegetation cover for TSEB, while for SEBAL, the selection of pixels representing wet and dry moisture end-member conditions significantly influenced flux predictions. The models were also run using input fields derived from both local and remote data sources, to test performance under conditions of varying ancillary data availability. In this case, both models performed similarly under both constraints. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional fire detection algorithms mainly rely on hot spot detection using thermal infrared (TIR) channels with fixed or contextual thresholds. Three solar reflectance channels (0.65 mu m, 0.86 mu m, and 2.1 mu m) were recently adopted into the MODIS version 4 contextual algorithm to improve the active fire detection. In the southeastern United States, where most fires are small and relatively cool, the MODIS version 4 contextual algorithm can be adjusted and improved for more accurate regional fire detection. Based on the MODIS version 4 contextual algorithm and a smoke detection algorithm, an improved algorithm using four TIR channels and seven solar reflectance channels is described. This approach is presented with fire events in the southeastern United States. The study reveals that the T-22 of most small, cool fires undetected by the MODIS version 4 contextual algorithm is lower than 310 K. The improved algorithm is more sensitive to small, cool fires in the southeast especially for fires detected at large scan angles. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We evaluated the use of EO-I Hyperion hyperspectral satellite imagery for mapping structure and floristic diversity in a Neotropical tropical dry forest as a way of assessing a region's ecological fingerprint. Analysis of satellite imagery provides a means to spatially appraise the dynamics of the structure and diversity of the forest. We derived optimal models for mapping canopy height, live aboveground biomass, Shannon diversity, basal area and the Holdridge Complexity Index from a dry season image. None of the evaluated models adequately estimated stem or species density. Due to the dynamic nature of the leaf phenology we found that for the application of remote sensing in Neotropical dry forests, the spectro-temporal domain (changes in the spectral signatures over time-season) must be taken into account when choosing imagery. The analyses and results presented here provide a means for rapid spatial assessment of structure and diversity characteristics from the microscale site level to an entire region.

AB Land-cover mapping efforts within the USGS Gap Analysis Program have traditionally been state-centered; each state having the responsibility of implementing a project design for the geographic area within their state boundaries. The Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project (SWReGAP) was the first formal GAP project designed at a regional, multi-state scale. The project area comprises the southwestern states of Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. The land-cover map/dataset was generated using regionally consistent geospatial data (Landsat ETM+ imagery (1999-2001) and DEM derivatives), similar field data collection protocols, a standardized land-cover legend, and a common modeling approach (decision tree classifier). Partitioning of mapping responsibilities amongst the five collaborating states was organized around ecoregion-based "mapping zones". Over the course of 2(1)/(2) field seasons approximately 93,000 reference samples were collected directly, or obtained from other contemporary projects, for the land-cover modeling effort. The final map was made public in 2004 and contains 125 land-cover classes. An internal validation of 85 of the classes, representing 91% of the land area was performed. Agreement between withheld samples and the validated dataset was 61% (KHAT=.60, n = 17,030). This paper presents an overview of the methodologies used to create the regional land-cover dataset and highlights issues associated with large-area mapping within a coordinated, multi-institutional management framework.

AB The Mojave Desert of southern California is under constant pressure from anthropogenic influences on atmospheric pollutants and land management. Previously, the spatial, temporal, and source characteristics of aerosols over the Mojave Desert have been examined using in situ observations; however, in situ observations lack spatial coverage, and the only long-term measurements of aerosol optical depth (AOD) needed for aerosol impact studies on the local climate and biota is the AERONET site at Rogers Dry Lake. In this study, we provide the first moderately high spatial resolution (17.6 x 17.6 km(2)) study of AOD over the Mojave Desert of southern California using satellite data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) for the period of March 2000 to October 2005. We have demonstrated the seasonality of AOD over the entire Mojave Desert, and the spatial and temporal variability of AOD from the average AOD at national parks, military installations, and dry lakes and playas. Statistically significant differences from the Mojave Desert mean AOD can be attributed to proximity to urban sources (e.g., Rogers Dry Lake is near the Los Angeles metropolitan area) and local sources (e.g., mineral extraction at Bristol Dry Lake). The western Mojave, generally around Rogers Dry Lake and Harper Dry Lake exhibited the most sustained pattern of seasonally high aerosol optical depths throughout the year. As a result, the AERONET site at Rogers Dry Lake should not be used as a site representative of the aerosol conditions over the entire Mojave Desert of southern California. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Satellites provide unique perspectives on aerosol global and regional spatial and temporal distributions, and offer compelling evidence that visibility and air quality are affected by particulate matter transported over long distances. The heights at which emissions are injected into the atmosphere are major factors governing downwind dispersal. In order to better understand the environmental factors determining injection heights of smoke plumes from wildfires, we have developed a prototype system for automatically searching through several years of MISR and MODIS data to locate fires and the associated smoke plumes and to retrieve injection heights and other relevant measurements from them. We are refining this system and assembling a statistical database, aimed at understanding how injection height relates to the fire severity and local weather conditions. In this paper we focus on our working proof-of-concept system that demonstrates how machine-leaming and data mining methods aid in processing of massive volumes of satellite data. Automated algorithms for distinguishing smoke from clouds and other aerosols, identifying plumes, and extracting height data are described. Preliminary results are presented from application to MISR and MODIS data collected over North America during the summer of 2004. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB South America's Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland, contains hundreds of thousands of geochemically diverse lakes, ranging from dilute to brackish to saline in composition. These lakes form the backbone of the habitat that supports the highly diverse flora and fauna of the Pantanal, yet the natural processes that create and destroy them are largely unknown. The quantities and types of lakes in the Pantanal and their spatial distribution are therefore essential, but missing information required to understand the dynamics of the Pantanal ecosystem. RADARSAT S I and S7, and JERS-1 imagery were integrated with field measurements of water geochemistry and characteristics of emergent aquatic vegetation for fresh and brackish lakes of the Nhecolandia region of the Brazilian Pantanal. A supervised classification was used to classify forest, pasture, bare soil, and lakes. A mask is then applied to produce an image of only lakes. The radar backscattering values were found to have a strong relationship with the emergent aquatic plant assemblages of the lakes-S1 imagery was the most useful. The plant assemblages, in turn, were observed to be strongly controlled by the total dissolved solids (TDS) and pH of the lakes. The relationships between backscattering values, plant assemblages, and geochemistry were then exploited to map the type and distribution of the lakes in the study area. Threshold rules were used to perform Level I and Level 2 classifications of the lakes. For the Level I classification, the go values of RADARSAT SI effectively separated brackish (10,000 > TDS > 1000 mg/kg) from fresh water lakes (TDS < 1000 mg/kg) with a total accuracy of 91%. For the Level 2 classification, the go values of RADARSAT SI effectively separated lakes into three geochemical groups: brackish (10,000 > TDS > 1000 mg/kg), hard with only Typha (1000 > TDS > 100 mg/kg), and fresh water lakes (TDS mg/kg < 100 mg/kg) with a total accuracy of 83%. Considering that the area is very remote and the lakes are very numerous, this may be the most feasible way to map lake type in the Pantanal. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluates the performance of the beta-test MODIS (MOD10A1) daily albedo product using in situ data collected in Greenland during summer 2004. Results indicate the beta-test product tracks the general seasonal variability in albedo but exhibits significant more temporal variability than observed at the stations. This may indicate problems with the cloud detection algorithm, and/or failure of the BRDF model to adequately model the bidirectional reflectance of snow. Comparisons with in situ observations at five automatic weather stations in Greenland indicate an overall RMSE of 0.067 for the Terra instrument and an RMSE of 0.075 on Aqua. The Terra-retrieved-albedo are slightly better correlated with the in situ data than the Aqua retrievals (r=0.79 versus r=0.77). Comparisons were also made between the MODIS daily albedo product and the MODIS 16-day albedo product (MOD43133). Results indicate general correspondence between the two products, with better agreement found using the Terra-retrieved-albedo than the Aqua-retrieved albedo. The reason for the differences in albedo between the Aqua and Terra satellites remains unclear. At the stations examined, both the Terra and Aqua retrievals were made at nearly the same time of the day and therefore the differences in albedo between the satellites cannot be explained by differences in solar illumination. Finally, the albedo derived using MODIS data and the direct estimation algorithm (DEA) was also compared with 2004 Greenland in situ data. Results from this comparison suggest that the DEA performs well as long as the solar zenith angle of the observation is not greater than 70 degrees. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The boreal forest contains almost half the total carbon pool of world forest ecosystems, and so has a very significant role in global biogeochemical cycles. The flux of greenhouse gases in and out of these forests is influenced strongly by disturbances such as diseases, logging and predominantly fire. It is important to quantify these disturbances to enable the modelling of major greenhouse gases. However, because of the remoteness and vastness of the boreal forest, little data is available on the type, extent, frequency and severity of these disturbances in Siberia. For burnt areas, two of the more responsive wavelengths are the short wave infra-red (SWIR) and the near infra-red (NIR). These produce a vegetation index, the normalised difference SWIR (NDSWIR) capable of detecting retrospective disturbances. Here we combine the NDSWIR from MODIS imagery acquired in the summer of 2003 with thermal anomaly data from 1992 to 2003 to detect and date areas which burnt at some point between 1992 and 2003. The semi-automated method is called SWIR and Thermal ANomalies for Detecting Disturbances (STANDD) and is complemented by an Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) differencing method using MODIS 2002 and 2003 imagery to ensure reliable detection of area burnt in the year of image acquisition (i.e. 2003). The area of this study covers approximately 3 million km(2) stretching from Lake Baikal in the south to the Laptev Sea in the north, above the Arctic Circle. Landsat ETM+ images were used to validate the shape and areal extent of the burnt areas resulting in an 81% overall accuracy with a kappa coefficient of agreement of 0.63. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB We explore the use of Hymap (hyperspectral mapper) to remotely map unique geothermal indicator minerals over the Brady-Desert Peak geothermal fields. Geothermal-related minerals and rocks such as sinter, tufa, and sulfates, display diagnostic characteristics in the visible and shortwave infrared; their presence and distribution can be used to guide more detailed fieldwork for geothermal exploration. The Brady-Desert Peak geothermal fields are located about 80 km east of Reno, Nevada in the Hot Springs Mountains. North-northeast-striking en-echelon faults offset Tertiary volcanic and lacustrine rocks. Two geothermal power plants produce electricity from two separate geothermal systems, one with numerous fumaroles and mudpots, the other showing no active surface expression of geothermal activity. Surface occurrences of gypsum, calcium-carbonate, hematite, and opaline silica were identified at both sites with the hyperspectral data; these minerals when considered together are indicative of geothermal activity at both sites. Mapping results were synthesized with other spatial data in a geographic information systems (GIS) database that was used to help draw structural interpretations of faulting and fault controls at the Brady-Desert Peak area. The same processing methods can be applied to new hyperspectral data sets for future exploration in the Great Basin, especially in areas that lack obvious thermal expressions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) cannot be measured directly from satellite observations but remote sensing can provide a reasonably good estimate of evaporative fraction (EF), defined as the ratio of ET and available radiant energy. It is feasible to estimate EF using a contextual interpretation of radiometric surface temperature (T-o) and normalized vegetation index (NDVI) from multiple satellites. Recent studies have successfully estimated net radiation (R-n) over large heterogeneous areas for clear sky days using only remote sensing observations. With distributed maps of EF and R-n, it is now possible to explore the feasibility and robustness of ET estimation from multiple satellites. Here we present the results of an extensive inter-comparison of spatially distributed ET and related variables (NDVI, T-o, EF and R-n) derived from MODIS and AVHRR sensors onboard EOS Terra, NOAA14 and NOAA16 satellites respectively. Our results show that although, NDVI and T. differ with the sensor response functions and overpass times, contextual space of NDVI-T-o diagram gives comparable estimates of EF. The utility of different sensors is demonstrated by 2 validating the estimated ET results to ground flux stations over the Southern Great Plains with a root mean square error of 53, 51 and 56.24 Wm(-2), and a correlation of 0.84, 0.79 and 0.77 from MODIS, NOAA16 and NOAA14 sensors respectively.

AB Measuring the wavelength position of the absorption feature of white micas in the 2200nm region is a useful tool in mapping the affects of hydrothermal alteration. However, this subtle wavelength shift is difficult to measure accurately using unmixing and matching algorithms that rely on spectral end members, because the wavelength position is uncorrelated to the general shape of the reflectance spectra of white micas. An alternative method is presented that uses pixel-dependent information only and that is based on extracting diagnostic spectral information of the mineral of interest through band ratios. Multiple regression analysis is then used to determine the relation between band ratios calculated from airborne imaging spectroscopy and the absorption wavelength of white micas measured in rock samples on the ground. The complicating effects of vegetation mixing with mineral signatures at the pixel level are addressed through a combination of band ratios that target the respective diagnostic absorptions. With this method the presence of white micas at the earth surface is estimated from two band ratios,L2168 nm/L2185 nm and L2005 nm/Lm2079nm, where band ratio L2005 nm/ L2079nm is proportional to the abundance of cellulose in spinifex vegetation. The absorption wavelength of white micas is then estimated from the two band ratios L2220 nm/L2202nm and L2237 nm/ L2220nm. The results of both band-ratio regression analyses can then be combined to show predicted wavelengths of white mica in the areas of highest probability of containing white mica.

AB Chlorophyll-a (Chl) concentration in the Taiwan Strait (TWS) and in the South China Sea (SCS) was estimated using time series of satellite data collected with the MODIS/Aqua and SeaWiFS instruments, and validated with in situ measurements from three cruises conducted in winter and summer 2004. For Chl between 0.1 and 10 mg m(-3), both SeaWiFS and MODIS agreed well with in situ data. Errors for turbid coastal waters were larger than for offshore waters but the overall RMS (root mean square) error in log scale was within 0.35. The percentage RMS error was much larger, varying between 60% and 170% for open ocean and most of the shallow (< 30 m), coastal regions. However, there was no large systematic error or significant bias in either satellite data set, and these numbers were comparable to those for other global oceans and not significantly larger than the algorithm "noise" (0.22 in RMS error in log scale). Further, SeaWiFS and MODIS showed similar spatial and temporal patterns between July 2002 and October 2004, as well as nearly identical concentrations for Chl between 0.1 and 4 mg m(-3). RMS difference between the two data sets of monthly mean Chl for several sub-regions was generally < 11% and < 0.05 (after logarithmic transformation). For each individual month, the statistics (mean, mode, median) of the two data sets for the entire study region (6-9 x 10(5) satellite pixels at similar to 1 km resolution) were very similar, with RMS differences typically between 30% and 40% and between 0.10 and 0.15 (after logarithmic transformation), where no significant bias was found. Therefore, it would be possible to continue the time series using only one sensor such as MODIS, in the eventual absence of SeaWiFS. Further research is needed to improve the remote sensing algorithms for application in turbid coastal waters. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Quantitative analysis of coastal marine benthic communities enables to adequately estimate the state of coastal marine environment, provide better evidence for environmental changes and describe processes that are conditioned by anthropogenic forces. Remote sensing could provide a tool for mapping bottom vegetation if the substrates are spectrally resolvable. We measured reflectance spectra of green (Cladophora glomerata), red (Furcellaria lumbricalis), and brown (Focus vesiculosus) macroalgae and used a bio-optical model in estimating whether these algae distinguish optically from each other, from sandy bottom or deep water in turbid water conditions of the Baltic Sea. The simulation was carried out for three different water types: (I) CDOM-rich coastal water, (2) coastal waters not directly impacted by high CDOM discharge from rivers but with high concentration of cyanobacteria, (3) open Baltic waters. Our modelling results indicate that the reflectance spectra of C. glomerata, F. lumhricalis, F. vesiculosus differ from each other and also from sand and deep water reflectance spectra. The differences are detectable by remote sensing instruments at spectral resolution of 10 nm and SNR better than 1000:1. Thus, the lowest depth limits where the studied macroalgae grow do not exceed the depth where such remote sensing instruments could potentially detect the spectral differences between the studied species.

AB Since the launch of the ENVISAT satellite in 2002, the Radar Altimetry Mission provides systematic observations of the Earth topography. Among the different goals of the ENVISAT Mission, one directly concerns land hydrology: the monitoring of the water levels of takes, wetlands, and rivers. The ENVISAT Geophysical Data Records products contain, over different type of surfaces, altimeter ranges derived from four specialized algorithms or retrackers. However, none of the retrackers are intended to the processing of the radar echoes over continental waters. A validation study is necessary to assess the performances of the different ENVISAT-derived water levels to monitor inland waters. We have selected four test-zones over the Amazon basin to achieve this validation study. We compare first the performances of these retracking algorithms to deliver reliable water levels for land hydrology. Comparisons with in-situ gauge stations showed that Ice-1 algorithm, based on the Offset Centre of Gravity technique, provides the more accurate water stages. Second, we examine the potentiality to combine water levels derived from different sensors (Topex/Poseidon, ERS-1 and -2, GFO). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Relationships between lake morphometric parameters and nighttime lake surface temperatures were investigated in North American temperate lakes using the ASTER kinetic temperature (AST08) product. Nighttime ASTER kinetic temperature measurements were found to be a good analogue for nighttime surface temperatures. Linear regression between ASTER and buoy-measured temperatures in a test lake were better during the evening (R-2=0.98) than the day (R-2=0.90), presumably due to the greater influence of radiation and latent heat fluxes during daylight hours. Nighttime lake surface temperatures measured in three ASTER scenes were significantly correlated to logarithm of lake area, maximum lake depth, Secchi depth (a measure of lake clarity) and lake order (a measure of lake connection with surface drainage), during October and November. Nighttime lake surface temperatures were significantly correlated only With lake area in July. We hypothesize that morphology was more strongly related to surface temperature in the fall months due to lake turnover during that season. This study suggests that satellite derived thermal data may be useful for calculation of lake heat budgets and evaporation rates, provided surface temperatures are measured in well-mixed lakes.

A parameterization scheme is realized based on a comprehensive bio-optical data set, including subsurface downwelling and upwelling irradiance spectra, absorption spectra of particle and dissolved substances, as well as chlorophyll and total suspended matter concentrations at 45 stations near Tokyo Bay between 1982 and 1984. The irradiance reflectance model is implemented with three-component inherent optical property submodels.
   In this parameterization scheme, an unsupervised classification was applied in the hyper-spectral space of reflectance, leading to three spectrally distinct optical water types. The reflectance model was parameterized for the entire data set, and then parameterized for each of the water types. The three sets of type-specific model parameters, which define corresponding IOP submodels, are believed to accommodate differences in the optical properties of the in-water constituents. The parameterized reflectance model was evaluated by both reconstructing measured reflectance spectra and solving for the nonlinear inverse problem to retrieve in-water constituent concentrations. The model accuracy was significantly improved in the forward direction for classified waters over that of non-classified waters, but no significant improvement was achieved in the retrieval accuracy (inverse direction). A larger data set with greater resolution of constituent inherent optical properties would likely improve the modeling results. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Surface-temperature (T) and emissivity (epsilon) estimation from remotely sensed mid-infrared (MIR: 3-5 mu m) data requires modifications to existing long-wave infrared (LWIR: 8-12 mu m) T/epsilon separation algorithms because of the significantly different characteristics of Planck's function between the MIR and LWIR wavelength regions and the strong effects of reflected solar irradiance in the MIR. A modified version of the normalized emissivity method (NEM), utilizing independently scaled maximum emissivities in each channel, was applied to thermal data acquired by the Multispectral Thermal Imager (MTI) with two MIR channels, J (3.81 mu m) and K (4.97 mu m), and three LWIR channels, L (8.26 mu m), M (8.65 mu m), and N (10.51 mu m). Atmosphere-free simulations of T and epsilon retrieval over a wide variety of terrestrial surfaces yielded T values within +/- 0.75 K of 'true T' in the range of 270-330 K and epsilon values within +/- 0.011 of true epsilon in channels L, M and N, and +/- 0.019 and +/- 0.023 in channels K and J, respectively. The algorithm was tested successfully using MTI data over the Mauna Loa caldera in Hawaii. Unconstrained effects of shading and unresolved shadows in channel J daytime data, and the strong atmospheric effects in channel K limit the application of the algorithm, in its present form, to night-time data.

AB The remote sensing of Earth surface changes is an active research field aimed at the development of methods and data products needed by scientists, resource managers, and policymakers. Fire is a major cause of surface change and occurs in most vegetation zones across the world. The identification and delineation of fire-affected areas, also known as burned areas or fire scars, may be considered a change detection problem. Remote sensing algorithms developed to map fire-affected areas are difficult to implement reliably over large areas because of variations in both the surface state and those imposed by the sensing system. The availability of robustly calibrated, atmospherically corrected, cloud-screened, geolocated data provided by the latest generation of moderate resolution remote sensing systems allows for major advances in satellite mapping of fire-affected area. This paper describes an algorithm developed to map fire-affected areas at a global scale using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance time series data. The algorithm is developed from the recently published Bi-Directional Reflectance Model-Based Expectation change detection approach and maps at 500 in the location and approximate day of burning. Improvements made to the algorithm for systematic global implementation are presented and the algorithm performance is demonstrated for southern African, Australian, South American, and Boreal fire regimes. The algorithm does not use training data but rather applies a wavelength independent threshold and spectral constraints defined by the noise characteristics of the reflectance data and knowledge of the spectral behavior of burned vegetation and spectrally confusing changes that are not associated with burning. Temporal constraints are applied capitalizing on the spectral persistence of fire-affected areas. Differences between mapped fire-affected areas and cumulative MODIS active fire detections are illustrated and discussed for each fire regime. The results reveal a coherent spatio-temporal mapping of fire-affected area and indicate that the algorithm shows potential for global application. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The space-time variability of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over the Amazon River basin is quantified through the bi-dimensional Fourier spectrum, and moment-scaling analysis of monthly imagery at 8 km resolution, for the period July 1981-November 2002. Monthly NDVI fields exhibit power law Fourier spectra, E(k)=ck(-beta), with k denoting the wavenumber, c the prefactor, and the scaling exponent. Fourier spectra exhibit two scaling regimes separated at approximately 29 km, above which NDVI exhibit long-range spatial correlations (0<beta<2),. and below which NDVI behaves like white noise in space (betasimilar or equal to0). Series of monthly values of c(t) and beta(t) exhibit high negative correlation (-0.88, P>0.99), which suggest their linkages in power laws, but also that E-t(k)=c(t)k(-beta(t)), with t the time index. Results show a significant negative simultaneous correlation (-0.82, P>0.95) between monthly series of average precipitation over the Amazon, (P(t)), and scaling exponents, beta(t); and high positive lagged correlation (0.63, P>0.95), between (P(t)) and (NDVI(t+3)). Parameters also reflect the hydrological seasonal cycle over Amazonia: during the wet season (November-March), beta(t) ranges between 0.9 and 1.15, while during the dry season (May-September), beta(t)similar or equal to1.30. These results reflect the more (less) coherent spatial effect of the dry (wet) season over Amazonia, which translates into longer (shorter)-range spatial correlations of the NDVI field, as witnessed by higher (lower) values of beta(t). At interannual timescales, both phases of ENSO reflect on both parameters, as beta(t) is higher during El Nino than during La Nina, due to the more coherent effects of El Nino-related dryness, whereas NDVI spatial variability is enhanced during La Nina, due to positive rainfall anomalies. Results from the moment-scale analysis indicate the existence of multi-scaling in the spatial variability of NDVI fields. Departures front single scaling exhibit also annual and interannual variability, which consistently reflect the effects from both phases of ENSO. Furthermore, departures from single scaling are independent of the order moment, q, as the PDF of departures scaled by the mean collapse to a unique distribution. These results point out that ideas of spatial scaling constitute a promising framework to synthesize important hydro-ecological processes of Arnazonia. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB While accurate information on ecosystem CO2 and water vapor exchange is available at eddy covariance flux tower sites, methods to expand predictions Of CO2 and energy exchange to regional or global scales with high fidelity are lacking. The main objective of this study was to examine the applicability of land surface and atmospheric products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for assessing the spatial variation in CO2 and water vapor fluxes for cloudless agricultural land pixels at the Island of Zealand, Denmark. The spatial distribution of green leaf area index, direct-beam and difftise solar radiation and air humidity was inferred on the basis of late morning MODIS data that was combined with afternoon AVHRR data to resolve the diurnal variation in air and surface temperature. These variables were used in a coupled "two-leaf' ecosystem model operating at an hourly time scale.
   The enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was strongly correlated with field measurements of green leaf area index (r(2)=0.91) and remained sensitive to variations in green biomass up to green leaf area indices of 4-5. Evaluation against standard meteorological data showed that instantaneous estimates of air temperature, actual vapor pressure and incoming solar radiation could be retrieved with overall root mean square errors of 2.5 degreesC, 138.3 Pa and 47.7 W m(-2), respectively. The combination of late morning and afternoon inferences made it possible to resolve the diurnal course in key model parameters, and predicted rates of ecosystem CO2 and water vapor exchange were comparable to eddy covariance measurements at a single flux tower. A large spatial diversity in CO2 and water vapor exchange was maintained throughout the study period due to significant regional variations in meteorological input variables and large spatial differences in canopy development. The results of this study stress the necessity of pixel based estimates for an accurate evaluation of regional budgets Of CO2 and water vapor exchange. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Modeling of forest carbon (C) dynamics requires precise information regarding when a disturbance occur-red and the age of regeneration present. Generally, this information is obtained in the age class attribute of forest inventories; however forest inventories can become quickly outdated when disturbance events are not continuously integrated into the database. In this study, Landsat ETM+ image data and Tasseled Cap index values were used to estimate the age of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands from the approximate time of disturbance to 20 years of regeneration. An image segmentation procedure aided the removal of pixels representative of residual forest and other noncharacteristic stand conditions within forest inventory polygons, in order to isolate the pixels representative of regenerating harvested forest. A stepwise multivariate regression procedure was used to estimate stand age for harvested areas, and an R-2 of 0.68 (with a standard error of less than 2.4 years) was computed. This transferable approach provides useful information for forest C accounting when the year of disturbance, or the age of subsequent regeneration, is required for estimating C stocks.

AB Accurate solar irradiance data are not only of particular importance for the assessment of the radiative forcing of the climate system, but also absolutely necessary for efficient planning and operation of solar energy systems. Within the European project Heliosat-3, a new type of solar irradiance scheme is developed. This new type will be based on radiative transfer models (RTM) using atmospheric parameter information retrieved from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite (Clouds, ozone, water vapour) and the ERS-2/ENVISAT satellites (aerosols, ozone).
   This paper focuses on the description of the clear-sky module of the new scheme, especially on the integrated use of a radiative transfer model. The linkage of the clear-sky module with the cloud module is also briefly described in order to point out the benefits of the integrated RTM use for the all-sky situations. The integrated rise of an RTM within the new Solar Irradiance Scheme SOLIS is applied by introducing a new fitting function called the modified Lambert-Beer (MLB) relation. Consequently, the modified Lambert-Beer relation and its role for an integrated RTM use are discussed. Comparisons of the calculated clear-sky irradiances with ground-based measurements and the current clear-sky module demonstrate the advantages and benefits of SOLIS. Since SOLIS can provide spectrally resolved irradiance data, it can be used for different applications. Beside improved information for the planning of solar energy systems, the calculation of photosynthetic active radiation, UV index, and illuminance is possible. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB The three-dimensional structure of a coniferous shoot gives rise to multiple scattering of light between the needles of the shoot, causing the shoot spectral reflectance to differ from that of a flat leaf Forest reflectance models based on the radiative transfer equation handle shoot level clumping by correcting the radiation attenuation coefficient with a clumping index. The clumping index causes a reduction in the interception of radiation by the canopy at a fixed leaf area index (LAI). In this study, we show how within-shoot multiple scattering is related to shoot scale clumping and derive a similar, but wavelength dependent, correction to the scattering coefficient. The results provide a method for integrating shoot structure into current radiative transfer equation based forest reflectance models. The method was applied to explore the effect of shoot scale clumping on canopy spectral reflectance using simple model canopies with a homogeneous higher level structure. The clumping of needles into shoots caused a wavelength dependent reduction in canopy reflectance, as compared to that of a leaf canopy with similar interception. This is proposed to be one reason why coniferous and broad-leaved canopies occupy different regions in the spectral space and exhibit different dependency of spectral vegetation indices on LAI.

AB In this paper, we present a methodology to map classes of degraded forest in the Eastern Amazon. Forest degradation field data, available in the literature, and I-m resolution IKONOS image were linked with fraction images (vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), soil and shade) derived from spectral mixture models applied to a Satellite Pour L'observation de la Terre (SPOT) 4 multispectral image. The forest degradation map was produced in two steps. First, we investigated the relationship between ground (i.e., field and IKONOS data) and satellite scales by analyzing statistics and performing visual analyses of the field classes in terms of fraction values. This procedure allowed us to define four classes of forest at the SPOT 4 image scale, which included: intact forest; logged forest (recent and older logged forests in the field); degraded forest (heavily burned, heavily logged and burned forests in the field); and regeneration (old heavily logged and old heavily burned forest in the field). Next, we used a decision tree classifier (DTC) to define a set of rules to separate the forest classes using the fraction images. We classified 35% of the forest area (2097.3 km(2)) as intact forest. Logged forest accounted for 56% of the forest area and 9% of the forest area was classified as degraded forest. The resultant forest degradation map showed good agreement (86% overall accuracy) with areas of degraded forest visually interpreted from two IKONOS images. In addition, high correlation (R-2 = 0.97) was observed between the total live aboveground biomass of degraded forest classes (defined at the field scale) and the NPV fraction image. The NPV fraction also improved our ability to mapping of old selectively logged forests. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Accurate mapping of land cover at continental to global scales is currently limited by our ability to exploit the spatial, temporal, and radiometric characteristics of the available satellite data. Many ecologically and biogeochemically important landscape features are spatially extensive, but occur at scales much smaller than the similar to1-km footprint of wide-swath, polar orbiting radiometers. This is especially true for land cover changes associated with human activities. Satellite instruments that offer the appropriate spatial detail have much smaller swaths and longer repeat times, resulting in compositing intervals that are too large to resolve the time scales of these changes. In addition, the cost and effort associated with acquisition and processing of high-resolution data for large areas is often prohibitive. Methods for taking advantage of information contained in multiple-scale observations by combining data from high-resolution and moderate resolution sensors are thus of great current interest.
   In this paper, we retrieve land cover distributions in two different parts of the Brazilian Amazon region by estimating relationships between land cover fractions derived from 30-m resolution ETM+ and reflectance data from similar to1-km resolution MODIS and MISR. The scaling relationships are derived using a Bayesian-regularized artificial neural network (ANN) and compared to results using linear unmixing (LU). We explore the simultaneous use of two significant independent variables in terrestrial optical remote sensing, wavelength, and sun-sensor geometry, by combining nadir-adjusted MODIS reflectances in seven bands (VIS-SWIR) with multiangular (-71degrees to +71degrees) bidirectional reflectance data from MISR. This research was motivated by evidence from modeling and field studies demonstrating that: (a) the angular dependence of reflectance (e.g., from MISR) contains information about the structural composition of canopies that is complementary to the wavelength dependence; and (b) the SWIR portion of the spectrum (e.g., from MODIS) is sensitive to canopy moisture and shading conditions and, therefore, to the successional status of the ecosystem. This case study, using the Bayesian artificial neural network with combined MODIS-MISR data to estimate sub-pixel land cover fractions, yielded a quantitative improvement over spectral linear unmixing of single-angle, multispectral data. Our results suggest potential for broad-scale applicability despite a number of challenges related to tropical atmospheric conditions. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study explores the combined application of remote sensing, spatial metrics and spatial modeling to the analysis and modeling of urban growth in Santa Barbara, California. The investigation is based on a 72-year time series data set compiled from interpreted historical aerial photography and from IKONOS satellite imagery. Spatial metrics were used both specifically to assess the impact of urban development in four administrative districts, and generally to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban growth. The metrics quantify the temporal and spatial properties of urban development, and show definitively the impacts of growth constraints imposed on expansion by topography and by local planning efforts. The SLEUTH urban growth and land use change model was calibrated using the multi-temporal data sets for the entire study region. The calibrated model allowed us to fill gaps in the discontinuous historical time series of urban spatial extent, since maps and images were available only for selected years between 1930 and 2001. The model also allowed a spatial forecast of urban growth to the year 2030. The spatial metrics provided a detailed description of the accuracy of the model's historical simulations that applied also to forecasts of future development. The results illustrate the utility of modeling in explaining the amount and spatial pattern of urban growth. Even using modeling, however, the forecasting of urban development remains problematic and could benefit from further research on spatial metrics and their incorporation into the model calibration process. The combined approach using remote sensing, spatial metrics and urban modeling is powerful, and may prove a productive new direction for the improved understanding, representation and modeling of the spatiotemporal forms due to the process of urbanization.

AB Thermal remote sensing has been used over urban areas to assess the urban heat island, to perform land cover classifications and as input for models of urban surface atmosphere exchange. Here, we review the use of thermal remote sensing in the study of urban climates, focusing primarily on the urban heat island effect and progress made towards answering the methodological questions posed by Roth et al. [International Journal of Remote Sensing 10 (1989) 1699]. The review demonstrates that while some progress has been made, the thermal remote sensing of urban areas has been slow to advance beyond qualitative description of thermal patterns and simple correlations. Part of the difficulty lies in the tendency to use qualitatively based land use data to describe the urban surface rather than the use of more fundamental surface descriptors. Advances in the application of thermal remote sensing to natural and agricultural surfaces suggest insight into possible methods to advance techniques and capabilities over urban areas. Improvements in the spatial and spectral resolution of current and next-generation satellite-based sensors, in more detailed surface representations of urban surfaces and in the availability of low cost, high resolution portable thermal scanners are expected to allow progress in the application of urban thermal remote sensing to the study of the climate of urban areas.

AB Sea surface temperature (SST) patterns along the west India shelf, extending from 8degrees to 24degreesN, are analyzed during 1993-1996 to characterize seasonal variability using the advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) SST, momentum and heat fluxes derived from ERS-1 winds and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. During winter monsoon (December-March), a 4-year mean SST spatial pattern shows a strong cooling north of 15degreesN due to surface heat depletion, while warm SSTs evolve in the south due to the intrusion of warm equatorial water. Cold water occupies the entire shelf during summer monsoon, with high degree of SST cooling dominating the Kerala coast, where Ekman pumping and upwelling promoted by the dominant alongshore wind stress component overwhelms the surface heat loss. The spectral analysis reveals semiannual and annual peaks in SST and forcing functions, which highlight the influence of monsoon forcing on the SST variability along the west India shelf.

AB A major focus in global change research is to quantify the amount of gaseous and particulate pollutants emitted from terrestrial vegetation fires. Determination of the emitted radiant energy released during biomass combustion episodes (the so-called fire radiative energy or FRE) has been suggested as a new tool for determining variations in biomass combustion rates and the rate of production of atmospheric pollutants. We review the physical principals behind the remote determination of FRE and present an alternative method for its derivation via analysis of 'fire pixel' radiances in the middle infrared spectral region. We compare our method to the existing FRE retrieval approach used in the EOS Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) fire products, and to retrievals of FRE based on derived fire temperature and area made via the so-called Bi-spectral method. We test each FRE retrieval method using both simulated data and imagery from a new experimental space mission, the Bi-spectral InfraRed Detection (BIRD) small satellite, which has sensors specifically designed for the study of active fires. We analyse near simultaneous MODIS and BIRD data of the fires that burned around Sydney, Australia in January 2002. Despite the markedly different pixel size and spectral coverage of these sensors, where the spatial extent of the fire pixel groups detected by MODIS and BIRD are similar, the derived values of FRE for these fires agree to within +/- 15%. However, in certain fires, the lower spatial resolution of MODIS appears to prevent many of the less intensely radiating fire pixels being detected as such, meaning MODIS underestimates FRE for these fires by up to 46% in comparison to BIRD. Though the FRE release of each of these low intensity fire pixels is relatively low, their comparatively large number makes their overall FRE significant. Thus, total FRE release of the Sydney fires on 5 January 2002 is estimated to be 6.5 x 10(9) J s(-1) via BIRD but 4.0 x 10(9) J s(-1) via MODIS. The ability of BIRD to resolve individual fire fronts further allows the first accurate calculation of 'radiative' fireline intensity from spaceborne measurements, providing values of 15-75 kJ s(-1) m(-1) for fire fronts that are up to 9 kin in length. Finally, we analyse the effectiveness of the satellite-based FRE retrieval methods in estimating the FRE from the active flaming and smouldering components only (FREActive, believed to be proportional to the rate of biomass combustion), despite the sensor receiving additional radiance from the 'cooling ground'. The MIR radiance method appears particularly strong in this regard, allowing FREActive to be estimated to within +/- 30% in the range 100-100,000 J s(-1) m(-2). These results provide further confidence in the ability of spacebome missions to derive physically meaningful values of FRE that could be used to support biomass burning emissions inventories. Future comparisons between FRE derived via MODIS and those from higher spatial resolution BIRD or airborne imagery may allow the MODIS-derived FRE values to be 'calibrated' for any systematic underestimation. We therefore expect FRE to become an important tool for enhancing global studies of terrestrial vegetation fires with infrared remote sensing, particularly as the majority of large fires are now imaged four times per day via the MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft.

AB This paper presents the analysis of radiative transfer assumptions underlying moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) algorithm for the case of spatially heterogeneous broadleaf forests. Data collected by a Boston University research group during the July 2000 field campaign at the Earth Observing System (EOS) core validation site, Harvard Forest, MA, were used for this purpose. The analysis covers three themes. First, the assumption of wavelength independence of spectral invariants of transport equation, central to the parameterization of the MODIS LAI and FPAR algorithm, is evaluated. The physical interpretation of those parameters is given and an approach to minimize the uncertainties in its retrievals is proposed. Second, the theoretical basis of the algorithm was refined by introducing stochastic concepts which account for the effect of foliage clumping and discontinuities on LAI retrievals. Third, the effect of spatial heterogeneity in FPAR was analyzed and compared to FPAR variation due to diurnal changes in solar zenith angle (SZA) to asses the validity of its static approximation.

AB Soil salinity caused by natural or human-induced processes is a major environmental hazard. The global extent of primary salt-affected soils is about 955 M ha, while secondary salinization affects some 77 M ha, with 58% of these in irrigated areas. Nearly 20% of all irrigated land is salt-affected, and this proportion tends to increase in spite of considerable efforts dedicated to land reclamation. This requires careful monitoring of the soil salinity status and variation to curb degradation trends, and secure sustainable land use and management. Multitemporal optical and microwave remote sensing can significantly contribute to detecting temporal changes of salt-related surface features. Airborne geophysics and ground-based electromagnetic induction meters, combined with ground data, have shown potential for mapping depth of salinity occurrence. This paper reviews various sensors (e.g. aerial photographs, satellite- and airborne multispectral sensors, microwave sensors, video imagery, airborne geophysics, hyperspectral sensors, and electromagnetic induction meters) and approaches used for remote identification and mapping of salt-affected areas. Constraints on the use of remote sensing data for mapping salt-affected areas are shown related to the spectral behaviour of salt types, spatial distribution of salts on the terrain surface, temporal changes on salinity, interference of vegetation, and spectral confusions with other terrain surfaces.
   As raw remote sensing data need substantial transformation for proper feature recognition and mapping, techniques such as spectral unmixing, maximum likelihood classification, fuzzy classification, band ratioing, principal components analysis, and correlation equations are discussed. Lastly, the paper presents modelling of temporal and spatial changes of salinity using combined approaches that incorporate different data fusion and data integration techniques.

AB The airborne Millimeter-wave Imaging Radiometer (MIR) and MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) measurements over the Arctic region and the Midwest region of the US are used to derive surface emissivities xi(nu) for three frequencies, nu = 89, 150, and 220 GHz, as well, as Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and R87 (0.87-mum reflectance). These derived parameters are compared with parameters estimated from near concurrent measurements made by the SSMI and SSM/T-2 over snow-covered areas. It is shown that the MIR-estimated xi(nu) values at nu = 89 and 150 GHz agree well with those estimated from the SSM/T-2 at nu = 91 and 150 GHz, respectively. Low MIR-estimated (v) values are generally associated with high NDSI and R87 over the snow-covered areas. Over forested areas, more fluctuations in the values of MIR-estimated xi(nu), NDSI and R87, as well as a reduction in polarization index (PI) at 37 and 85 GHz are observed.
   Both observations and results from radiative transfer calculations show a change in the difference between brightness temperatures (T-b) at 19 and 37 GHz, as well as PI at 37 and 85 GHz, when measured at satellite altitudes and at the surface. The amplitude of the T-b difference and PI is reduced by about 10 -- 15% from surface to high altitudes when integrated water vapor is less than or equal to 1.5 g/cm(2). This effect is readily correctable and requires consideration when validating satellite retrieval algorithms based on surface and low-elevation aircraft measurements. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Recent developments in interferometric radar remote sensing provide a method for deriving detailed topographic and slope information for fault-scarp detection. In October 1996, the airborne TOPSAR instrument [IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sens., 30 (1992) 933] was flown over southwest Nevada and east-central California. Topography calculated from TOPSAR data are in the form of a high-resolution (5-mi spatial grid) digital elevation model (DEM). In this study, we focus upon the large, steep fault scarps that cut alluvium and alluvial fans, in Fish Lake Valley, east of the White Mountains of Nevada- California. A series of topographic profiles extracted from the DEM reveal that the larger fault scarps are greater than 40 in in height and that the average midsection slope angle for all measured scarps is approximately 23degrees. These large scarps are the product of multiple offsets rather than a single event. Other relevant geomorphic features present in the digital topography include splays and benches along the main fault, levees, cutbanks, gullies incising fault scarp slopes, shutterridges, offset drainage, and small normal faults with scarp heights of only 4-6 m. Field work corroborated general geomorphologic landforms, confirmed fault-scarp morphometry, and aided the evaluation of the accuracy of the DEM. We are also able to assess fault segmentation models that divide the Fish Lake Valley fault zone (FLVFZ) into discrete segments based upon surface-rupture characteristics.

AB One of the annual land cover products to be made from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data is the vegetation continuous fields layers. Of these fields, one is a global percent tree cover map. Using field measurements, IKONOS data, Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data, and ancillary map sources, a tree cover map was made and validated for two WRS path/rows in Western Province, Zambia. This map will be used in validating the 500-m global MODIS tree cover product. The map was made at the 30-m Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) resolution and also scaled up to 250- and 500-m resolutions. Five IKONOS images were classified into crown cover/no crown cover maps at 4-m resolution. These maps were aggregated to 30 m to create a continuous training data set of percent crown cover. Three dates of ETM+ data were acquired to predict percent crown cover using a regression tree algorithm. Comparisons of training accuracies and field data to ETM+ tree estimates yielded root mean square errors (rinse) of similar to +/- 10% crown cover. When aggregating the 30-m map to 250- and 500-m MODIS cell sizes, the training errors are more than halved. The final 250-m map was assessed using a structural vegetation map of the area and an overall rmse of 8.5% is estimated. The 250-m map was sampled and used to derive a tree cover continuous field product using 3 Level 113 MODIS time slices, approximating the acquisitions of the ETM+ data. The results are promising as an overall root mean square error between the ETM+ derived tree crown cover map and an aggregated MODIS 500-m map was 5.2%. Results from this test in Zambia show that the MODIS 250-m bands should allow for improved depictions of percent tree cover. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Light detection and ranging (lidar) data provide accurate measurements of forest canopy structure in the vertical plane; however, current lidar sensors have limited coverage in the horizontal plane. Landsat data provide extensive coverage of generalized forest structural classes in the horizontal plane but are relatively insensitive to variation in forest canopy height. It would, therefore, be desirable to integrate lidar and Landsat data to improve the measurement, mapping, and monitoring of forest structural attributes. We tested five aspatial and spatial methods for predicting canopy height, using an airborne lidar system (Aeroscan) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data: regression, kriging, cokriging, and kriging and cokriging of regression residuals. Our 200-km(2) study area in western Oregon encompassed Oregon State University's McDonald-Dunn Research Forest, which is broadly representative of the age and structural classes common in the region. We sampled a spatially continuous lidar coverage in eight systematic patterns to determine which lidar sampling strategy would optimize lidar-Landsat integration in western Oregon forests: transects sampled at 2000, 1000, 500, and 250 m frequencies, and points sampled at these same spatial frequencies. The aspatial regression model results, regardless of sampling strategy, preserved actual vegetation pattern, but underestimated taller canopies and overestimated shorter canopies. The spatial models, kriging and cokriging, produced less biased results than regression but poorly reproduced vegetation pattern, especially at the sparser (2000 and 1000 m) sampling frequencies. The spatial model predictions were more accurate than the regression model predictions at locations < 200 m from sample locations. Cokriging, using the ETM+ panchromatic band as the secondary variable, proved slightly more accurate than kriging. The integrated models that kriged or cokriged regression residuals were preferable to either the aspatial or spatial models alone because they preserved the vegetation pattern like regression yet improved estimation accuracies above those predicted from the regression models alone. The 250-m point sampling strategy proved most optimal because it oversampled the landscape relative to the geostatistical range of actual spatial variation, as indicated by the sample semivariograms, while making the sample data volume more manageable. We concluded that an integrated modeling strategy is most suitable for estimating and mapping canopy height at locations unsampled by lidar, and that a 250-m discrete point sampling strategy most efficiently samples an intensively managed forested landscape in western Oregon.

AB Since April 1998, the VEGETATION/SPOT-4 sensor has acquired global observations at kilometer scale in four optical spectral bands on a daily basis. Its large field of view results in a strong dependency of surface reflectances on the Sun-target-sensor geometry. Our objective is to define a method to remove this anisotropy during the processing of 10-day syntheses derived from data acquired at every VEGETATION orbit pass. This article investigates the concepts that were developed for AVHRR/NOAA, POLDER/ADEOS, and MODIS/ TERRA. The investigation is based on the statistical analysis of 18,000 simulated time series of red and near infrared reflectances, close to the ones acquired on various land classes by the VEGETATION sensor under different geometric, cloudiness, and atmospheric conditions. Conclusions are reached on the successive key stages that are required for the removal of surface reflectance anisotropy during the processing of syntheses. Firstly, we suggest to separate the time window devoted to the retrieval of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (BRDFs) from a second one (shorter) that is used for combining the most recent observations. Secondly, we verify the robustness of the Roujean's BRDF model through various angular sampling, land classes, cloudiness, and atmospheric noise. Thirdly, we improve the stability of the formula that normalises reflectances at nadir views. Fourthly, we show that a simple averaging is relevant to combine the observations after normalisation. The comparison with the common Maximum Value Compositing (MVC) method shows that the normalisation of directional effects greatly improves both consistency and accuracy in time series of surface reflectances. Despite the use of two time windows that allows to increase the efficiency of BRDF retrieval, anisotropy removal is still not possible in many cloudy regions of the world. The associated Part II article exposes a method that is fully operational on a 10-day basis under high cloudiness conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Effects of landsat 5 thematic mapper and Landsat 7 enhanced thematic

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID DRIFT
AB The Thematic Mapper (TM) instruments onboard Landsats 4 and 5 provide high-quality imagery appropriate for many different applications, including land cover mapping, landscape ecology, and change detection. Precise calibration was considered to be critical to the success of the Landsat 7 mission and, thus, issues of calibration were given high priority during the development of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). Data sets from the Landsat 5 TM are not routinely corrected for a number of radiometric and geometric artifacts, including memory effect, gain/bias, and interfocal plane misalignment. In the current investigation, the effects of correcting vs. not correcting these factors were investigated for several applications. Gain/bias calibrations were found to have a greater impact on most applications than did memory effect calibrations. Correcting interfocal plane offsets was found to have a moderate effect on applications. On June 2, 1999, Landsats 5 and 7 data were acquired nearly simultaneously over a study site in the Niobrara, NE area. Field radiometer data acquired at that site were used to facilitate crosscalibrations of Landsats 5 and 7 data. Current findings and results from previous investigations indicate that the internal calibrator of Landsat 5 TM tracked instrument gain well until 1988. After this, the internal calibrator diverged from the data derived from vicarious calibrations. Results from this study also indicate very good agreement between prelaunch measurements and vicarious calibration data for all Landsat 7 reflective bands except Band 4. Values are within about 3.5% of each other, except for Band 4, which differs by 10%. Coefficient of variation (CV) values derived from selected targets in the imagery were also analyzed. The Niobrara Landsat 7 imagery was found to have lower CV values than Landsat 5 data, implying that lower levels of noise characterize Landsat 7 data than current Landsat 5 data. It was also found that following radiometric normalization, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery and classification products of Landsats 5 and 7 were very similar. This implies that data from the two sensors can be used to measure and monitor the same landscape phenomena and that Landsats 5 and 7 data can be used interchangeably with proper caution. In addition, it was found that difference imagery produced using Landsat 7 ETM+ data are of excellent quality. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new water-turbidity index (WTI) based on multispectral images was developed and tested at Kushiro Mire, eastern Hokkaido, Japan. An algorithm for turbidity estimation was developed and applied to Landsat TM images to monitor the turbid water on the mire surface during the snow-melting season. We used spectral mixture analysis (SMA) to produce a turbidity estimation model. The SMA "unmixes" a mixed pixel determining the fractions due to each spectral end member. In this study, we used four end members (1, alder; 3, reed; 3, high-concentration turbid water (485 ppm); 4, low-concentration turbid water(10 ppm) measured in the test site. The WTI was determined by the following equation: WTI = a(max)/(a(max) + a(min)), where a(max) is abundance of high-concentration turbid water and a(min) is abundance of low concentration turbid water. The end-member spectra of alder and reed were measured in the laboratory using specimens collected at the test site. The spectrum of turbid water was measured at the test sites. The relative abundance of each end member was estimated based on this spectral information using SMA. The same formula was applied to Landsat TM images. Then we applied the WTI equation to the end-member images to obtain a WTI map. In the mire wetland region, turbid water spreads under alder trees and reed grasses. Tb verify our turbidity estimation method based on WTI under these conditions, we constructed a small experimental wetland consisting of mixed stands of alder acid reed. WTI was calculated from the mixed spectrum of this "artificial wetland" and the regression curve for the relation between WTI and the actual turbidity was determined (R-2=.91). Finally, this regression equation was used to derive a turbidity map from the WTI image. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The data also illustrated that, under clear sky and constant vegetation conditions, this difference is well correlated with surface soil moisture. However, the correlation decreased when the same comparison was made under changing vegetation conditions. To investigate the possibility of deriving component surface temperatures (soil and vegetation) using dual-angle observations of directional radiative temperature, two radiative transfer models (RTM) with different degrees of complexity were used. The results showed that despite their differences, the two models performed similarly in predicting the directional radiative temperature at a third angle. In contrast to other investigations, our study indicated that the impact of ignoring the cavity effect term is not very significant. However, omitting the contribution of the incoming long-wave radiation on measured directional radiance seemed to have a much larger impact. Finally, sensitivity analysis showed that an accuracy of better than 10% on the plant area index (PAI) was required for achieving a precision of 1 K for inverted vegetation temperature. An error of 1 K in measured directional radiative temperature can lead to an error of about 1 K in the soil and vegetation temperatures derived by inverting the RTM. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS): with sis thermal infrared channels in the 8-14 mum window: was flown over the Barrax test site, Spain, in the framework of the DAIS Experiment in the summer of 1998. Atmospheric correction of the DAIS thermal channels was performed by means of local radiosonde measurements and a radiative transfer model. Ground measurements of temperature and emissivity for six selected spots (two bare soils: two water bodies, and two vegetated fields) were conducted with the objective of providing calibration and validation targets. Three targets were used for a linear ground calibration of the DAIS thermal channels. With the ground-calibrated images, surface temperatures and channel emissivities were retrieved using a temperature-emissivity separation algorithm. We applied the Adjusted Normalized Emissivity Method (ANEM) in which an initial maximum emissivity was assumed for each surface type according to ground emissivity measurements. The other three targets were used to test the accuracy of the ground calibration and the ANEM method. The derived temperatures and channel emissivities were mostly within +/-0.005 and +/-1 degreesC of the measured values, respectively. Such results are comparable to other. methods for temperature and emissivity separation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. Ail rights reserved.

AB The complex architecture of conifer species affects the radiation scattering processes that influence the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) characteristics. An interesting BRDF signature is the hot spot effect that yields a maximum of reflectance in the sun direction. It has been shown that the hot spot phenomenon is sensitive to the foliage structure. The present work introduces the G-function and HOt SpoT (GHOST) model that simulates the BRDF of boreal forest in accounting for the arrangement and the structure of the stems. The model represents the medium by a distribution of conical crowns whose size and shape are accounted for in the G-function expression. GHOST compares quite well with airborne POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) reflectances acquired during the BOREAS experiment at various scale resolutions ranging from 2 (helicopter) up to 35 m (aircraft). The inversion procedure exploits the multidirectionality of measurements with emphasis on the hot spot observations and the angular range of dominant influence of each parameter The retrieved parameters translate optical and structural properties of the canopy. They are used to calculate a new architectural parameter X that allows to get the clumping index of the patch vegetation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Changes in composition of plant species are expected to accompany a warming climate. In the northern mixed grass prairie, such changes are predicted to take the form of shifts in the relative ground cover of C3 and C4 photosynthetic types. In this study, we explore the feasibility of using two-date remote sensing data as a potential tool for monitoring these shifts. Our approach is based on the well-described asynchronous seasonality of C3 and C4 species. We hypothesize that the ratios of early-season to late-season aboveground live biomass (B-early/B-late) will decrease as sites become more C4-dominated, and that if B-early and B-late can be reliably estimated using spectral data, it may be feasible to predict C4 species coverage (%C4) from commercially available satellite information. Using spectral and botanical measurements from three upland communities in the Canadian mixed grass prairie, we (a) examined the relationship between various spectral vegetation indices and aboveground live biomass, (b) investigated the nature of the relationship between remotely sensed estimated of B-early/B-late and %C4 at multiple sample resolutions (0.5 m, 2.5 m, 10 m and 50 m), and (c) assessed whether these relationships were dependent on the vegetation index used to estimate biomass. We found a log-linear relationship between each spectral index and aboveground live biomass. Negative linear relationships were found between %C4 and remotely sensed B-early/B-late at all sampling resolutions. These relationships were strongest at sampling resolutions of 10 m and 50 m. The strengths and forms of relationships were found to be partially vegetation index-dependent. Stronger relationships between variants at coarser resolutions likely result from the smoothing of fine-scale variation in aboveground live biomass and C4 species coverage. Our results suggest that commercially available satellite data at resolutions of 10 m to 50 m (e.g., Landsat Thematic Mapper) may offer the potential for estimating coverage of C4 species and that the choice of vegetation index used to estimate biomass is relatively unimportant. However, we caution that for this technique to be operationally useful, statistical model performance must be strengthened and developed to provide both temporal and spatial generality. Further investigation is needed to examine the applicability of this approach to other growing seasons, community types, and grassland regions. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.

AB Results from a series of laboratory measurements of spectral reflectance and transmittance of individual leaves and from a modeling study are presented which demonstrate that effects of natural chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) are observable in the red edge spectral region. Measurements have been made with a Li-Cor Model 1800 integrating sphere apparatus coupled to an Ocean Optics Model ST1000 fiber spectrometer in which the same leaves are illuminated alternately with and without fluorescence-exciting radiation in order to separate the fluorescence emission component from the reflectance spectrum. The resulting difference spectrum is shown experimentally to be consistent with a fluorescence signature imposed on the inherent leaf reflectance signature. A study of the diurnal change in leaf reflectance spectra, combined with fluorescence measurements with the PAM-20000 Fluorometer, show that the difference spectra are consistent with observed diurnal changes in steady-state fluorescence. In addition, the time decay in the difference signature from repetitive leaf spectral reflectance measurements is seen to be consistent with the time decay of the leaf fluorescence signal (Kautsky effect) of dark-adapted leaves. The expected effects of chlorophyll fluorescence emission on the apparent spectral reflectance from a single leaf are also simulated theoretically using the doubling radiative transfer method. These modeling results demonstrate that the laboratory observations of a difference spectrum with broad peak at about 750 nm and a much smaller peak near 690 nm are in agreement with theory. Model simulation shows that chlorophyll pigment and fluorescence each affect indices that are being used in optical remote sensing to characterize pigment levels and stress in vegetation canopies. Implications for high spectral resolution remote sensing of forest canopies are presented in a companion paper. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The Jornada Experimental Range (Jornada) in southern New Mexico provides a unique opportunity to use remote sensing techniques to study arid rangeland and the responses of vegetation to changing hydrologic fluxes and atmospheric driving forces. Research by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service and Agricultural Research Service at Jornada has been continuous since 1912. The Jornada has been a National Science Foundation Long-Term Ecological Research site since 1981. These long-term investigations have provided ground data on vegetation characteristics, ecosystem dynamics, and vegetation response to changing physical and biological conditions. To complement the programs of ground measurements, a campaign called JORNEX (JORNada EXperiment) began in 1995 to collect remotely sensed data from aircraft and satellite platforms to provide spatial and temporal data on physical: and biological states of the Jornada rangeland. A wide range of ground, aircraft, and satellite data have been collected on the physical, vegetative, thermal, and radiometric properties of three ecosystems (grass, grass/shrub transition, and shrub) typical of the Jornada rangeland and of southwestern U.S, deserts. Spatial surface energy balance estimates were made from a combination of parameters and state variables estimated from aircraft and ground data. Landscape surface roughness was evaluated with the laser altimetry data and used to estimate aerodynamic roughness. Data from different platforms allowed the evaluation of the landscape at different scales. These measurements are being used to quantity hydrologic budgets and plant responses to change in components in the water and energy balance at the Jornada. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Scanning lidar remote sensing systems have recently become available for use in ecological applications. Unlike conventional microwave and optical sensors, lidar sensors directly measure the distribution of vegetation material along the vertical axis and can be used to provide three-dimensional, or volumetric, characterizations of vegetation structure. Ecological applications of scanning lidar have hitherto used one-dimensional indices to characterize canopy height. A novel three-dimensional analysis of lidar waveforms was developed to characterize the total volume and spatial organization of vegetation material and empty space within the forest canopy. These aspects of the physical structure of canopies have been infrequently measured, from either field or remote methods. We applied this analysis to 22 plots in Douglas-fir/western hemlock stands on the west slope of the Cascades Range in Oregon. Each plot had coincident lidar data and field measurements of stand structure. We compared results from the novel analysis to two earlier methods of canopy description. Using the indices of canopy structure from all three methods of description as independent variables in a stepwise multiple regression, we were able to make nonasymptotic predictions of biomass and leaf area index (LAI) over a wide range, up to 1200 Mg ha(-1) of biomass and art LAI of 12, with 90% and 75% of variance explained respectively. Furthermore, we were able to make accurate estimates of other stand structure attributes, including the mean and standard deviation of diameter at breast height, the number of steins greater than 100 cm in diameter and independent estimates of the basal area of Douglas-fir and western hemlock. These measurements can be directly related to indices of forest stand structural complexity, such as those developed for old-growth forest characterisation. Indices of canopy structure developed using the novel, three-dimensional analysis accounted for most of the variables used in predictive equations generated by the stepwise multiple regression.

AB While most forest maps identify only the dominant vegetation class in delineated stands, individual stands are often better characterized by a mix of vegetation types. Many land management applications, including wildlife habitat studies, can benefit from knowledge of mixes. This article examines various algorithms that use data from the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite to estimate mixtures of vegetation types within forest stands. Included in the study are maximum likelihood classification and linear mixture models as well as a new methodology based on the ARTMAP neural network. Two paradigms are considered: classification methods, which describe stand-level vegetation mixtures as mosaics of pixels, each identified with its primary vegetation class; and mixture methods, which treat samples as blends of vegetation, even at the pixel level. Comparative analysis of these mixture estimation methods, tested on data from the Plumas National Forest, yields the following conclusions: 1) Accurate estimates of proportions of hardwood and conifer cover within stands can be obtained, particularly when brush is not present in the understory; 2) ARTMAP outperforms statistical methods and linear mixture models in both the classification and the mixture paradigms; 3) topographic correction fails to improve mapping accuracy; and 4) the new ARTMAP mixture system produces the most accurate overall results. The Plumas data set has been made available to other researchers for further development of new mapping methods and comparison with the quantitative studies presented here, which establish initial benchmark standards.

Normalized band depths calculated from the continuum-removed reflectance spectra of dried and ground leaves were used to estimate their concentrations of nitrogen, lignin, and cellulose. Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to select wavelengths in the broad absorption features cen tered at 1.73 mu m, 2.10 mu m, and 2.30 mu m that were highly correlated with the chemistry of samples from eastern U.S. forests. Band depths of absorption features at these wavelengths were found to also be highly correlated with the chemistry of four other sites. A subset of data from the eastern U.S, forest sites was used to derive linear equations that rc;ere applied to the remaining data to successfully estimate their nitrogen, lignin, and cellulose concentrations. Correlations were highest for nitrogen (R-2 from 0.75 to 0.94). The consistent results indicate the possibility of establishing a single equation capable of estimating the chemical concentrations in a wide variety of species front the reflectance spectra of dried leaves. The extension of this method to remote sensing was investigated. The effects of leaf water content, sensor signal-to-noise and bandpass, atmospheric effects, and background soil exposure were examined. Leaf water was found to be the greatest challenge to extending this empirical method to the analysis of fresh whole leaves and complete vegetation canopies. The influence of leaf water on reflectance spectra must be removed to within 10%. Other effects were reduced by continuum removal and normalization of band depths. If the effects of leaf water can be compensated for, it might be possible to extend this method to remote sensing data acquired by imaging spectrometers to give estimates of nitrogen, lignin, and cellulose concentrations over large areas for use in ecosystem studies.

AB In this study we attempted to monitor two main key stages in the phenological cycle of deciduous forests-budburst and senescence-using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived front NOAA/AVHRR. These stages induce rapid (time scale of ct month), large (>0.3) and nearly linear NDVI variations. The method we developed consists of a fit of NDVI predicted by line segment to AVHRR-NDVI time series. It made it possible to derive the budburst and senescence timing, and then the phenological cycle duration. A relationship found in the literature between leaf area index (LAI) and NDVI showed that LAI was about 1 for the satellite-derived budburst and about 1.5 for the satellite-derived senescence. We tested the method on three nearly monospecific (Quercus petraea and Fagus sylvatica L.) forests located in France using a 6-year NOAA/AVHRR archive during the 1989-1994 period. The satellite-derived phenology revealed differences in relational to the composition and the climatic features of the study areas: 1) the phenological cycle duration of oak was longer (34 days) for southern than for northern forests, 2) in the North of France, beech trees were buckling earlier (5.6 days) than oak trees, 3) the interannual variability of budburst was significantly lower for beech than for oak trees. The comparison with ground phenological observations found in the literature showed the spatio-temporal coherence of the satellite-derived phenology A good correlation was also found between the satellite-derived budburst and the budburst timing predicted from air temperatures using the thermal time model. These tests provided a first validation of the method we developed to monitor the phenological cycle of deciduous forests with NOAA/AVHHR data. The limitations of the method and the perspectives for modeling temperature deciduous ecosystems are finally discussed. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB The response of polarimetric airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to grassland is investigated. Synthetic aperture radar from the National Aeronautical and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA/JPL) airborne imaging system was acquired over a diverse grassland site in northern NSW, Australia in September 1993. Grassland and high backscatter targets are classified using images from C, L, and P band for hh, hv, and vv polarizations. The grassland classes cover a wide dynamic range of backscatter from -7 dB to -14 dB in C band and -9 dB to -23 dB in L band. Significant regression relationships are formulated between measurements of grassland height and radar backscatter using site data aggregated by 25 mm height class. The relationship between species composition and grassland classes is explored. Polarization effects include an enhanced range of backscatter across grassland classes for 45 degrees cross polarization at L band and differences in the pedestal height of the C band polarization signature for species classes. The results of drainage modeling suggest that soil moisture is a significant confounding factor influencing radar backscatter from the grassland. Simple models using logistic probability of association between height class and radar backscatter in a Bayesian inference engine, and a simple threhold based on logistic probability of association between wet areas and P-vv are examined. Our results suggest that combined imagery from C and L band satellite-borne SAR sensors have potential for current application in grassland monitoring. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
AB This article describes an airborne digital video imaging system (ADVIS) and presents multispectral imagery to illustrate its potential use as a remote sensing research tool. The system was primarily designed to acquire multiband images for ascertaining spectral bands and/or band combinations to better characterize and assess natural resources. The ADVIS is comprised of 12 charge coupled device (CCD) analog video cameras and a computer equipped with a single multichannel digitizing board. The system cameras are equipped with various narrowband (6.5-12.6 nm bandwidths) interference filters to acquire images within the visible/near-infrared (NIR) (400-1000 nm) spectral waveband. The ADVIS multichannel capturing board is capable of obtaining 12 analog video inputs that are readily converted into digital images having 640 by 480 pixels resolution. The digitizing board has four RGB bunks which have the capability of generating four synchronized real-time false color composite images from any selectable three-band combination among the 12 cameras, as keyed by the RGB inputs of the digitizing board. The computer system has a two GB storage capacity hard dl-iue that can store 2000 RGB 24-bit color images. The system is unique because the quad real-time color composite imagery It provides is of adequate quality for assessing scenes of interest and there is no need for post-processing band registration immediately after the flight mission in order to evaluate the imagery. Also, the display of the quad images readily depicts which composite image(s) provides better differences among land-use cover types in the scene. This imagery, however, needs to be registered for image processing and analysis. The display of the black-and-white (B&W) image components (spectral bands) of the composite images provide basic information to assist in the interpretation of the color composites and to qualitatively understand the interaction of ecological parameters with the electromagnetic spectrum. The ADVIS multispectral image acquisition may determine the best band(s) for characterizing and/or detecting problems of the various natural resources. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB During the two SIR-C/X-SAR missions in 1994, surface film experiments were performed in the North Sea with a 5-frequency/multipolarization scatterometer flown on a helicopter, in order to investigate the reduction of the radar backscatter in the presence of quasibiogenic and anthropogenic sea surface films, particularly, at different wind speeds. Under all wind conditions encountered in this study, the measured damping ratio (i.e., the ratio of the radar backscatter from a slick-free and a slick-covered water surface) increases with increasing Bragg wavenumber. It is shown that not only Marangoni damping theory, but also wind-induced effects, primarily the energy input by the wind into the wave spectrum, also have to be taken ito account. The reductions measured at low to moderate wind speeds (3.5-4 m/s and 5 m/s) are qualitatively explained by means of a comparison of the different source terms of the action balance equation. For the case of high wind speed (12 m/s) a theoretical model for the damping ratios is developed. Using this model, the experimental data can well be reproduced, and the absence of the Marangoni damping maximum at intermediate Bragg wavenumbers (approximately 100 rad/m) can be interpreted. Furthermore, the model can explain the similarities between the radar backscatter reductions measured over quasibiogenic and anthropogenic surface films under high wind conditions.

AB Canopy reflectance measurements of semileafless pea and faba bean crops grown under irrigated and rain-fed conditions were taken with a field spectroradiometer. These legume crops have different canopy architectures. These legume crops have different canopy architectures. During crop growth nine vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated from reflectance measurements taken in TM2, TM3, TM4, and TM5 bands. Five VIs were ratio indices, (RVI, NDVI, SAVI2, TSAVI, and RDVI), two were orthogonal indices (PVI and GVI3), and the other two (STVI and CRVI) included the mid-infrared band. The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) from a ceptometer and reflectance were measured simultaneously. Linear, exponential, and power relationships between VI and fAPAR were constructed to evaluate the capability of each VI to estimate fAPAR in these crops. The influence of solar angle on VI determination was also studied, using reflectance measurements at several hours during the day at two different crop growth stages. Results show that, in both species, different relationships are needed for pre-and postmaximum leaf area index (LAImax) phases of development. In preLAImax of both species, all VI correlated highly with fAPAR, but the coefficients of determination (R-2) for ratio indices were generally higher than orthogonal indices (PVI and GVI3) and indices with the TM5 band (STVI and CRVI). Among ratio indices, in pre-LAImax, R-2 did not differ significantly between those that included the soil effect (SAVI2 and TSAVI) and those that did not (RVI, NDVI, and RDVI). Relationships with indices that include the TM5 band (STVI and CRVI) showed a great slope, increasing the sensitivity of the estimates of fAPAR to errors and frequency of the reflectance measurements. During pre-LAImax phase, curvilinear relationships are better for pea canopies, while linear ones were found more appropriate for faba beans. In post-LAImax, linear relations were in general better, especially in peas. Relationships did not differ between irrigated and rainfed treatments within crops, even in early stages of growth with poor soil cover, so that only one was proposed for each species. All VI values were greatly affected by the hour of measurement at solar angles greater than 45 degrees. The indices most affected by solar angle changes were STVI and CRVI. We can conclude that simple indices, RVI and NDVI, based on reflectance measurements in TM3 and TM4 bands can be used to accurately asses canopy development in faba bean and semileafless peas, allowing good and fast estimations of fAPAR and LAI, both important parameters in crop physiology and modeling. More research in different type of soils is needed to check if ratio, SAVI2 and TSAVI, or orthogonal, PVI and GVI3, indices that include the effect of soils can improve the estimation of fAPAR in these two crops.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID LEAVES
AB This article examines how different processing, in particular different degrees of smoothing, affect the extraction of biophysical information from high spectral resolution data. Spectral reflectance data collected during the EISAC'89 Campaign from and experimental grassland site on Tadham Moor, Somerset, United Kingdom were used for the analysis, together with canopy biomass, chlorophyll, and water content variables. The analysis focuses mainly on the correlation between percentage water content per unit area of canopy and spectral parameters across the two water absorption features, around 940 nm and 1150 nm. Correlation analysis revealed that both the strength of the peak correlation between the first derivative of reflectance and water content and its wavelength position were sensitive to the degree of smoothing for the 1150 nm feature, although this was not the case for the 940 nm water absorption feature. This sensitivity is attributed to the fact that different levels of smoothing emphasize different spectral features across a wavelength region where the first derivative of reflectance and the biophysical variable are generally highly correlated. The effect emphasizes that the exact position of peak correlation between these two variables should be interpreted with caution, especially across spectral regions where the correlation is generally high. A simple reflectance ratio based on the relative depth of the water absorption feature was found to be more closely related to canopy water content and insensitive to the degree of spectral smoothing.

ID LAND-USE; HABITAT; ERROR
AB Landscape- and ecoregion-based conservation efforts increasingly use a spatial component to organize data for analysis and interpretation. A challenge particular to remotely sensed cover maps generated from these efforts is how best to assess the accuracy of the cover maps, especially when they can exceed 1000 s/km(2) in size. Here we develop and describe a methodological approach for assessing the accuracy of large-area cover maps, using as a test case the 21.9 million ha cover map developed for Utah Gap Analysis. As part of our design process, we first reviewed the effect of intracluster correlation and a simple cost function on the relative efficiency of cluster sample designs to simple random designs. Our design ultimately combined clustered and subsampled field data stratified by ecological modeling unit and accessibility (hereafter a mixed design). We next outline estimation formulas for simple map accuracy measures under our mixed design and report results for eight major cover types and the three ecoregions mapped as part of the Utah Gap Analysis. Overall accuracy of the map was 83.2% (SE=1.4). Within ecoregions, accuracy ranged from 78.9% to 85.0%. Accuracy by cover type varied, ranging from a low of 50.4% for barren to a high of 90.6% for man modified. In addition, we examined gains in efficiency of our mixed design compared with a simple random sample approach. In regard to precision, our mixed design was more precise than a simple random design, given fixed sample costs. We close with a discussion of the logistical constraints facing attempts to assess the accuracy of large-area, remotely sensed cover maps.

AB This paper discusses a methodology for computing the clear-sky surface albedo over the Greenland ice sheet by using advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) global area coverage visible and near-infrared reflectances. This approach is then used to map the monthly changes in albedo over the entire Greenland ice sheet during the spring and summer months. The methodology includes corrections for the intervening atmosphere by using the 6S radiative transfer model. Additional corrections for the anisotropic nature of snow reflectance and the conversion from a narrow- into a broadband albedo are made based on in situ measurements from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology University of Colorado camp at 69-degrees-34'N, 49-degrees-18'W. Comparison with surface albedo field measurements indicates that before the onset of snow melt, agreement is good between the satellite-derived and measured surface albedo. After melt begins, it is difficult to compare the satellite values with the field data owing to melt water ponding on the ice sheet surface. With appropriate modifications, the 6S radiative transfer model is suitable for atmospherically correcting AVHRR visible and near-infrared radiances in polar regions.

AB During the 1994 Arctic Ocean Section, a joint voyage across the Arctic Ocean, by the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Polar Sea and the Canadian Coast Guard Ship Louis S. St.-Laurent, telemetry from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) polar orbiters was tracked by a shipboard antenna. Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) data was used to generate maps of total sea. ice concentration, using the NASA Team algorithm with the 19 GHz and 37 GHz channels, and using a polarization-based algorithm with the 85.5 GHz channels. When compared with shipboard ice observations, the total sea ice concentration estimated from the 85.5 GHz algorithm are at least as accurate as those from the algorithm that uses only the lower SSM/I frequencies, despite the potential for greater difficulty in dealing with cloud liquid water contamination in the 85.5 GHz signal during the Arctic summer. Near the edge of the ice pack, the 85.5 GHz algorithm often provided more accurate estimates of total ice concentration when compared with surface observations, most likely because of the finer grid spacing at 85.5 GHz (12.5 km vs. 25 km for 37 GHz). However, when using the 85.5 GHz algorithm over regions of lower ice concentration, the reference polarizations in a given image must be chosen with care because over lower sea ice concentration the polarization-based algorithm is more sensitive to cloud opacity and can easily and substantially underestimate the ice concentration. The 85.5 GHz total sea ice retrievals are compared with in situ snow wetness measurements. This comparison suggests that, despite the higher atmospheric opacity at 85.5 GHz, information about sea ice surface properties that affect emissivity can be obtained from these SSM/I channels.

AB All integrated remote sensing/field ecology project linked the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and aerial photography to studies of landscape spatial heterogeneity and bird community ecology. P-, L-, and C-band SAR data, collected over a section of Kakadu National Park in Australia's Northern Territory during the Joint NASA/Australia DC-8 data acquisition campaign, were analyzed in light of field data integrating vegetation structure and floristics with bird abundances across a heterogeneous study site. Results indicate that SAR data are able to discern structural differences relevant to bird habitat quality within floristically homogeneous stands, while multispectral sensors successfully identified floristic differences among habitat types. Simplifying indices of bird diversity showed ambiguous changes across the site; however, the abundances of individual species were observed to change significantly across both floristic and structural gradients. These results suggest that efforts to map bird diversity should focus on species-specific habitat relationships and that some measure of vegetation structure is needed to understand bird habitat. The approach employed here advances the use of SAR data in the three-dimensional mapping of animal habitats from remotely sensed data, and extends current capabilities for mapping and modeling large-scale patterns in the distribution of biological diversity.

AB Bir Safsaf, within the hyperarid ''core'' of the Sahara in the Western Desert of Egypt, was recognized following the SIR-A and SIR-B missions in the 1980s as one of the key localities in northeast Africa, where penetration of dry sand by radar signals delineates previously unknown, sand-buried paleodrainage valleys (''radar-rivers'') of middle Tertiary to Quaternary age. The Bir Safsaf area was targeted as a focal point for further research in sand penetration and geologic mapping using the multifrequency and polarimetric SIR-C/X-SAR sensors. Analysis of the SIR-C/X-SAR data from Bir Safsaf provides important new information on the roles of multiple SAR frequency and polarimetry in portraying specific types of geologic units, materials, and structures mostly hidden from view on the ground and on Landsat TM images by a relatively thin, but extensive blanket of blow sand. Basement rock units (granitoids and gneisses) and the fractures associated with them at Bir Safsaf are shown here for the first time to be clearly delineated using C- and L-band SAR images. The detectability of most geologic features is dependent primarily on radar frequency, as shown for wind erosion patterns in bedrock at X-band (3 cm wavelength), and for geologic units and sand and clay-filled fractures in weathered crystalline basement rocks at C-band (6 m) and L-band (24 cm). By contrast, Quaternary paleodrainage channels are detectable at all three radar frequencies owing, among other things, to an usually thin cover of blow sand. The SIR-C/X-SAR data investigated to date enable us to make specific recommendations about the utility of certain radar sensor configurations for geologic and paleoenvironmental reconnaissance in desert regions.

ID MICROWAVE BACKSCATTER DEPENDENCE; SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; BARE SOIL
AB SIR-C L-band measurements over the Little Washita River watershed in Chickasha, Oklahoma during 11-17 April 1994 have been analyzed for studying the change of soil moisture in the region. Two algorithms developed recently for estimation of moisture content in bare soil were applied to these measurements and the results were compared with those sampled on the ground. There is a good agreement between the values of soil moisture estimated by either one of the algorithms and those measured from ground sampling for bare or sparsely vegetated fields. The standard error from this comparison is on the order of 0.05-0.06 cm(3)/cm(3), which is comparable to that expected from a regression between backscattering coefficients and measured soil moisture. Both algorithms provide a poor estimation of soil moisture or fail to give solutions to areas covered with moderate or fail to give solutions to areas covered with moderate or dense vegetation. Even for bare soils the number of pixels that bear no numerical solution from the application of either one of the two algorithms to the data is not negligible. Results from using one of these algorithms indicate that the fraction of these pixels becomes larger as the bare soils become drier. The other algorithm generally gives a larger fraction of these pixels when the fields are vegetation-covered. The implication and impact of these features are discussed in this article.

AB One year of NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) global area coverage (GAC) infrared satellite data from September 1992 to August 1993 were processed into 10-day composite sea surface temperature (SST) maps, which show the variability of SST in the Western Tropical Pacific Ocean (including the TOGA COARE area). In situ SST measurements from moored buoy data were used to validate the satellite SST products revealing the multichannel SST (MCSST) to be most representative of the buoy SSTs. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was performed to characterize the principal components of the annual SST variability. The first EOF mode (64.2% of the variance) indicates that the variance of the satellite derived MCSST has a strong meridional structure with a marked seasonal modulation. This first mode suggests the importance of ''warm pool'' with a maximum just south of the equator at about 170 degrees E. The second mode (8.7% of the variance) and the rest of the EOF modes show more complex spatial structures. The large amount of variance explained by the first mode compared to the second mode indicates that the seasonal variance of the warm pool dominates all other variability. This strong seasonal behavior is also clearly seen in the monthly meridional position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The annual mean SST map shows a persistent warm pool from 13 degrees S to 10 degrees N and 130 degrees E to 170 degrees W, which is larger than the COARE intensive observing period (IOP) domain. Monthly SST means in the region suggest a seasonal cycle in phase with the solar cycle. Warm pool total area variance and its centroid movement demonstrate similar annual cycles.

ID VEGETATION CANOPIES; LEAF-ORIENTATION
AB Fluorescence or backscattered signals measured over a plant canopy after a picosecond laser shot (nadir viewing) are composed of elementary contributions coming from different illuminated leaves, branches, twigs, and the soil background. They are affected by time delays, depending on their levels within the canopy. The global signals measured are then rather complex and depend on canopy architecture and fluorescence characteristics Also, an amplitude decorrelation exists between fluorescence and backscattered signals, due to the difference existing between reflectance and fluorescence properties of plant canopy components. For this reason it was necessary to develop a specific method for retrieving the mean fluorescence lifetime of a complex plant canopy under field condition. In a first step, the position and the reflectance characteristics of each reflecting canopy element is determined from the deconvolution of the backscattered signal. In a second step, the parameters obtained are introduced into the fluorescence function in order to determine the mean fluorescence lifetime. The validity of the deconvolution method has been tested for numerous situations, using simulated laser shots on a 3-D canopy mockup. The results obtained show a very good agreement between estimated and input parameters. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID WHEAT CANOPIES; VEGETATION; SCATTERING
AB A new method is suggested for classifying the geometry of canopies from red and near-infrared reflectance values measured from a nadir view. The method relies on the fact that the slope of a very strong linear statistical relationship (R(2) > 0.95) between two indices varies significantly with the structure of the canopy. The first index (RVI(c)) is the ratio between reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) and in the red channels, where intercept (b) of the soil line is substracted from the NIR: RVI(c) = (NIR - b)/Red. The second index (GEO) is a new index calculated from the indices (PVI and SLI) introduced by Richardson and Wiegand (1977; Wiegand and Richardson, 1982): GEO = (SLI(2) + PVI2)/(SLI - PVI). GEO is much more sensitive to canopy architecture than is RVI(c). Thus the ratio of RVI(c), vs GEO, or the slope in such graphs, increases as leaf angle increases. Applied to three wheat cultivars, the smallest slope of the RVI(c) vs. GEO is for the cultivar that differed from the others by a mean leaf angle of about 15 degrees or less. The significance of the approach is that it helps identify leaf angle differences among observed canopies when leaf area index (LAI) is unknown but has a sufficient space variability. This method is illustrated by the RVI(c)-GEO relations within a durum wheat field in the south of France observed on two SPOT satellite scenes. An Increase of leaf erectness between tillering stage and early grain filling phase (2 weeks after anthesis) is clearly shown by the evolution of the slope of the RVI(c) vs. GEO relation.

AB A continuous He-Nc laser with an acousto-optical modulator as a high-speed optical shutter generates a pulse with a length of 2 msec and a maximum power density of 600 W/m(2). According to the chlorophyll fluorescence-induction kinetics, the fluorescence intensity of plants reaches its initial value (F-o) and continues to rise during the excitation pulse. This increase can be described by an exponential function and a linear term, which depend on the power density at the laser spot, on the grade of inhibition of photosynthetic activity by herbicides or environmental stress, and on the duration of the dark adaptation time. A single measurement with the msec pulse method requires only a short time because the period of dark adaptation, necessary for the induction kinetics, can be reduced to several 100 msec. A modification of the device allows measurements at distances between 0.5 m and 3 m.

A helicopter-borne laser was tested in a coastal Scots pine stand where mean height was approximately 12.5 m. The laser equipment operated in a scanning mode and different laser footprints and sampling densities were tested at three independent registration times: one in June, one in October, and one in December. The tested footprints, measured at the ground, were between 0.75 m and 3.0 m in diameter. The results showed that the mean tree height was underestimated by 2.1-3.7 m. Optimal laser footprint size was found to change across data acquisition times.

AB Vegetation Indices, including the simple ratio (SR) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), from Landsat TM data were correlated to ground-based measurements of LAI, effective LAI, and the crown closure in boreal conifer forests located near Candle Lake and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan and near Thompson, Manitoba, as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). The measurements were made using two optical instruments: the Plant Canopy Analyzer (LAI-2000, LI-COR) and the TRAC (Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies). The TRAC was recently developed to quantify the effect of canopy architecture on optical measurements of leaf area index. The stands were located on georeferenced Landsat TM images using global positioning system (GPS) measurements. It is found that late spring Landsat images are superior to summer images for determining overstory LAI in boreal conifer stands because the effect of the understory is minimized in the spring before the full growth of the understory and moss cover. The effective LAI, obtained from gap fraction measurements assuming a random distribution of foliage spatial positions, was found to be better correlated to SR and NDVI than LAI. The effective LAI is less variable and easier to measure than LAI, and is also an intrinsic attribute of plant canopies. It is therefore suggested to use effective LAI as the most important parameter for radiation interception considerations.

AB The accurate segmentation of sea ice from cloud and from cloud-free ocean in. polar AVHRR imagery is important for many scientific applications (e.g., sea ice-albedo feedback mechanisms, heat exchange between ocean and atmosphere in polar regions; studies of the stability of surface water in polar regions). Unfortunately, it is a difficult task complicated by the common visible reflectance characteristics of sea ice and cloud, Moreouer, AVHRR Channel 3 data historically have been contaminated by highly variable sensor noise which generally has hampered their use in the classification of polar scenes. Likewise, polar scenes often contain pixels with mixed classes (e.g., sea ice and cloud). This article uses a combination of fuzzy logic classification methods, noise reduction in AVHRR Channel 3 data using Wiener filtering methods (Simpson and Yhann, 1994), and a physically motivated rule base which makes effective use of the Wiener filtered Channel 3 data to more accurately segment polar imagery. The new method's improved classification skill compared to more traditional methods, as well as its regional independence, is demonstrated. The algorithm is computationally efficient and hence is suitable for analyzing the large volumes of polar imagery needed in many global change studies.

AB The state-of-the-art on radiative transfer modeling in vegetation canopies and the application of such models to the interpretation and analysis of remotely sensed optical data is summarized. Modeling of top-of-the-atmosphere and top-of-the-canopy radiance field is developed as boundary value problems in radiative transfer. The parameterization of the constituent functions with simple models and/or empirical data is outlined together with numerical solution methods and examples of results of model validation. Caveats in the assignment of signal characteristics to surface properties are itemized and discussed with example results. Algorithms to estimate surface properties from remote observations are classified as spectral vegetation indices, model inversion, expert systems, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. Their applicability is also discussed.

AB Cloud cover is one of several constraints on the ability of VIS/NIR sensors, such as those on board Landsat, to provide a continuing time series of data for glaciological studies in polar regions; for example, the long term observation of annual mass balance fluctuations or the shortterm monitoring of surging glaciers. In order to ascertain the extent to which cloudiness prevents Landsat imagery from providing such datasets in the European Arctic, cloud cover data for all imagery acquired during April-September, 1983-92, for 15 glaciologically significant areas (each represented by a Landsat path/row) were examined. Cloudiness values were derived from the Eurimage LEDA (onLine Earthnet Data Availability) catalogue. The results indicate that regions of the European Arctic may be classified into three groups on the basis of the frequency of availability of high quality imagery (<35% cloud cover). Marked seasonal differences are also evident between the groups. Comparable findings from previous cloud cover studies using ground station data illustrate that the scenes used in this study are representative of the regions in which they lie. The relative abilities of Landsat MSS/TM and ERS-1 SAR data to provide multitemporal datasets are compared; although SAR is unaffected by cloud, ERS-1 has a longer revisit interval (multidisciplinary phase) than Landsat. Only in East Greenland has Landsat generated a sufficient number of high quality scenes to provide a useful multitemporal dataset. Elsewhere in the European Arctic the prevalence of the cloud cover is such that it may prevent the effective use of VIS/NIR data for certain glaciological studies. If the required information can be derived from radar data, the utilization of SAR should prove advantageous for obtaining future multitemporal datasets in these regions of the European Arctic sector.

AB Nadir-viewed reflectances from forest canopies in four spectral bands, centered at 485 nm, 654 nm, 841 nm, and 1676 nm were measured at different sun angles. Reflectances were measured made from a helicopter ca. 10 km NE of Stockholm, Sweden, over mature and young stands of Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). The results show a significant increase in nadir reflectance with decreasing solar zenith angle. On the average, reflectance factors increased by 1-2% for each degree of decreasing solar zenith angle. Band ratios showed that there is a disproportional reflectance response in several of the spectral bands at varying zenith angles, differently expressed according to stand type and age. Within the solar zenith angle interval 30-70-degrees, canopy reflectance was expressed as linear functions for each spectral band. These functions were used to calculate factors for reflectance standardization. Nomograms, containing reflectance correction factors for mature spruce stands, are presented. These can be directly applied in time-series analysis of multitemporal spectral data.

AB The actual evapotranspiration from one test site in the northern part of Senegal was calculated using a combination of NOAA-AVHRR data and meteorological data. AVHRR data were calibrated and corrected for the influence of the atmosphere. The relationship ET - RN = ab(T(s) - T(a)) was established on the basis of in situ measurements of fluxes during a field campaign September-October 1988. The flux measurements are presented, and the influence of surface roughness on the relationship is analyzed. A simple method for time integration of actual evapotranspiration between days with satellite data is presented.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID RETRIEVAL; IMAGES; SENSOR
AB Different types of regression functions for multitemporal relative calibration of Landsat TM data were compared. The aim was to evaluate suitable function types for a proposed change detection technique. In this technique, multitemporal relatively calibrated satellite data are compared within spectrally homogeneous forest stands. In boreal forests, only minor parts of a large forest area are likely to substantially change within a few years. Thus, for change detection in forest stands, the forest land itself might be used as spectral reference for statistical image normalization techniques. The regression functions were used to predict the pixel values for the TM data at a recent acquisition from TM data obtained during an earlier acquisition. All functions were validated with a set of pixel values for forest without changes. No large error reductions were obtained with the use of ancillary forest data. Regression functions computed from only forest pixels gave higher coefficients of determination than functions computed from all image pixels or from dark and bright areas only. The relationship between spectral data from different years was approximately linear. Robust regression performed better than the least squares method when outliers were present. Also an iterated histogram matching was found to give an accuracy similar to that of band-to-band robust regression. Regression methods are sensitive to geometrical errors between spatially registered imagery, but histogram matching is not. Multiple regression functions from all TM bands were considerably better than the band-to-band regressions, especially for Bands TM 1-3. Thus when the geometric errors are small, multiple regression may be used instead of histogram matching. The good performance of the multiple regression also suggests that this method could be used even for change detection between imagery from different sensors.

AB A simple bidirectional reflectance model suitable for homogeneous plant canopies is developed. The model was applied to simulate directional changes of spectral reflectances from a tallgrass canopy and compared with field measurements by Deering and Middleton (1990). A modified two-stream approach was used in the model by considering the transfers of upward reflected and diffuse radiation in different viewing directions, downward direct and diffuse radiation, and their dependences upon canopy leaf orientation. An analytical solution was derived to allow a fast computation of directional reflectances based on canopy parameters or a retrieval of canopy parameters based on reflectance measurements. Modeled spectral reflectances are generally in a good agreement with measurements, and effects of inhomogeneous canopy characteristics such as ''hot spot'' and of soil reflection were examined. Both modeled and observed reflectances show strong backscattering and relatively weak forward scattering in the red band, but a more symmetric distribution in the near-infrared band. The directional changes of reflectance in both red and near-infrared bands are dominated by primary scattering the magnitudes of reflectance in the near-infrared band are largely influenced by secondary scattering. Model simulations for three theoretical leaf angle distributions (planophile, spherical, and erectophile) show that hemispherical reflectance or albedo could be overestimated by nadir reflectance at a small solar zenith angle and underestimated at a large solar zenith angle. The error, however, can be reduced to a minimum at an optimal solar zenith angle which has the same magnitude for the three leaf angle distributions but decreases with increasing canopy leaf area index. Modeled vegetation spectral index, NDVI, appears to vary by 10-24% with viewing angle for a given leaf angle distribution and canopy leaf area index, and it generally has a larger value for forward scattering than for backscattering.

AB Light interception and reflection in different cultivars of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare) were measured in a field experiment and used to verify a theoretical relation between the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (f(PAR)) and the relative vegetation index (RVI). The RVI was calculated as the ratio between infrared (790810 nm) and red (640-660 nm) reflectance. The cultivars form a different canopy structure. However, a regression analysis did not show any cultivar effect on the relation between RVI and f(PAR). The predicted f(PAR) from frequently measured RVI was used to calculate the product of daily f(PAR) and incoming PAR (cumulative PAR interception) in all spring barley cultivars grown in monoculture and in mixture with oil seed rape (Brassica napus). A regression analysis showed that the relation between cumulative intercepted PAR and total above ground biomass was the same in all monocultures and mixtures. The ratio a of incremental dry matter and intercepted PAR was normally 2.4 g MJ-1, but it declined below this value when temperatures fell below 12-degrees-C.

AB Remotely sensed infrared radiance emitted by a surface is a function both of its kinetic temperature and its spectral emissivity. Consequently, assumptions are usually made about the emissivity of earth surface materials to allow their temperatures to be determined, or vice versa. To increase the accuracy of these assumptions, the directional hemispherical spectral reflectance of a wide range of natural earth surface materials has been measured and is summarized here. These include igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, desert varnish, soils, vegetation, water, and ice. Kirchhoff's Law can be used to predict directional spectral emissivity from these data.

AB Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne virus that affects livestock and humans in Africa. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data are shown to be effective in identifying dambos, intermittently flooded areas that are potential mosquito breeding sites, in an area north of Nairobi, Kenya. Positive results were obtained from a limited test of flood detection in dambos with airborne high resolution L, C, and X band multipolarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. L and C bands were effective in detecting flooded dambos, but LHH was by far the best channel for discrimination (p < 0.01) between flooded and nonflooded sites in both sedge and short grass environments. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a combined passive and active remote sensing program for monitoring the location and condition of RVF vector habitats, thus making future control of the disease more promising.

AB An algorithm utilizing reflectance spectra bands in the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) region of the solar spectrum was developed for the remote estimation of the concentrations of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids in soybeans.  The defining of specific bands in the reflectance spectrum that corresponded to absorption bands of the individual pigments was basic to the development of the algorithm.  The detection of these bands was rendered difficult by the lack of detail in reflectance spectra.  It was therefore necessary to manipulate the reflectance spectra so that absorption bands due to specific pigments could be detected and their spectral maxima defined.  It was found that by dividing soybean reflectance spectra by an arbitrarily selected reference soybean reflectance spectrum, ratio spectra were obtained in which the absorption bands could be distinctly seen and their wavelength defined.  These ratio spectra allowed the defining of those bands corresponding to the absorption bands of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids.  The strong linear relationships of certain combinations of the bands in the ratio spectra to the concentrations of the photosynthetic pigments made it possible to develop a ratio analysis of reflectance spectra algorithm (RARS) by which the concentrations of these pigments could be calculated from the reflectance spectra.  The measurements necessary for the development of RARS were made using soybeans which were grown at different nitrogen levels in order to obtain a range of reflectance spectra.  A test of the RARS algorithm using other soybean plants showed very good agreement between measured pigment values and those calculated using RARS.

AB A new satellite remote sensing method for estimating the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) incident at the earth's surface is described and tested.  Potential incident PAR for clear sky conditions is computed from an existing spectral model.  Actual incident PAR is estimated by accounting for the attenuation of PAR due to reflectance by clouds.  PAR reflectance from clouds is inferred from ultraviolet (UV) reflectance at 370 nm, based on the evidently constant reflectivity of clouds across UV and PAR wavebands.  A major advantage of the UV approach over existing visible band approaches to estimating insolation is the improved ability to discriminate clouds from high-albedo background surfaces.  UV spectral reflectance data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) were used to test the approach for three climatically distinct, midlatitude locations.  Estimates of monthly total incident PAR from the satellite technique differed from values computed from ground-based pyranometer measurements by less than 6%.  This UV remote sensing method can be applied to estimate PAR insolation over ocean and land surfaces which are free of ice and snow.

ID REFLECTANCE MODEL; PLANT CANOPY; INVERSION
AB Special measurements of barley and clover canopy directional reflectance in the red and NIR spectral regions during vegetative growth were carried out to test the Nilson - Kuusk canopy reflectance model.  The model reproduces adequately the measured angular distribution of red reflectance.  Systematic differences are observed in the NIR spectral region.  Using a simple inversion procedure, the canopy optical and structural parameters are determined from optical reflectance measurements in one or two spectral regions.  The results of inversion agree reasonably well with those of phytometric measurements.  The disagreement between the measured and calculated NIR reflectance profiles gives rise to difficulties in inversion in NIR channel, and this is the reason why simultaneous measurements in two spectral regions had no advantage in model parameter estimation.  Obviously, the Nilson - Kuusk model needs some improvement in the NIR spectral region.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPERATURE; OCEAN; SPEED
AB A new real-time data source for sound speed in the upper 100 m has recently been proposed for exploratory development at the Naval Oceanographic and Atmospheric Research Laboratory.  This data source would be generated via a ship- or aircraft-mounted, optical pulsed laser using the technique of spontaneous Brillouin scattering.  This system should be capable (from a single 10 ns 500 mJ pulse) of yielding range resolved (almost-equal-to 1 m resolution) sound speed profiles in water to depths of 75-100 m to an accuracy of 1 m / s.  At aircraft speeds of 300 miles / h (134 m / s) and a laser pulse repetition rate of 10 pps, vertical profiles of sound speed would be obtained spatially every 13 m.  These 100 m profiles would provide the capability of rapidly monitoring the upper-ocean vertical structure for much of the world's oceans and for most seasons.  They would provide new perspectives on upper-ocean mixing and the oceanic internal wave field.  These profiles would also provide an extensive, new, subsurface-data source to existing real-time, operational ocean nowcast / forecast systems.  The present systems are dependent on sparse bathythermograph data and information inferred from sea-surface data.  Extension of the 100 m profiles to depth using existing and proposed techniques would further increase the value of the laser-derived information.

AB Imagery was acquired by the Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (AIS-2) over adjacent plots of control (natural) and water-stressed canopies of Norway spruce and white pine, and analyzed for differences in near-infrared reflectance features. Water stress had been induced in the trees by severing the sapwood and was assessed with shoot water potential (PSI) and relative water content (RWC) measurements. Stressed Norway spruce was found to have approximately 20% greater relative reflectance in the 1.0-1.3-mu-m region compared to the control canopy in the image obtained at 0925 h 13 days after stress induction. The difference in PSI and RWC between stressed and control was measured at 1.2 MPa and estimated at 7%, respectively. However, the difference in reflectance decreased to insignificance in the image taken at 1219 h that same day when the differences in PSI and RWC were approximately 0.72 MPa and 5%. In white pine, no significant differences in reflectance between stressed and control canopies were found in images obtained 14 days and 20 days after treatment with estimated differences in PSI and RWC of 0.3 MPa and 6%. Because extensive ground data was required at times of AIS-2 overflights to detect these small reflectance differences, we believe that water stress in conifer canopies may not be routinely detectable at an operational landscape scale.

AB Oceanic phytoplankton chlorophyll is known to produce a very significant influence on the optical properties of the ocean.  The chlorophyll-driven optical properties are in fact so strong as to allow global satellite mapping of the pigment concentration in the upper ocean using upwelled water-leaving radiances.  In this paper, extensive experimental evidence is presented to strongly suggest that upwelled water-leaving spectral radiances (and therefore the submarine light field source) also include physical scattering and absorption effects of photosynthetic accessory pigments such as phycoerythrin.  In the water column, the presence of phycoerythrin was measured over wide regions of the ocean using well-established airborne laser-induced spectral fluorescence techniques.  Active-passive correlation spectroscopy methods revealed that concurrently measured water-leaving spectral radiances in the almost-equal-to 600 nm spectral region were highly correlated with the laser-induced phycoerythrin pigment fluorescence.  The analysis was performed on data sets in which the phycoerythrin and chlorophyll fluorescence were not coherent in order to permit the unambiguous evaluation of results.

AB European forests are among the most extensively studied ecosystems in the world, yet there are still debates about their recent dynamics. We modeled the changes in tree canopy height across Europe from 2001 to 2021 using the multidecadal spectral data from the Landsat archive and calibration data from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidars. Annual tree canopy height was modeled using regression tree ensembles and integrated with annual tree canopy removal maps to produce harmonized tree height map time series. From these time series, we derived annual tree canopy extent maps using a >= 5 m tree height threshold. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) for both ALS-calibrated and GEDI-calibrated tree canopy height maps was <= 4 m. The user's and producer's accuracies estimated using reference sample data are >= 94% for the tree canopy extent maps and >= 80% for the annual tree canopy removal maps. Analyzing the map time series, we found that the European tree canopy extent area increased by nearly 1% overall during the past two decades, with the largest increase observed in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, and the British Isles. However, after the year 2016, the tree canopy extent in Europe declined. Some regions reduced their tree canopy extent between 2001 and 2021, with the highest reduction observed in Fennoscandia (3.5% net decrease). The continental extent of tall tree canopy forests (>= 15 m height) decreased by 3% from 2001 to 2021. The recent decline in tree canopy extent agrees with the FAO statistics on timber harvesting intensification and with the increasing extent and severity of natural disturbances. The observed decreasing tree canopy height indicates a reduction in forest carbon storage capacity in Europe.

AB The triangle/trapezoid framework model (TFM) is a widely used approach for mapping regional evapotranspiration (ET) based on thermal infrared remote sensing imagery. However, the homogeneity assumption for meteorological forcing and surface properties involved in TFM contradicts the characteristics of heterogeneous regions, leading to high uncertainty at regional scale, especially under energy-limited or strong advection conditions. Therefore, this study examined the linear relationship between soil moisture availability (Lambda SM), evapotranspiration efficiency (Lambda ET) and radiation surface temperature (Trad), and developed an Independent Framework-based dual-source ET Model (IFEM) for heterogeneous regions. By fixing two key meteorological forcing variables, air temperature (Ta) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and three surface characteristic parameters, aerodynamic resistance (ra), albedo (alpha) and the ratio of soil heat flux to net radiation (Gamma), the IFEM constructs a uniform fractional vegetation cover (fc)- Trad space. In this uniform fc-Trad space, isolines of Lambda SM and Lambda ET are aligned with those of Trad, and an independent trapezoid framework is constructed for each pixel of RS images. It avoids the systematic bias caused by the distorted trapezoid space involved in traditional TFMs. The proposed model was applied in a hydrologically semi-enclosed irrigation area, the Hetao Irrigation District, with Landsat and MODIS datasets from 2016 to 2020 to evaluate its performance at the field and region scales. Firstly, the IFEM was capable of retrieving latent heat with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 34.43 W m- 2 and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.68%, compared with the measurements from flux towers. Secondly, the IFEM reasonably separated the soil (MAPE = 21.33%) and canopy (MAPE = 14.33%) components from ET, compared with the soil evaporation observed by micro-lysimeters and the plant transpiration calculated by sap velocity upscaling technology. Thirdly, the IFEM showed high accuracy in estimating annual total ET with a percentage error range within +/- 3.0%, compared against the regional water balance calculations. Overall, the IFEM demonstrated high robustness and accuracy for field-scale and regional-scale applications, validating its potential as a reliable method for mapping regional ET in heterogeneous regions.

AB Data of chlorophyll (Chl-a) concentration obtained from polar-orbiting ocean color satellite sensors are subject to major spatial and temporal gaps in data coverage owing to the intrinsically low sampling frequency that coincides with adverse conditions such as cloud obstruction. Such gaps can be minimized with geostationary satellites owing to their higher scanning frequency over a given region, allowing more sampling opportunities as clouds move. However, geostationary ocean color missions have not been available for most regions of the globe. The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) aboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R series (GOES-R) is a potential alternative for the U.S. owing to improved signal-to-noise ratio compared with its predecessors. Nonetheless, retrieving [Chl-a] from ABI measurements is challenging; the number, placement, and width of its spectral bands are suboptimal and an "ocean-grade"atmospheric correction scheme is lacking. Here we describe the construction of a deep learning-based algorithm to derive [Chl-a] from GOES-16 ABI L1B radiance and ancillary data without an explicit atmospheric correction algorithm. A large (& SIM;22 million examples) training dataset of paired ABI observations and [Chl-a] estimates derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) were used to train, test and validate a 10-layer deep neural network model to retrieve [Chl-a] from ABI data. Preliminary results show that without atmospheric correction but with the aid of deep learning, it is possible to detect open ocean features with strong contrast such as across eddies and fronts, but there are still significant issues in coastal waters and occasionally in the open oceans. In general, the ABI-derived [Chl-a] agrees reasonably well with VIIRS-derived values in the open ocean during 3-5 h of the day. The location of oceanographic features such as fronts and eddies in the ABI-derived [Chl-a] maps are also coincident with those obtained from traditional ocean color and sea surface temperature retrievals. The findings of this study demonstrate that deep learning is a powerful tool for capturing intricate patterns that are too subtle for traditional algorithms developed by humans, Furthermore, the utilization of GOES-R ABI has the potential to complement polar-orbiting satellite data and mitigate data gaps.

AB Arctic-boreal wetlands, important ecosystems for biodiversity and ecological services, are experiencing hydrological changes including permafrost thaw, earlier snowmelt, and increased wildfire susceptibility. These changes are affecting wetland productivity, species diversity, and biogeochemical cycles. However, given the diverse forms and structures of wetland vegetation communities, traditional wetland maps generated from lower spatial and spectral resolution satellite imagery lack community-level vegetation classification and miss spatially complex patterns. In this study, we built a cloud-based workflow to map wetland vegetation community of the Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD), Canada, by leveraging high-resolution (5-m) airborne multi-sensor datasets, namely NASA's Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), and a historical LiDAR archive. Validation of our classifications using ground references indicates that classifications derived from AVIRIS-NG have higher accuracies (& GE;87.9%) than either UAVSAR (65.6%) or LiDAR (75.9%) for mapping wetland vegetation communities. We also show improved classification accuracy when combining information from multiple sensors. In particular, incorporating AVIRIS-NG and UAVSAR datasets substantially reduced omission errors of wet graminoid and wet shrub classes from 29.6% to 20.5% and from 10.8% to 7.5%, respectively. Combining AVIRIS-NG and LiDAR datasets further improves overall accuracy (+2.2%) for most classifications, especially emergent vegetation, wet graminoid, and wet shrub. The best performing model, using features derived from all three sensors, achieved an overall accuracy of 93.5%. The framework established here can be used to leverage extensive airborne AVIRISNG and UAVSAR datasets collected across Alaska and northwest Canada to understand the spatial distribution of Arctic-Boreal wetland vegetation communities.

AB Forest floor vegetation can account for a notable fraction of forest productivity and species diversity, and the composition of forest floor vegetation is an important indicator of site type. The signal from the forest floor influences the interpretation of optical remote sensing (RS) data. Retrieval of forest floor reflectance properties has commonly been investigated with multiangular RS data, which often have a coarse spatial resolution. We developed a method that utilizes a forest reflectance model based on photon recollision probability to retrieve forest floor reflectance from near-nadir data. The method was tested in boreal, hemiboreal, and temperate forests in Europe, with hemispherical photos and airborne LiDAR as alternative data sources to provide forest canopy structural information. These two data sources showed comparable performance, thus demonstrating the value of using airborne LiDAR as the structural reflectance model input to derive wall-to-wall maps of forest floor reflectance. We derived such maps from multispectral Sentinel-2 MSI and hyperspectral PRISMA satellite images for a boreal forest site. The validation against in situ measurements showed fairly good performance of the retrievals in sparse forests (that had effective plant area index less than 2). In dense forests, the retrievals were less accurate, due to the small contribution of forest floor to the RS signal. We also demonstrated the use of the method in monitoring the recovery of forest floor vegetation after a thinning disturbance. The reflectance model that we used is computationally efficient, making it well applicable also to data from new and forthcoming hyperspectral satellite missions.

AB The obtention of wall-to-wall fire severity estimates through reliable remote sensing-based techniques that align with management needs is a critical factor in post-fire decision-making processes. In this paper, we novelty proposed a multi-date change detection framework based on the variation in fractional vegetation cover (FCOVER), with enough ecological sense and physical basis to be generalizable across different plant commu-nities and burned landscapes with varying environmental conditions. This framework meets the definition of fire severity operationally used in the field as a biophysical indicator when fire effects on the understory and overstory layers are linked. The FCOVER was retrieved from Sentinel-2 surface reflectance scenes by inverting PROSAIL-D radiative transfer model (RTM) simulations using the random forest regression algorithm. FCOVER retrievals were validated in the field using burned and unburned control plots. We computed the FCOVERr metric as the ratio of post-fire to pre-fire FCOVER. We tested the relationship of the FCOVERr and the most common bi-temporal spectral indices in the literature, i.e. the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), the Relative dNBR (RdNBR) and the Relativized Burn Ratio (RBR), with the Composite Burn Index (CBI) measured in field plots for validation purposes in two case-study wildfires in the western Mediterranean Basin. We also calculated the transferability of FCOVERr and the spectral indices between different plant communities within each site, as well as between sites. The predictive errors of pre and post-fire FCOVER retrievals were found to be low (RMSE approximate to 10%) for the two study sites. Overall, the FCOVERr metric provided more accurate CBI estimations (R2 = 0.87 +/- 0.04) than spectral indices (R2 = 0.71 +/- 0.13). The CBI was linearly related with the FCOVERr metric for both sites, whereas the type of relationship with spectral indices was not consistent, which translated into better transferability performance of the FCOVERr metric (nRMSE = 14.27% +/- 3.75%) than that of the spectral indices (nRMSE = 21.97% +/- 8.09%), not only between different Mediterranean plant communities within sites, but also between the two sites. Spectral indices underestimated moderate to high fire severity to a greater extent than FCOVERr in the CBI field plots, and misclassified fire severity in several areas with patchiness fire effects identified in the field. The FCOVERr product proposed in this study may be a sound choice for the operational identification of priority areas for post-fire management.

AB The microwave emission of snow has distinctive, frequency-dependent characteristics that enable the use of passive microwave remote sensing for the detection of (dry) snow alongside the study of further snow properties. Passive microwave approaches for the retrieval of snow water equivalent (SWE) often implement dry snow detection as one of the main processing steps. Reliable dry snow detection is thus crucial; however, common algorithms tend to underestimate snow cover extent. This study conducts a long-term assessment of six dry snow detection algorithms as part of ongoing GlobSnow SWE product development. We focus on terrestrial snow on the Northern Hemisphere, using exhaustive in situ snow depth measurements and spatially complete snow maps by the NOAA Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS). In addition to using conventional daily snow masks, cumulative snow masks are investigated as means to counteract underestimation and the results emphasise their potential for this purpose. Best performances are achieved by the cumulative versions of the algorithm of the EUMETSAT H SAF H11 product and of the decision tree by Grody and Basist (1996), which agree with in situ data by approximately 81% and 84% whilst differing from IMS maps by only about 15% and 11%, respectively. Their validation for hemispheric SWE retrieval in the GlobSnow framework, using in situ snow course SWE observations, shows a noticeable improvement of the current statistics especially during shallow snow conditions in autumn-reducing the bias by up to 2.2 mm and the RMSE by up to 2.0 mm. This highlights the impact that the algorithm choice for dry snow detection has on the quality of SWE retrieval and therefore on long-term climate data records.

AB The uncertainty in the multiscale validation of coarse-pixel satellite albedo product significantly reduces the reliability of validation results but has not yet been quantitatively assessed. To close this knowledge gap, this study first analyzed the main uncertainty factors in the procedure of multiscale validation, and then proposed the quantification method for measuring the uncertainty caused by different factors. Finally, the propagation law of these uncertainty factors into the final uncertainty of validation results was established. Our analysis demonstrates that the uncertainty of multiscale validation mainly comes from the errors in high-resolution albedo maps, the errors generated in the upscaling process, and the errors caused by the geolocation mismatch between reference albedo and satellite albedo. These uncertainty factors are uncorrelated with each other and linearly propagated into the final uncertainty of validation results. The influence of these uncertainty factors partly depends on their magnitudes and partly depends on their weighting coefficients. The systematic errors in highresolution albedo maps propagate into the errors of pixel scale ground "truth" linearly with slope coefficients equal to or slightly smaller than 1, depending on the std. of noise. And then the pixel scale ground "truth" propagates into the final validation results with the weighting coefficient close to -1. But the non-systematic errors are more likely to be balanced out through the upscaling process in the case of a small subpixel size. The errors generated in the upscaling procedure are generally within the range of -3%-3%. Moreover, their negative weighting coefficients are very small, with a magnitude of less than 0.01. Consequently, the contribution of the errors generated in the upscaling process is negligibly small. By contrast, the errors caused by geolocation mismatch are significant, with the values ranging from -10% to 25%, which exceed the 5% accuracy requirement of satellite albedo products proposed by GCOS. Furthermore, its contribution to the overall uncertainty of validation results is significant, with large weighting coefficients close to 1. The magnitudes of these uncertainty factors and their weighting coefficients show dependence on subpixel sizes. Generally, a fine subpixel size is preferred in multiscale validation because it not only reduces the influence of non-systematic errors of high-resolution albedo maps but also enables more stable and reliable upscaling results. This study deepens the consciousness and understanding of the uncertainty embedded in multiscale validation results, which takes an important step toward more reliable validation over heterogeneous surfaces.

AB Global sea-level rise due to climate change is a critical problem for coastal cities. One of the coastal cities in Indonesia, Semarang, is in danger of being submerged by seawater due to flooding, which is exacerbated by land subsidence. Time-series analysis based on persistent scatterer (PS) interferometry usually suffers from sparse measurement points (MP), and thus does not completely cover the study area with low coherence. In this study, we utilized improved combined scatterers interferometry with optimized point scatterers (ICOPS) to increase the MP density. We also compared the optimization of the ICOPS method based on support vector regression (SVR) with convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. The ICOPS-CNN showed better model performance and MP density, and was less time-consuming. Further land subsidence analysis was conducted in Semarang using susceptibility mapping. The land subsidence susceptibility map from the standalone deep learning (DL) algorithm (CNN = 0.833) outperformed the standalone machine learning (ML) algorithm (SVR = 0.820). The hybrid DL algorithm with grey wolf optimizer (GWO) (CNN-GWO = 0.907) exhibited the highest accuracy, followed by the hybrid ML algorithm (SVR-GWO = 0.843). The accuracy was consistent with the comparison between the sus-ceptibility maps and the ICOPS measurements, resulting in a susceptibility map based on CNN-GWO with the highest accuracy (0.889). Land subsidence monitoring using ICOPS based on CNN and susceptibility mapping based on a hybrid DL algorithm (CNN-GWO) can be used by local governments to improve urban development planning in Semarang and its surrounding areas.

AB This work deals with a comprehensive multiparametric and multilayer approach to study earthquake-related processes that occur during the preparation phase of a large earthquake. As a case study, the paper in-vestigates the M7.2 Kermadec Islands (New Zealand) large earthquake that occurred on June 15, 2019 as the result of shallow reverse faulting within the Tonga-Kermadec subduction zone. The analyses focused on seismic (earthquake catalogs), atmospheric (climatological archives) and ionospheric data from ground to space (mainly satellite) in order to disclose the possible Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling (LAIC). The ionospheric investigations analysed and compared the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver network with in -situ observations from space thanks to both the European Space Agency (ESA) Swarm constellation and the China National Space Administration (CNSA in partnership with Italian Space Agency, ASI) satellite dedicated to search for possible ionospheric disturbances before medium-large earthquakes, i.e. the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01). An interesting comparison is made with another subsequent earthquake with comparable magnitude (M7.1) that occurred in Ridgecrest, California (USA) on 6 July of the same year but in a different tectonic context. Both earthquakes showed anomalies in several parameters (e.g. aerosol, skin temperature and some ionospheric quantities) that appeared at almost the same times before each earthquake occurrence, evidencing a chain of processes that collectively point to the moment of the corresponding mainshock. In both cases, it is demonstrated that a comprehensive multiparametric and multilayer analysis is fundamental to better understand the LAIC in the occasion of complex phenomena such as earthquakes.

AB The feasibility of a Linear Inversion Method applied to Synthetic Aperture Radar cross spectra to retrieve wave directional spectra is investigated. The proposed method is computationally efficient and does not require any a priori information from wave or atmospheric models, as is usually the case with other approaches. It is also comparatively less sensitive to low signal-to-noise ratio image spectra, which in general hinders the disambig-uation of the retrieved directional wave spectrum. Several test cases were computed employing a simulator of complex SAR image spectra considering a broad range of values of steepness for the Envisat and Sentinel-1 satellite configurations. The results of the simulated cases were employed as lookup tables to correct biases while retrieving directional wave spectra from Level 1 cross spectra. As the nonlinearities, not accounted for when applying a linear inversion, are dependent on satellite configuration and on the relative position of the peak wave spectrum in relation to the azimuth cut-off, it is possible to quantify them through numerical sim-ulations. The SAR wave spectra retrieved with the Linear Inversion Method from an Envisat ground track were evaluated against the ECMWF reanalysis ERA5 and compared to the results of ESA Level 2 WVW wave mode spectra. The SAR-inverted wave spectra, retrieved with both methods, presented similar results in terms of root -mean-square error (RMSE) and scatter index (SI) for significant wave height, peak wavelength and peak prop-agation direction. Specifically for significant wave height, the Linear Inversion Method yielded a bias of-0.14 m, a SI of 0.34 and a RMSE of 0.44 m for a segment of ground track over the Pacific Ocean employed in our val-idations. The directional wave spectra retrieved with the Linear Inversion Method presented better similarity with the ERA5 spectra, in comparison with the WVW spectra. Moreover, in around one third of the cases, the ESA method did not resolve the directional ambiguity. The preliminary results employing the Linear Inversion Method are encouraging, specially considering its simplicity and performance against the ESA distributed wave spectra.

AB Sea surface salinity (SSS) variability during the recent decade in the western subpolar North Atlantic is inves-tigated using three satellite salinity products, Aquarius, SMAP and SMOS, as well as in-situ observations. Satellite datasets successfully resolve the large scale SSS pattern but are significantly biased near the western boundary regions. Freshwater flux induced by sea ice formation/melting plays a dominant role in shaping the SSS annual cycle in the coastal regions of the western Labrador Sea, but data gaps and uncertainties prevent satellite products from accurately resolving the seasonality in the Labrador Shelf. On the other hand, seasonal fluctuations near the Grand Banks are reasonably captured in satellite data. They are essentially driven by both local freshwater flux associated with ice and advective signals from the north. The interannual variability of SSS is detectable in both in-situ observations and Aquarius. During the low salinity period in 2011-2012, interannual anomalies are no longer controlled by ice formation/melting. Instead, they are mostly determined by oceanic advection, which moves low salinity water around the Labrador Sea in a cyclonic direction. In addition, the Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Function (DINEOF) is applied to satellite datasets to weed out noise and fill data gaps. The resulting reconstructed datasets show apparent bias reduction and better performances in depicting seasonal cycles in both coastal region and deep ocean. DINEOF does not improve the capability of SMAP and SMOS in resolving the interannual anomalies as their original fields do not include such signals.

AB The availability and quality of quad-pol synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets has increased substantially since the early 2000s, allowing for polarimetrically complete investigations of freshwater ice. These inves-tigations have lead to improved ice classification methods, new understanding of microwave-ice scattering processes, and the potential for new methods to extract ice observables. Such analyses are predicated on the decomposition of the target's polarimetric properties along mathematical or physical lines. This paper comprehensively reviews the underlying theory and contemporary application of radar polarimetric decomposition as it applies to freshwater ice systems. Modelling and investigation of lake ice, river ice, and glacial systems are discussed. We conclude with recommendations for further research, discussing the value of further development of freshwater-ice models, their use in characterization of the scattering process, and the potential for new methods to extract environmental observables.

AB Quantitative evidence for the fundamental spectral shape similarity existing between different soils is presented utilizing Pearson's correlation and SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper) analysis in-between signatures representing thousands of soil samples collected from different environments around the world. A universal quadratic soil line (UQSL) was found to highly fit these representative signatures as well as spectra from the ISRIC (International Soil Reference and Information Center) global database including soil samples collected from 58 countries. K-means clustering of ISRIC spectral reflectance deviations from the UQSL facilitated identification of 5 characteristic deviation patterns. Significant correlation was found for a set of 1000 soil samples between changes in multiple chemical properties and corresponding reflectance changes between these clusters. Future availability of large global soil data bases may allow improved determination of the UQSL and generalization of its deviation patterns relationships with PBC (Physical, Biological and Chemical) properties for wide areas monitoring of soil conditions.

AB Accurate, spatially extensive, and frequent assessments of plant nitrogen (N) enabled by remote sensing allow growers to optimize fertilizer applications and reduce environmental impacts. Standard remote sensing methods for N assessment typically involve the use of chlorophyll-sensitive vegetation indices calculated from multi -spectral or hyperspectral reflectance data. However, the chlorophyll a + b derived from spectral indices is indirectly related to leaf N and saturates at high leaf N levels, dramatically reducing the sensitivity with leaf N under these conditions. Furthermore, these relationships are heavily influenced by canopy structure, variability in leaf area density, proportion of sunlit-shaded tree-crown components, soil background, and understory. Recent studies in uniform crops have demonstrated that estimation of plant N can be improved by considering leaf biochemical constituents derived from radiative transfer model (RTM) and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF). However, it is unclear whether these methods are transferable to tree crops due to their intrinsic physiological differences, structural complexity, and within-tree crown heterogeneity. We investigated how various hyper -spectrally derived proxies for leaf N, including RTM-based traits and SIF, could be combined to assess N status on a 1200-ha almond orchard across two growing seasons. RTM-based chlorophyll a + b content (C-ab) and SIF were found to be the most important and consistent predictors for leaf N compared to other leaf biochemical and biophysical traits. C-ab alone was a modest predictor of leaf N variability (r(2) = 0.49, RMSE = 0.16%, p-value < 0.001), but when the non-collinear SIF and C-ab traits were coupled together, predictions improved dramatically (r(2) = 0.95, RMSE = 0.05%, p-value < 0.001). Leaf area index (LAI) was poorly associated with leaf N, suggesting that leaf physiological traits may be more important than structural traits in quantifying leaf N in well-managed orchards characterized by high N levels. Consistent results across the 2 years suggests the importance of airborne SIF coupled with Cab for precision agriculture and leaf N status assessment in almond orchards.

AB Plant area density (PAD in m2 center dot m- 3) defines the total one-sided total plant surface area within a given volume. It is a key variable in characterizing exchange processes between the atmosphere and land surface. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) provides unprecedented detail of the 3D structure of forest canopies. Yet, signal occlusion and uneven sampling density of the TLS point clouds limit our capacity to characterize the 3D distribution of canopy components. Recent studies have made use of statistical estimators of PAD that are applied to TLS point clouds subdivided into three-dimensional (3D) cubes, or voxels. Computation of such metrics under actual field conditions with point clouds containing several millions of returns is challenging. Moreover, rigorous assessment of the estimated PAD and effects of occlusions in forests remain unclear due to laborious, time-consuming, and inaccurate field measurements. In the present study, we present L-Vox, a software that computes PAD per voxel for TLS scans acquired in forest environments, which is based upon recent development of unbiased estimators derived from maximum likelihood. Two applications are presented. First, the software is evaluated for virtual forest plots, which are detailed 3D models of individual trees with corresponding simulated TLS scans, for which reference data are known. Second, L-Vox is applied to actual scans that were acquired in hardwood and coniferous plots in New Brunswick and Newfoundland, Canada. Both test cases were used to investigate the effects of occlusion and the uneven sampling in estimating PAD. The test cases were also used to assess the influence of voxel size and the number of scans per plot on PAD estimates. Our results showed strong correlations between the estimated PAD profile from L-Vox and simulated PAD for virtual forest plots, with a mean R2 = 0.98 and a mean coefficient of variation (CV) = 15.6%. We demonstrated that comparing multi-scan to single scan TLS acquisitions in real forest plots substantially reduced signal occlusion, resulting in an increase up to 50% in PAD values. Effects of voxel size on PAD estimates greatly depended upon the relative size of foliar and woody elements, with an optimal size around 10 cm in coniferous plots. L-Vox proved to be an efficient and accurate tool for computing 3D distributions of PAD from TLS measurements in natural forest environments.

AB Soot deposition from wildfires decreases snow and ice albedo and increases the absorption of shortwave radiation, which advances and accelerates melt. Soot deposition also induces algal growth, which further decreases snow and ice albedo. In recent years, increasingly severe and widespread wildfire activity has occurred in western Canada in association with climate change. In the summers of 2017 and 2018, westerly winds transported smoke from extensive record-breaking wildfires in British Columbia eastward to the Canadian Rockies, where substantial amounts of soot were deposited on high mountain glaciers, snowfields, and icefields. Several studies have addressed the problem of soot deposition on snow and ice, but the spatiotemporal resolution applied has not been compatible with studying mountain icefields that are extensive but contain substantial internal variability and have dynamical albedos. This study evaluates spatial patterns in the albedo decrease and net shortwave radiation (K*) increase caused by soot from intense wildfires in Western Canada deposited on the Columbia Icefield (151 km(2)), Canadian Rockies, during 2017 and 2018. Twelve Sentinel-2 images were used to generate high spatial resolution albedo retrievals during four summers (2017 to 2020) using a MODIS bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model, which was employed to model the snow and ice reflectance anisotropy. Remote sensing estimates were evaluated using site-measured albedo on the icefield's Athabasca Glacier tongue, resulting in a R-2, mean bias, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.68, 0.019, and 0.026, respectively. The biggest inter-annual spatially averaged soot-induced albedo declines were of 0.148 and 0.050 (2018 to 2020) for southeast-facing glaciers and the snow plateau, respectively. The highest inter-annual spatially-averaged soot-induced shortwave radiative forcing was 203 W/m(2) for southeast-facing glaciers (2018 to 2020) and 106 W/m(2) for the snow plateau (2017 to 2020). These findings indicate that snow albedo responded rapidly to and recovered rapidly from soot deposition. However, ice albedo remained low the year after fire, and this was likely related to a bio-albedo feedback involving microorganisms. Snow and ice K* were highest during low albedo years, especially for south-facing glaciers. These large-scale effects accelerated melt of the Columbia Icefield. The findings highlight the importance of using large-area high spatial resolution albedo estimates to analyze the effect of wildfire soot deposition on snow and ice albedo and K* on icefields, which is not possible using other approaches.

AB Old-growth forests of different ages provide specific structures, habitats and ecosystem services. Methods to distinguish this internal diversity are still rare, especially in boreal forests. This research therefore aims to determine the ability of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) technology to identify age-related structural diversity in old-growth boreal forests. The study area was located in primary boreal forests in Quebec (Canada) dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana). This area contained 71.8 km(2) of early old-growth forests (burned 110 years ago), 17.1 km2 of late old-growth forests (protected areas; unburned for at least 250 years) and 370 km(2) of old-growth forests of unknown age (> 125-years-old). We divided the study area into 1 ha tiles, where we extracted seven ALS indices representing vertical and horizontal forest structure. We trained random forest models using an iterative approach to discriminate between early and late old-growth forests based on ALS indices. Model predictions were applied to the old-growth tiles of unknown age, and to 86 field plots (28 from provincial forest surveys and 58 from a dedicated survey of old-growth forests) to evaluate the predictive capacity of the models. The models very accurately distinguished early and late old-growth forests (error-rate = 4.9%). Old-growth survey plots confirmed model ability to discriminate early and late old-growth forests, but not provincial survey plots, possibly because of a lower reliability of these data when forest age exceeds 150 years. Model predictions for tiles of unknown age highlighted the presence of very large tracts of late old-growth forests within a matrix of old-growth forests of intermediate age (asymptotic to 150-200 years). Overall, ALS-data can contribute to a finer structural age distinction and mapping of boreal old-growth forests. This enhanced knowledge of old-growth landscapes will greatly help to improve their protection, restoration and management. The scarcity of reliable field data for model evaluation is, however, a limitation to be addressed.

AB Global urbanization changes land cover patterns and affects the living environment of humans. However, urbanization and its evolution process, i.e., conversions among diverse land covers, are hard to measure, as existing land cover maps usually have low temporal resolutions; conversely, long-term and temporally dense land cover maps, such as vegetation-impervious-soil decomposition maps base on MODIS, ignore the important land cover of cropland in urban evolution process (UEP). To resolve the issue, this study suggests a novel model named time extended non-crop vegetation-impervious-cropland (Time V-I-C) to represent and quantify different stages of UEP; then, a normalized multi-objective T-ConvLSTM (NMT) method is proposed to unmix cropland, non-crop vegetation, and impervious based on the intra-annual remotely-sensed time series, and obtain their fractions in each pixel for generating UEP maps. Consequently, UEP maps from 2001 to 2018 are generated for two Chinese urban agglomerations, i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Yangtze River Delta urban agglomerations. The mapping results have high accuracies with a small standard error of regression (SER) of 13.1%, small root mean square error (RMSE) of 12.6%, and small mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.4%, and the maps reveal the different UEP in the two urban agglomerations. Therefore, this study provides a new idea for expressing UEP and contributes to a wide range of urbanization studies and sustainable city development.

AB Recent advances in instruments and retrieval methods enable measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) across a wide range of scales. Radiative transfer (RT) models for simulating scattering and (re-) absorption of SIF provide a powerful tool to study the upscaling of SIF signal from leaf level to terrestrial ecosystems. Based on the Monte Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) model, WPS (Weighted Photon Spread), we made major extensions with new functionalities and systematic evaluation of the new modules. By modeling the radiative coupling between atmosphere and land surface with the same MCRT method, the non-fluorescent and SIF radiance received by sensors can be simulated at levels from top-of canopy to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) in a coherent manner. New extension to represent the three-dimensional (3-D) canopies with geometrical primitives composed of turbid medium makes the hyperspectral simulation (especially SIF) for a sensor with medium spatial resolution at kilometer-scale feasible and practical. Evaluations through ROMC (Radiation transfer model intercomparison Online Model Checker) show that the accuracy of the new module of 3-D structure representation in WPS is within 1% of the reference solution. The spectra of TOA radiance and SIF and their components simulated at nadir by WPS agree closely with those simulated by the coupled SCOPE and MODTRAN models with the coefficient of determination (R-2) higher than 0.99 and the average absolute relative error (AARE) lower than 6.39%; for angular distributions of TOA radiance and SIF at 685 nm and 740 nm, R-2 is higher than 0.81 and AARE is lower than 6.94%. Comparisons of the spectra of TOA radiance and SIF and their components simulated at nadir by WPS and the DART model give R-2 higher than 0.99 and AARE lower than 3.5%; R-2 is higher than 0.92 and AARE is lower than 5.92% for the TOA angular simulations. The WPS model was also evaluated by hyperspectral measurements through unmanned aerial vehicle at different altitudes, which shows that WPS can reproduce the spectral features of a rapeseed crop. WPS can be used as a versatile tool to assess the impacts of various factors on the SIF signal and to evaluate the SIF retrieval methods under different conditions.

AB High resolution satellite images with improved spatial and temporal resolution provide unprecedented opportunities to monitor Earth Surface changes in 2D and 3D due, for example, to earthquakes, sand dune migration, ice flow, or landslides. The volume of imagery available for such measurements is rapidly growing but the exploitation of these data is challenging due to the various sources of geometric distortions of the satellite imagery. Here we propose a new approach to extract high-quality surface displacement in 3D based on the correlation of multi-date and multi-platform high resolution optical imagery. We additionally show that when a large enough volume of data is available, it is possible to separate the deformation signal from the artifacts due to the satellite jitter and misalignment of the CCDs, which, together with topographic artifacts, are the main source of noise in the measurements. Our method makes use of a reference DEM, but the outcome is independent of the characteristics of the chosen DEM. We use the case-example of the ground deformation caused by the Ridgecrest earthquake sequence to assess the performance of our proposed approach. We show that it outperforms the more standard approach which combines 2-D correlation and DEM differencing. With our technique, we were able to generate high quality measurements of coseismic ground displacement with GSD of 2.4 m, and uncertainties at the 90% confidence level on the NS, EW and vertical displacement measurements of 0.6 m, 0.7 m, and 0.6 m respectively.

AB Remotely-sensed Ocean color data offer a unique opportunity for studying variations of bio-optical properties which is especially valuable in the Arctic Ocean (AO) where in situ data are sparse. In this study, we re-processed the raw data from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View (SeaWiFS, 1998-2010) and the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, 2003-2016) ocean-color sensors to ensure compatibility with the first ocean color sensor, namely, the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS, 1979-1986). Based on a bio-regional approach, this study assesses the quality of this new homogeneous pan-Arctic Chl a dataset, which provides the longest (but non-continuous) ocean color time-series ever produced for the AO (37 years long between 1979 and 2016). We show that despite the temporal gaps between 1986 and 1998 due to the absence of ocean color satellite, the time series is suitable to establish a baseline of phytoplankton biomass for the early 1980s, before sea-ice loss accelerated in the AO. More importantly, it provides the opportunity to quantify decadal changes over the AO revealing for instance the continuous Chl a increase in the inflow shelves such as the Barents Sea since the CZCS era.

AB Observing functional diversity continuously in time and space using satellite imagery forms the basis for studying impact, interactions, and feedback of environmental change mechanisms on ecosystems and biodiversity globally. Functional diversity of plant traits links ecosystem functioning and biodiversity. This work presents an approach to map and quantify functional diversity of physiological forest traits derived from 20 m Sentinel-2 data in a temperate forest ecosystem. We used two complementary data sources, namely high-resolution, as well as spatially resampled airborne imaging spectroscopy data and Sentinel-2 data, to ensure our methods support consistently mapping functional diversity from space. We retrieved three physiological traits related to forest health, stress, and potential productivity, namely chlorophyll, carotenoid, and water content, from airborne imaging spectroscopy and Sentinel-2 data using corresponding spectral indices as proxies. We analyzed changes in two functional diversity metrics, namely functional richness and divergence, at different spatial resolutions. Both functional diversity metrics depend on the size and number of pixels to derive functional diversity as a function of distance, leading to different interpretations. When mapping functional diversity using Sentinel-2 data, small-scale patterns <1.1 ha were no longer visible, implying a minimum calculation area with 60 m radius recommended for retrieval of functional diversity metrics. The spectrally convolved and spatially resampled airborne spectroscopy data and the native Sentinel-2 data were correlated with r = 0.747 for functional richness and r = 0.709 for divergence in a 3.1 ha neighborhood. Functional richness was more affected by the differences in trait maps between the acquisitions resulting from effects in illumination and topography compared with functional divergence. Further differences could be explained by varying illumination/observation effects and phenological status of the vegetation at acquisition. Our approach demonstrates the importance of spatial and spectral resolution when scaling diversity assessments from regional to continental scales.

AB Tropical forests represent half of the Earth's remaining forest area, but they are shrinking at high rates, which poses a threat to their multiple ecosystem services. As a response, international environmental agreements and related programs require information about tropical forested landscapes. Despite the increasing quantity and quality of remote sensing-based data, the effective monitoring of forests in the tropics still faces operational challenges: (a) applicability at local levels, with lack of reference or cloud-free information; (b) overcoming geographical, ecological, or biophysical variability; (c): stratification, distinguishing forest categories related to functionality and disturbance history. We conducted an extensive ground verification campaign through 36 landscapes in 9 regions of Zambia, Ecuador and Philippines, which constitute a gradient of pantropical deforestation contexts or forest transitions. We collected over 16,000 ground control points and digitized over 18,000 ha with details on land use and forest disturbance history. We trained a random forest algorithm and generated high-resolution (30 m) binary forest maps covering ~15 Mha, building on 39 optical (Landsat-8), radar (Sentinel-1) and elevation bands, indices and textures. We validated the quality of the outputs across the studied deforestation gradient and compared them to (a): 3 national land cover maps used for international reporting, (b): 4 global forest datasets (Global Forest Change, Copernicus Land Cover, JAXA and TanDEM-X Forest/Non-Forest). Our method generated highly accurate (92%) forest maps for the studied regions when compared to the global datasets, which generally overestimated forest cover. We achieved accuracies similar to the national maps, following a standardized method for all countries. The difficulties in delineating forest increased in more advanced stages of deforestation, with recurring struggles to distinguish non-forest tree-based systems (e.g. perennials, palms, or agroforestry), shrublands and grasslands. Regrowth forests were repeatedly misclassified across contexts, countries and datasets, in contrast to reference or degraded forests. Our results highlight the importance of in situ verification as accompanying method to establish efficient forest monitoring systems, especially in areas with higher rates of forest cover change and in tropical regions of advanced deforestation or early reforestation stages. These are precisely the areas where current REDD+ or Forest Landscape Restoration initiatives take place.

AB In preparation of the Thermal infraRed Imaging Satellite for High-resolution Natural resource Assessment (TRISHNA) mission, we conducted a thorough analysis of sensitivity for the Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) method to the position of the four TRISHNA spectral channels, notably to find an optimal spectral configuration. To that purpose, we designed a fast-computing end-to-end simulator including several components, which we implemented to simulate both pixel-size TRISHNA measurements and land surface temperature (LST) retrievals. Firstly, simulations were conducted over a wide range of realistic scenarii, notably by including vegetation canopy-scale cavity effect. Secondly, the experimental design included the features of second generation Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (MCT) cooled detectors with lower instrumental noises and finer channels. Thirdly, as opposed to previous studies that used predefined spectral configurations to determine the most suited one, we conducted an optimization of the spectral configuration by crossing, on a pair basis, several positions of the four TIR channels over a range of wavelengths. Fourthly, we quantified the TES sensitivity to atmospheric perturbations, by comparing LST retrievals with and without atmospheric noise. We observed an overall moderate sensitivity of TES LST retrievals to the spectral channel positions, with a maximum RMSE variation of 0.31 K within the atmospheric spectral windows. Furthermore, the TES method was sensitive to three main parameters, namely the instrumental noise, the atmospheric downwelling irradiance, and the transmittance due to ozone and water vapor, with RMSEs larger than 1 K for specific channel locations. Moreover, by considering possible superimposition of two channels, we noted that the TES method could achieve similar performance by considering three or four channels. Eventually, our study enabled us to recommend a new spectral configuration for the TRISHNA TIR instrument, that is more robust to atmospheric perturbations and to uncertainties on channel positions and bandwidths.

AB L-band passive microwave remote sensing is currently considered a robust technique for global monitoring of soil moisture. However, soil roughness complicates the relationship between brightness temperature and soil moisture, with current soil moisture retrieval algorithms typically assuming a constant roughness parameter globally, leading to a potential degradation in retrieval accuracy. This current investigation established a towerbased experiment site in Victoria, Australia. P-band (-40-cm wavelength/0.75 GHz) was compared with L-band (-21-cm wavelength/1.41 GHz) over random and periodic soil surfaces to determine if there is an improvement in brightness temperature simulation and soil moisture retrieval accuracy for bare soil conditions, due to reduced roughness impact when using a longer wavelength. The results showed that P-band was less impacted by random and periodic roughness than L-band, evidenced by more comparable statistics across different roughness conditions. The roughness effect from smooth surfaces (e.g., 0.8-cm root-mean-square height and 11.1-cm correlation length) could be potentially ignored at both P- and L-band with satisfactory simulation and retrieval performance. However, for rougher soil (e.g., 1.6-cm root-mean-square height and 6.8-cm correlation length), the roughness impact needed to be accounted for at both P- and L-band, with P-band observations showing less impact than L-band. Moreover, a sinusoidal soil surface with 10-cm amplitude and 80-cm period substantially impacted the brightness temperature simulation and soil moisture retrieval at both P- and L-band, which could not be fully accounted for using the SMOS and SMAP default roughness parameters. However, when retrieving roughness parameters along with soil moisture, the ubRMSE at P-band over periodic soil was improved to a similar level (0.01-0.02 m3/m3) as that of smooth flat soil (0.01 m3/m3), while L-band showed higher ubRMSE over the periodic soil (0.03-0.04 m3/m3) than over smooth flat soil (0.01 m3/m3). Accordingly, periodic roughness effects were reduced by using observations at P-band.

AB Lespedeza cuneata (sericea lespedeza; hereafter "sericea") is an invasive species brought to the U.S. from East Asia in the 1890s to be used as forage. However, it has now become a growing ecological and economic threat in grasslands of several states in the U.S. southern Great Plains including Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska. Here, we demonstrate the capability of airborne imaging spectroscopy to map sericea in a large natural grassland within the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, the largest protected tallgrass prairie in the world, located in northeastern Oklahoma. Through this research, we investigated which remotely observable vegetation functional traits (referring to biochemical, physiological, and structural traits) contribute to distinguishing sericea from cooccurring native species and whether we can detect sericea remotely through quantifying these functional traits using imaging spectroscopic data (also known as hyperspectral data). To achieve these objectives, full-range airborne hyperspectral data with spatial resolution of 1 m were collected from the study area in August 2020. In addition, a total of 12 vegetation functional traits were measured through field sampling for model development. We first identified functional traits that contributed to separating sericea from other species, and then used them in a classification model to detect sericea in our study site. We found total carotenoids (sum of neoxanthin, violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, and lutein), chlorophyll a + b (sum of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b), total nitrogen, canopy height, potassium, and magnesium as the main functional traits contributing to the detection of sericea; an overall classification accuracy of approximately 94% was reported. However, the proposed approach overestimated sericea cover in species-rich plant communities. Overall, our findings demonstrated an essential role for airborne remote sensing in 1) direct mapping of invasive plants and 2) quantifying functional traits associated with success strategies of invasive species. Eventually, experiments like ours can aid in developing large-scale and science-driven management practices to both identify the current extent, and to control the spread of invasive species in grasslands and similar short-stature environments. This will not only improve management practices but will have major societal and economic benefits.

AB In the TOPSAR acquisition mode, Sentinel-1 sensors acquire some data in passive mode, with a periodicity of approximately one second. These data provide valuable information about scene brightness and Radio Frequency pollution. This paper reviews the method to extract these passively sensed data and identify Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI). Two sets of measurements are generated by back-projecting passively sensed data on the ground, generating Earth Brightness Temperature (BT) and RFI equivalent temperature. A proper calibration has been implemented thanks to AMSR-2 data. The paper shows the result of one year of data collection from Sentinel 1 A and B regarding RFI and BT. We discuss the stability of the systems and the accuracy of the measurements by cross-comparing results from the two sensors, and we show how this information can be exploited for precise SAR data denoising and RFI mitigation.

AB Satellite altimetry is a key technique to measure water level change in continental water bodies. Altimetry-based water level time series of rivers are typically constructed at locations where the satellite ground tracks intersect the rivers, the so-called virtual stations. The relatively low sampling frequency (10-27 days) of the repeat missions may result in an under-sampling of the hydrological regime in rivers with sub-monthly to weekly events. We are currently in a unique position with more than a handful satellite altimetry missions simultaneously mapping the surface elevation of the Earth. In combination, these missions contain an unexploited potential to obtain a more detailed picture of the hydrological regime of many of the Earth's rivers. The task of combining water levels measured at different locations and/or by satellites with different orbits is however, challenging due to e.g. topography, intermission biases, variation in river morphology, and other unidentified causes. In this work, we present a new method to combine multi-mission altimetry-based water levels from a river reach. This will also enable the use of geodetic missions like CryoSat-2 and SARAL/AltiKa (after June 2016) in water level time series. To combine the data we set up a state-space model where the process part is a first-order autoregressive process. The observations as a function of time and distance along the reach are described as a sum of the water level at a given time scaled by a distance-dependent factor, the mean water level at the given distance, and an error term. The scale factor and the mean water level are modeled with spline functions. We employ the model for the six rivers Lena, Solimo similar to es, Mississippi, Danube, Po, and Red, which range in width from 3 km to a few hundred meters. For each river, we consider a reach of 200-300 km and apply water levels from the satellite altimetry missions CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3A/3B, and SARAL/AltiKa. The selected reach must have a continuous elevation profile and preferable no major tributaries, which might alter the hydrological regime considerably. The length of the reach is a compromise of ensuring enough data but not violating the aforementioned criteria. When validated against in situ data we find a root mean square error ranging from 0.34 m (Solimo similar to es River) to 2.53 m (Lena River) and a correlation ranging from 0.83 (Danube River) to 0.99 (Solimo similar to es River). These summary statistics are based on approximately 2000-3000 pairs of in situ and modeled water levels. We find the largest increase in detail for the reconstructed water levels for the Danube, Po, and Red Rivers, where the water level variations are under-sampled at the virtual stations. For the Po River, we can detect sub-weekly events with the model and for the Lena River, the spring flood related to ice and snowmelt is better captured when combining the data. An additional advantage of the approach is that the water level time series can be reconstructed at all locations along the considered reach.

AB Spartina alterniflora is an aggressive invasive plant spreading along the coastal China, spanning a latitudinal range of 20 degrees N-39 degrees N, and its invasion resulted in dramatic decline in both native plant diversity and ecosystem functioning. Phenology of S. alterniflora saltmarshes is a critical feature to elucidate the invasion dynamics over geographical regions but has not been well understood yet. In this study, we examined the variation of S. alterniflora saltmarsh phenology across coastal China during 2018-2020 by using time series Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 images. Combined Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 images provided more good-quality observations in a year, which could facilitate phenological retrieval. We applied and assessed three widely used phenology retrieval methods (i.e., NDVI-based pixel-specific statistical threshold, NDVI-based double logistic mathematical equation, and LSWI-based biological threshold) for retrieving the start and end of season (SOS and EOS) as well as the length of season (LOS) of S. alterniflora saltmarshes. The SOS and EOS dates derived from three phenology retrieval methods showed similar patterns in latitudinal phenology variation: SOS became later and LOS became shorter as latitude increased, and the latitudinal trend of EOS was not as large as that of SOS. This study shows the potential of Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 to quantify land surface phenology of S. alterniflora saltmarshes, which not only enhances our understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of coastal saltmarshes in China but also improves the management of this plant invader that threatens native saltmarshes in the world.

AB Knowledge of forest change type and timing is required for forest management, reporting, and science. Time series of historic satellite data (e.g. Landsat) have resulted in an invaluable record of changes in forest conditions. Natural resource management and reporting typically operate at an annual time step, yet the recent addition of data streams from compatible satellites (e.g., Sentinel-2) offer the possibility of generating frequent, management-relevant forest status assessments and maps of change. Analytical approaches that rely on a time series of observations to identify change often struggle to provide reliable estimates of change events in terminal years of the time series until subsequent, additional observations are available. Methods to meaningfully integrate observations from compatible satellite platforms can provide short-term information to augment and refine estimates of change area and type in those terminal years of the time series. In this research we fuse Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A and -2B data streams to capture, with reduced latency, stand replacing forest change (harvest and wildfire), tagged to a temporal window of occurrence over an similar to 10,000 km(2) area of central British Columbia, Canada. We introduce a new algorithm, SLIMS (Shrinking Latency in Multiple Streams), to rapidly and reliably detect change, and then use an established Bayesian approach to meaningfully combine changes detected in the Landsat and Sentinel data streams. Our results indicate that the type and timing of stand-replacing disturbances can be identified in these forests with high accuracy. Overall, 13.9% of the study area was disturbed between the end of 2016 and the end of 2017, with the majority of disturbed area attributable to wildfire and a smaller amount attributed to forest harvesting, mostly in the winter 2016-2017 with some limited summer harvest also occurring. Overall accuracy of the change, assessed using independent validation data, was 95% +/- 2.3%. The capacity of these change results to augment a trend-based assessment of change for 2017 was also demonstrated and provides a framework for how short- and long-term change detection approaches provide complementary information that can increase the timeliness and accuracy of change area estimates in the terminal years of a time series. These findings also demonstrate the capacity to regard Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors as elements of a virtual constellation to obtain forest change information in a timely (i.e., end of growing season) and reliable fashion over large areas.

AB A reliable accuracy is essential for the application of land surface temperature (LST) products. Current satellite retrieved LSTs are mainly validated over a few homogeneous sites. However, most of the existing ground sites are located in inhomogeneous areas: thus, their spatial representativeness on satellite pixel scales is unknown. In this situation, how to evaluate the spatial representativeness of these inhomogeneous sites, quantify the influence introduced by the spatial representativeness and describe the variation of the site's spatial representativeness are critical questions for satellite LST validation. In an attempt to answer those questions, a so-called temporal variation method (TVM) is proposed for evaluating a ground site's spatial representativeness. The method defines a spatial representativeness indicator (SRI), which is the LST difference between a ground radiometer's field-ofview (FOV) and a satellite pixel, and describes a site's spatial representativeness. Based on the temporal variation of LST, the SRI time series consists of three temporal components: increment ATC, increment DTCF-P, and increment USC, which describe the annual, diurnal, and instantaneous variations of SRI, respectively. Associated with the Landsat TM/ETM+ data and weather parameters, the method is implemented and tested at 16 Chinese ground sites for the validation of MODIS and AATSR LST products. Results show that the temporally continuous SRI (SRITPR) shows high correlations with the original SRI (SRIORI). The variation of SRITPR is mainly determined by changes in surface coverage (i.e. NDVI difference on the two scales) and affected by weather conditions (e.g. near-surface air temperature, accumulative downward solar radiation, and wind speed). Since the SRI is defined as the LST difference between the two scales, it can be used as a bridge to convert the in-situ LST to pixel scale to address the spatial scale mismatch in LST validation. With this idea, the in-situ LST at daytime was converted to pixel scale associated with the SRITPR, and the corresponding MODIS and AATSR LST were validated at the 16 ground sites. Results for MODIS and AATSR LST show that the effect of spatial representativeness on the validation results over the sites is large, with mean biases between -1.95 K and 5.60 K and standard deviations between 0.07 K and 3.72 K. Since the TVM method does not rely on a specific satellite or land surface product, it is readily applied to other LST products (e.g. Sentinel-3 SLSTR LST, NOAA VIIRS LST) and surface parameters (e.g. surface longwave radiation).

AB Small (< 25 kg) aerial drones have expanded the remote sensing toolkit for disaster management activities. Here, we provide a critical review of drone-based remote sensing of natural hazard-related disasters to highlight research trends, biases, and expose new opportunities. We performed a systematic literature search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology, resulting in 635 relevant articles from which we derived statistics relating to geography, drone hardware, disaster management application, and drone remote sensing data type and analysis method. Key findings include a bias towards: (i) mass movement hazards (38%); (ii) small (< 1 km(2)) (76%) and rural (79%) study areas in high-income countries and territories (64%); (iii) image-based observations of features from the natural environment (77%); and (iv) support of mitigation-related vulnerability assessment and risk modeling (54%) and environmental recovery (23%). We recommend that future studies focus on: (i) earthquakes, floods, and cyclones and other windstorms due to higher loss of life and economic impacts; (ii) larger and urban study areas in low, lower-middle, and upper-middle income countries and territories to support vulnerable populations; (iii) under-demonstrated (and especially response-related) disaster management activities, which generally require observations of built features from urban environments; and (iv) data standards for integrating drone-based remote sensing with international disaster management methodologies.

AB Estimates of surface reflectance from observed radiance are fundamentally tied to the accuracy of the radiative transfer models used to simulate the interaction of light with the atmosphere and surface. These radiative transfer models are parameterized by a wide range of quantities, ranging from observation and solar geometries to assumptions about atmospheric conditions, including vertical distributions aerosols and water vapor as well as the atmospheric composition. However, current retrieval approaches cannot represent this variability; they are limited by computational expense to a coarsely-spaced look up table (LUT) of just a few parameters. Here, we propose a new method called sRTMnet that facilitates the efficient creation of dense LUT grids that fully capture radiative transfer's inherent nonlinearity. sRTMnet uses a combination of fast, reduced-order radiative transfer modeling coupled with neural-network-based emulation to realize a computational speedup of over 3000x while maintaining the accuracy of a high-fidelity RTM. We demonstrate the accuracy of sRTMnet in multiple ways. We show that neural-network-based emulation delivers accurate atmospheric properties using robust testing sets. We then use acquisitions from the airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer - next generation (AVIRIS-NG) to show near identical surface reflectance estimates with sRTMnet and a high-fidelity radiative transfer model (MODTRAN). Finally, we show how distributions of mapped minerals remain consistent when using the sRTMnet-based reflectance. Given these results, sRTMnet will be utilized for the upcoming Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT, an imaging spectrometer destined for the international space station in 2022). In addition to speed and accuracy, the fully open-source nature of sRTMnet (including simulation and emulation), provides a pathway for high-resolution imaging spectroscopy reflectance retrievals at the global scale.

AB Multiple approaches have been used by the Ocean Colour community for validating satellite-derived products using in situ data, with most of them derived from mainly two approaches, one suggested by Bailey and Werdell (2006) (BW06) and one suggested by Zibordi et al. (2009a) (Z09), each with a different set of quality checking and spatiotemporal collocation criteria. The question remains what sort of information is added or missed when choosing one over the other. In this work, the differences among validation approaches were determined by using a common dataset of in situ and satellite data. The match-up exercise was separated into two groups of datasets based on the spatial resolution of the sensors to be validated. Sentinel-3A/OLCI data were selected as a representation of medium spatial resolution sensors, and two validation approaches were selected to this matchup dataset. The high spatial resolution sensors were represented by Sentinel-2A/MSI data, and three validation approaches were tested. Data from the AERONET-OC network were chosen as the common in situ dataset. For Sentinel-3A/OLCI, the number of match-ups varies depending on the validation approach used. Bailey and Werdell (2006) produces 20% more match-ups for Sentinel-3A/OLCI due to its more relaxed filtering criteria compared to the criteria applied by Zibordi et al. (2009a). The validation metrics vary between different validation methods giving a different impression of accuracy of the satellite products. Also, the satellite data selected by BW06 have a statistical distribution with a higher median and standard deviation when compared to Z09. Similar findings are also confirmed for the match-up analysis conducted for Sentinel-2A/MSI. Therefore, although a common reference dataset was used, the validation statistical results were influenced by the validation approach selected. This does not suggest that one validation protocol is better than the other, but it implies that validation statistics reported in different studies may not always be directly comparable. Additionally, it was determined that BW06 could be a better fit when trying to obtain a sufficient number of matchups for calibration purposes in the shortest time.

AB Accurate tree density and location are important information for optimizing the management and production of forest. Combination of remote sensing techniques and local maximum (LM) filtering algorithm provides a feasible approach to individual tree crown detection, but still faces high error under complicate canopy structure. In this study, a revised LM (RLM) algorithm is presented and evaluated for identifying individual trees from four high spatial-resolution images. Instead of a moving window technique, the RLM algorithm finds crown center seeds by searching local maximal in the transects along row and column directions of the image. Each of final crown centers is then searched using a variable window centered at the crown center seed. Strategies for splitting and merging crowns are implemented in the RLM algorithm to reduce false detection. Result showed that accuracy of the RLM algorithm was more sensitive to its minimum crown length parameter (CLmin). The RLM algorithm driven by the CLmin estimates achieved high overall accuracies between 85% and 91% and low commission (9?14%) and omission errors (8?15%) for the four images. Splitting and merging strategies implemented in the RLM algorithm effectively reduced commission and omission errors. These results indicate that the RLM algorithm is a feasible method with well-defined parameters for automatically detecting individual trees with satisfactory detection accuracy.

AB Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) instruments provide a powerful tool to investigate spatiotemporal variations in regional-scale terrestrial water storage based on the solid Earth's elastic response to hydrologic loading signals. Here, we implemented an independent component analysis-based inversion method to investigate water storage changes and hydrometeorological extremes (e.g., heavy precipitation and droughts) in Yunnan. Our time-varying inversion allows us to reproduce the spatiotemporal evolution of terrestrial water storage changes. Three independent components (ICs) were chosen in our time-varying inversion model. The first two ICs contribute to 96.9% and 2.1% of data variance, respectively, and reveal annual water storage changes at different temporal scales. The third IC slightly explains the network time series and possibly correlates with the nonlinear water changes. The averaged GNSS, Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) based multi-annual seasonal water changes have good consistency in their spatiotemporal signatures. All datasets suggest a gradually increasing trend in seasonal water storage variations from northeast to southwest Yunnan. The peak annual amplitudes of similar to 355 mm in the GNSS-inferred water estimates are larger than those of similar to 167-226 mm derived from the GLDAS and GRACE models. Hydrometeorological extremes are tracked in the various water time series, and GNSS-derived water deficits contribute to hydrological drought characterization. We also find good agreement between daily precipitation anomalies, GNSS-, and GLDAS-based water changes during the 2015 winter rainstorm. Our results demonstrate that a continuously operating GNSS network is a complementary tool to remotely measure terrestrial water storage changes and to provide valuable insights into operational hydrological monitoring.

AB Data collected at large scale and low cost (e.g. satellite and street level imagery) have the potential to substantially improve resolution, spatial coverage, and temporal frequency of measurement of urban inequalities. Multiple types of data from different sources are often available for a given geographic area. Yet, most studies utilize a single type of input data when making measurements due to methodological difficulties in their joint use. We propose two deep learning-based methods for jointly utilizing satellite and street level imagery for measuring urban inequalities. We use London as a case study for three selected outputs, each measured in decile classes: income, overcrowding, and environmental deprivation. We compare the performances of our proposed multimodal models to corresponding unimodal ones using mean absolute error (MAE). First, satellite tiles are appended to street level imagery to enhance predictions at locations where street images are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 20, 10, and 9% in units of decile classes for income, overcrowding, and living environment. The second approach, novel to the best of our knowledge, uses a U-Net architecture to make predictions for all grid cells in a city at high spatial resolution (e.g. for 3 m ? 3 m pixels in London in our experiments). It can utilize city wide availability of satellite images as well as more sparse information from street level images where they are available leading to improvements in accuracy by 6, 10, and 11%. We also show examples of prediction maps from both approaches to visually highlight performance differences.

AB Due to the success of the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) missions, new satellite missions are on the horizon. The current and future missions can benefit from investigations that seek to improve retrieval algorithms that quantitatively map global soil moisture and vegetation optical depth (tau) from Earth's microwave emissions. In this study, we explore multi-angular and multi-frequency approaches for the retrieval of soil moisture and vegetation tau, considering the payload configurations of current and future satellite missions (such as the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer, the Water Cycle Observation Mission, and the Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite) using a new set of ground observations. Two ground-based microwave radiometry datasets collected in Inner Mongolia during the Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River from July to August 2017 (cropland) and August to September 2018 (grassland) are used for this study. The corn field, which covers an entire growth period, indicated that the degree of information increases linearly as the number of channels (in terms of the incidence angle and frequency) increases, and that the multi-frequency observations contain slightly more independent information than do the multi-angular observations under the same number of channels. The polarization difference in brightness temperature is sensitive to both soil moisture and vegetation water content, especially at L-band due to its penetrating ability. Soil moisture explains most of the variance in frequency differences of brightness temperature at adjacent frequencies (L- & C-bands, C- & X-bands), while the variance in incidence-angle differences of brightness temperature is mostly associated with the vegetation water content. A multi-channel collaborative algorithm (MCCA) is developed based on the two-component version of the omega-tau model, which utilizes information from collaborative channels expressed as an analytical form of brightness temperature at the core channel to rule out the parameters to be retrieved. Results of soil moisture retrieval show that the multi-angular approach used by the MCCA generally has a better performance, unbiased mot mean square difference (ubRMSD) varying from 0.028 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.037 cm(3)/cm(3), than the multi-frequency approach (ubRMSD from 0.028 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.089 cm(3)/cm(3)) for the corn field. This is attributed to the dependence of vegetation tau on the frequency being more significant than that on the incidence angle. Except for in the C- & X-band combination, the multi-frequency approach used by the MCCA performs better (ubRMSD from 0.018 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.023 cm(3)/cm(3)) than the multi-angular version (ubRMSD from 0.026 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.034 cm(3)/cm(3)) for the grass field due to reduced vegetation effects for this type of cover. It is affirmed that increasing the number of observation channels could make the soil moisture retrieval more robust, but might also limit the retrieval performance, as the probability that the model estimations will not match the observations is increased. This study provides new insights into the design of potential satellite missions to improve soil moisture retrieval. A satellite with simultaneous multi-angular and multi-frequency observation capabilities is highly recommended.

AB An algorithm for retrieving the fraction of the sea surface covered by whitecaps (W) from Landsat-8 satellite optical reflectance measurements in the near-infrared channel is described. The distribution of W derived from approximately 100 Landsat-8 scenes was compared with quasi-synchronous scatterometer measurements of wind speed (u10), which allowed us to obtain the W(u10) relation for large whitecaps from high-resolution satellite optical measurements. Further, we demonstrate the impact of various phenomena, includinginternal waves, river plumes, bottom topography, atmospheric stability, ocean fronts, and mesoscale currents on whitecap coverage and its spatial variation in different areas of the ocean. These data are analysed using theoretical models, suggesting that whitecap coverage is a proxy of wave energy dissipation and reflects disturbances in the wind-wave energy balance caused by wave-current interactions and variable wind forcing due to changes in atmospheric stratification over ocean temperature fronts and the movement of wind-waves by surface currents relative to the atmospheric boundary layer.

AB The topic of satellite remote sensing of lake ice has gained considerable attention in recent years. Optical satellite data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) allow for the monitoring of lake ice cover (an Essential Climate Variable or ECV), and dates associated with ice phenology (freeze-up, break-up, and ice cover duration) over large areas in an era where ground-based observational networks have nearly vanished in many northern countries. Ice phenology dates as well as dates of maximum and minimum ice cover extent (for lakes that do not form a complete ice cover in winter or do not totally lose their ice cover in summer) are useful for assessing long-term trends and variability in climate, particularly due to their sensitivity to changes in near-surface air temperature. Existing knowledge-driven (threshold-based) retrieval algorithms for lake ice cover mapping that use top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance products do not perform well under lower solar illumination conditions (i.e. large solar zenith angles), resulting in low TOA reflectance. This research assessed the capability of four machine learning classifiers (i.e. multinomial logistic regression, MLR; support vector machine, SVM; random forest, RF; gradient boosting trees, GBT) for mapping lake ice cover, water and cloud cover during both break-up and freeze-up periods using the MODIS/Terra L1B TOA (MOD02) product. The classifiers were trained and validated using samples collected from 17 large lakes across the Northern Hemisphere (Europe and North America); lakes that represent different characteristics with regards to area, latitude, freezing frequency, and ice duration. Following an accuracy assessment using random k-fold cross-validation (k = 100), all machine learning classifiers using a 7-band combination (visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared) were found to be able to produce overall classification accuracies above 94%. Both RF and GBT provided overall and class-specific accuracies above 98% and a more visually accurate depiction of lake ice, water and cloud cover. The two tree-based classifiers offered the most robust spatial transferability over the 17 lakes and performed consistently well across ice seasons. However, only RF was relatively insensitive to the choice of the hyperparameters compared to the other three classifiers. The results demonstrate the potential of RF for mapping lake ice cover globally from MODIS TOA reflectance data.

AB The active hydrodynamics and complex circulation patterns in the northern Gulf of Mexico (nGoM) provide a dynamic scenario to investigate mesoscale responses of the size structure of phytoplankton communities to environmental variability. In this study, a large in-situ dataset acquired in inland, estuarine and coastal waters of the nGoM and U.S. East Coast were utilized to achieve a regional parameterization of the red-NIR ratio-based chlorophyll a (Chl a) algorithm for the high-spatial and spectral resolution Sentinel 3-OLCI ocean color sensor. Using an adaptive scheme, the algorithm was used in combination with other standard Chl a algorithms such as the Neural Network (C2RCC) and OC4ME to optimally extract Chl a in water types ranging from turbid estuarine to clear oceanic waters in the nGoM. This adaptive methodology (Chl a_AD) showed better performance in estimating OLCI-Chl a (R-2=0.84, N = 178) compared to any single algorithm in the estuarine-coastal-ocean waters of the nGoM. Next, OLCI-derived phytoplankton spectral absorption coefficients (OLCI-a(phy)) were obtained for comparison, using a regionally-tuned 3rd order function of OLCI-Chl a based on Multi-regression (MR), and an estuarine-to-ocean adaptive Quasi-Analytical Algorithm (QAA-AD). Finally, an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) algorithm was applied to OLCI-aphy to retrieve phytoplankton size fractions (PSFs) for the river dominated nGoM region. Results indicate relatively better performance of MR-EOF in estimating f(micro) (R-2=0.87), f(nano)(R-2=0.76) and f(pico)(R-2=0.64) compared to QAA-AD-EOF. Chl a time-series (Oct 2016 - Jan 2020) obtained in the estuaries and shelf waters of the nGoM revealed seasonality (peak/lows in spring/fall) linked to river discharge, where hydrodynamics and wind driven variability due to storms further influenced the phytoplankton biomass spatiotemporal distribution. Microphytoplankton dominated in estuaries and the nGOM inner shelf waters, including the midshelf region during the spring peak river discharge period. PSF dynamics in the outer shelf is strongly influenced by Loop Current eddies where warm offshore waters contribute to the dominance of the picophytoplankton fraction. Floodwater discharge and strong winds due to Hurricane Barry (2019) transported estuarine microphytoplankton into the outer shelf and also increased nanophytoplankton fraction. Such fluctuations in phytoplankton size structure after hurricanes or storms can modify the pelagic food web dynamics in coastal systems.

AB Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can significantly harm human health and increase the risk of death. Satellite remote sensing allows for generating spatially continuous PM2.5 data, but current datasets have overall low accuracies with coarse spatial resolutions limited by data sources and models. Air pollution levels in China have experienced dramatic changes over the past couple of decades. However, country-wide ground-based PM2.5 records only date back to 2013. To reveal the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5, long-term and high-spatialresolution aerosol optical depths, generated by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Multi-Angle implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, were employed to estimate PM2.5 concentrations at a 1 km resolution using our proposed Space-Time Extra-Trees (STET) model. Our model can capture well variations in PM2.5 concentrations at different spatiotemporal scales, with higher accuracies (i.e., cross-validation coefficient of determination, CV-R-2 = 0.86-0.90) and stronger predictive powers (i.e., R-2 = 0.80-0.82) than previously reported. The resulting PM2.5 dataset for China (i.e., ChinaHighPM(2.5)) provides the longest record (i.e., 2000 to 2018) at a high spatial resolution of 1 km, enabling the study of PM2.5 variation patterns at different scales. In most places, PM2.5 concentrations showed increasing trends around 2007 and remained high until 2013, after which they declined substantially, thanks to a series of government actions combating air pollution in China. While nationwide PM2.5 concentrations have decreased by 0.89 mu g/m(3)/yr (p < 0.001) during the last two decades, the reduction has accelerated to 4.08 mu g/m(3)/yr (p < 0.001) over the last six years, indicating a significant improvement in air quality. Large improvements occurred in the Pearl and Yangtze River Deltas, while the most polluted region remained the North China Plain, especially in winter. The ChinaHighPM(2.5) dataset will enable more insightful analyses regarding the causes and attribution of pollution over mediumor small-scale areas.

AB Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a remote sensing technology known for its applicability in natural resources management. By quantifying the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and underlying terrain using laser technology, ALS has been used extensively for enhancing geospatial knowledge in the fields of forestry and ecology. Structural descriptions of vegetation provide a means of estimating a range of ecologically pertinent attributes, such as height, volume, and above-ground biomass. The efficient processing of large, often technically complex datasets requires dedicated algorithms and software. The continued promise of ALS as a tool for im-proving ecological understanding is often dependent on user-created tools, methods, and approaches. Due to the proliferation of ALS among academic, governmental, and private-sector communities, paired with requirements to address a growing demand for open and accessible data, the ALS community is recognising the importance of free and open-source software (FOSS) and the importance of user-defined workflows. Herein, we describe the philosophy behind the development of the lidR package. Implemented in the R environment with a C/C++ backend, lidR is free, open-source and cross-platform software created to enable simple and creative processing workflows for forestry and ecology communities using ALS data. We review current algorithms used by the research community, and in doing so raise awareness of current successes and challenges associated with parameterisation and common implementation approaches. Through a detailed description of the package, we address the key considerations and the design philosophy that enables users to implement user-defined tools. We also discuss algorithm choices that make the package representative of the 'state-of-the-art' and we highlight some internal limitations through examples of processing time discrepancies. We conclude that the development of applications like lidR are of fundamental importance for developing transparent, flexible and open ALS tools to ensure not only reproducible workflows, but also to offer researchers the creative space required for the progress and development of the discipline.

AB Thick-cloud contamination causes serious missing data in Landsat images, which substantially limits applications of these images. To remove thick clouds from Landsat data, the most popular methods employ auxiliary data such as a cloud-free image of the same area acquired on another date (referred to as the "reference image"). However, the performance of most previous methods strongly depends on the usefulness of the specific reference image, but in some cases high-quality cloud-free reference images are rarely available. In addition, some of these methods ignore the use of partially cloud-contaminated reference images, but clear pixels in these images can be very useful. To address these issues, a new cloud-removal method (AutoRegression to Remove Clouds (ARRC)) has been developed in this study. The most important improvement of ARRC is that it considers autocorrelation of Landsat time-series data and employs multi-year Landsat images including partially cloud-contaminated images in the cloud-removing process. ARRC also addresses the cases in which autocorrelation of Landsat time series might be adversely affected by abrupt land cover changes over multiple years. We compared ARRC with the widely-used MNSPI (modified neighborhood similar pixel interpolator) method at four challenging sites, including an urban area in Beijing and three croplands, in the North China Plain, northeastern Vietnam, and Iowa, USA. Results from the cloud-simulated images showed that ARRC performed better than MNSPI and achieved lower RMSE values (e.g., 0.02129 vs. 0.03005, 0.03293 vs. 0.04725, 0.02740 vs. 0.03556, and 0.03303 vs. 0.03973 in the near-infrared band at the four testing sites, respectively). Moreover, the experiments demonstrated improved performance when clear pixels in partially cloud-contaminated images were used by ARRC. Furthermore, cloud-free images reconstructed by ARRC were visually better than those reconstructed by MNSPI when both approaches were applied to actual cloud-contaminated Landsat images.

AB Land degradation affects over one-third of the global land area and is projected to become even more widespread due to climate change and land use pressures. Despite being a critical issue for climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and food security, the detection of the onset, duration, and magnitude of land degradation remains challenging, as is early identification of short-term vegetation loss preceding land degradation. Here, we present a new approach for monitoring both short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation in grasslands using satellite data. Our approach integrates Spectral Mixture Analysis and temporal segmentation, and analyzes dense time-series of satellite observations in three steps. First, we unmix all available satellite observations and aggregate them into monthly composites. Second, we calculate the annual Cumulative Endmember Fractions and examine their piecewise trends among years to determine the onset, duration, and magnitude of short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation. Third, we attribute a decrease in the green vegetation fraction with a concomitant increase in either open soil, or non-photosynthetic vegetation. We tested our method mapping short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation in grasslands in the Caucasus Ecoregion using the 2001-2018 time series of MODIS 8-day reflectance data. We found strong patterns of short-term vegetation loss and decadal degradation, mostly in the eastern part of the Caucasus Ecoregion in areas of desert and semi-desert natural vegetation. Short-term vegetation loss episodes (3-9 years) were more common and had greater magnitude than decadal degradation (>= 10 years), especially in steppe regions. On average, 9.3% of grassland area was subjected annually to either decadal, or short-term vegetation loss. Desiccation, i.e., the shift from green vegetation to dry vegetation, was the most prevalent type of change pathway, with green vegetation loss to open soil coming second. Decadal degradation and short-term vegetation loss rates were the highest in dry areas where the potential natural vegetation is sub-shrub deserts, or halophytic, alluvial, and wet lowland forests. Our findings support known general degradation patterns in the Caucasus Ecoregion, but provide better understanding of ongoing processes, by detecting exact location, timing, and magnitude of changes. More broadly, our method advances the monitoring of grasslands by detecting both decadal degradation and shortterm vegetation loss. This flexibility supports adaptive degradation monitoring, aids sustainable land management, and provides new information for carbon stock analyses and biodiversity conservation.

AB Precipitable water vapor (PWV) is among the key variables in the water and energy cycles, whereas current PWV products are limited by spatiotemporal discontinuity, low accuracy, and/or coarse spatial resolution. Based on two widely used global PWV products, i.e., satellite-based MODIS and reanalysis-based ERA5 products, here we propose a data fusion approach to generate PWV maps of spatiotemporal continuity and high resolution (0.01 degrees, daily) for the Upper Brahmaputra River (UBR, referred to as the Yarlung Zangbo River in China) basin in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during the monsoon period (May - September) from 2007 to 2013. Results show that the fused PWV estimates have good agreement with PWV estimates from nine GPS stations (i.e., correlation coefficient: 0.87-0.97, overall bias: -0.4-1.8 mm, and root-mean-square error: 1.1-2.0 mm), greatly improving the accuracy of the MODIS PWV product. The fused PWV maps of high spatial resolution provide detailed and reasonable spatial variations which are generally consistent with those from the MODIS estimates under confident clear conditions and ERA5. Mean monthly PWV estimates across the UBR basin vary from similar to 6 to similar to 12 mm during the study period, and for each month high PWV values are found along the UBR valley and at the basin outlet. The developed data fusion approach maximizes the potential of satellite and reanalysis-based PWV products for retrieving PWV and has the potential to be applied to other high-mountain regions. The generated PWV estimates for the UBR basin are valuable in understanding the water and energy cycles and in retrieving atmospheric and surface variables for the southern TP including the Himalaya.

AB The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.3.2 of the United Nations (UN) focuses on ambient water quality, while water clarity simplistically and visually reflect water quality and can potentially support SDG 6.3.2 reporting. In this study, based on extensive field data and Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) imagery, a random forest regression (RFR) Secchi depth (Z(sd)) model suitable for turbid and eutrophic waters was established. With this model, the Zsd of 86 large (> 30 km(2)) lakes in Eastern China was obtained from May 2016 to April 2018. Additionally, the potential for applying OLCI-derived Z(sd) data in the SDG 6.3.2 evaluation was assessed. Of six common atmospheric correction (AC) processors (i.e., BAC, C2RCC, POLYMER, BP, MUMM, and 6SV), 6SV often exhibited the best performance except for at 754 nm (root mean square error (RMSE) <= 0.0094 sr(-1), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) <= 36.27%, and mean normalized bias (MNB) <= 15.89%). The RFR model had higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 0.13 m, MAPE = 33.43%, and MNB = 14.55%) and was more suitable for eutrophic and turbid inland lakes across Eastern China than the other available Z(sd) algorithms. The average OLCI-derived Z(sd) of the lakes in Eastern China was 0.44 +/- 0.13 m, suggesting that these lakes are extremely turbid. The average Zsd of lakes in the Eastern Plain Lake (EPL) zone (0.45 +/- 0.12 m) was higher than that of the lakes in the Northeastern Plain and Mountain Lake (NPML) zone (0.40 +/- 0.17 m). The majority of lakes showed higher Z(sd) values in summer (rainy season) than in fall and winter (dry season). A simple SDG 6.3.2 evaluation scheme was developed based on the Zsd product, and only 54.65% of the lakes (N = 47) reached the "good" level during the monitoring period as a result of the eutrophication of the lakes in Eastern China. This study provides water clarity information for large lakes in Eastern China and facilitates the understanding of ambient water quality under the 2030 UN SDG framework as well as data and technical support for future SDG 6.3.2 evaluations.

AB Fire severity is a function of dynamic interactions between vegetation and burning conditions. To understand the factors that control it, accurate methods for estimating prefire vegetation structure and composition as well as fire propagation conditions are required. Here we analyzed the spatial variability of fire severity in a mixed-severity fire (3217 ha) that occurred in southeast Spain (Yeste, Albacete) from 27th July to 1th August 2017, burning mostly a pine woodland, including part of an earlier fire in 1994. Fire severity was estimated using three satellite-based indices derived from the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) using Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images from the dates before and immediately after fire. The field-based Composite Burn Index (CBI) was used for validation. Prefire vegetation conditions and fuel models were derived from LiDAR metrics and other vegetation data. Fire propagation conditions were estimated based on a fire progression map provided by the Forestry Services of Castilla-La Mancha. In addition, hourly fire weather and aligned (i.e., in the sense of the propagating fire-front) slope and wind speed were calculated for each burning period. Regression models using different spectral fire severity indices and their driving factors were obtained applying Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs). Fire severity was highly predicted by both burning conditions and prefire vegetation (mean adjusted R-2 [Adj.R-2]: 86% +/- 0.04 and 68% +/- 0.05 for training and validation sets, respectively). Alone, burning conditions explained more variance than LiDAR metrics and vegetation separately. The single variables that contributed most to the models were the rate of spread of the fire-front, biomass proxies (i.e., Leaf Area Index [LAI] and fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation [fPAR]) and understory vegetation (i.e., density of LiDAR points 1-2 m). Higher fire severity occurred in areas burning uphill, with a high rate of spread driven by high velocity winds and under high maximum temperature. Fire severity was high in wooded stands that were heterogeneous in height, composed by scattered and small Pinus halepensis trees, with high and homogeneous understory cover. In contrast, lower fire severity occurred in mature stands dominated by tall Pinus pinaster and Pinus nigra trees. There were strong interactions between vegetation, weather, fire-aligned topography and rate of spread. Because vegetation variables were important drivers of fire severity, even under extreme fire weather conditions, fuel management treatments to limit fire severity and, potentially, fire size should be implemented.

AB The increasing impact of humans on land and ongoing global population growth requires an improved understanding of land cover (LC) and land use (LU) processes related to settlements. The heterogeneity of built-up areas and infrastructures as well as the importance of not only mapping, but also characterizing anthropogenic structures suggests using a sub-pixel mapping approach for analysing related LC from space. We implement a regression-based unmixing approach for mapping built-up surfaces and infrastructure, woody vegetation and non-woody vegetation for all of Germany and Austria at 10 m resolution to demonstrate the potential of sub-pixel mapping. We map LC fractions for one point in time, using all available Sentinel-2 data from 2017 and 2018 (< 70% cloud cover). We combine the concept of synthetically mixed training data with statistical aggregations from spectral-temporal metrics (STM) derived from Sentinel-2 reflectance time series. We specifically examine how STM can be used for creating synthetically mixed training data. STM are known to facilitate large area mapping by being largely independent of image acquisition dates and inherently incorporate phenological information. Vegetation is an important part of settlements and time series information supports its mapping. Synthetically mixed training data facilitates a streamlined training by using pure reference spectra to generate artificial mixtures as input to regression modelling of LC fractions in mixed pixels. We here show how combining both offers great potential for wall-to-wall LC fraction mapping. We further investigate the positive effect of STM on map results by comparing the performance of different subsets of STM combinations. Our results indicate that many STM combinations containing spectral variability and vegetation indices provide suitable input to creating synthetic training data for regression-based fraction mapping. Results for built-up surfaces and infrastructure (MAE 0.13/RMSE 0.18 at 20 m resolution), woody vegetation (0.18, 0.22) and non-woody vegetation (0.14, 0.19) are highly consistent across Germany and Austria. Only a few surface types were not accurately predicted in our nation-wide mapping. Further research is required to optimize mapping of temporally invariant bare soil and rock surfaces that show spectral similarity to built-up surfaces and infrastructure. The proposed methodology combines benefits of both regression-based modelling with synthetically mixed training data and STM, and thus facilitates mapping of LC fractions on a national scale and at high resolution. Such information will allow to better characterize settlements and identifying processes such as densification that are best represented by continuous LC mapping.

AB The ability to map fire severity is a requirement for fire management agencies worldwide. The development of repeatable methods to produce accurate and consistent fire severity maps from satellite imagery is necessary to document fire regimes, to set priorities for post-fire management responses, and for research applications. Machine learning techniques, such as random forest, have shown great promise for mapping of wildfire severity in woodland and forest ecosystems using satellite imagery. However, an assessment of the properties of training data required for automated mapping with random forest is currently lacking. This study examined how training data properties affect fire severity classification across forest, woodland and shrubland communities of southern Australia. The aims of this study were: (i) to examine how sample size (i.e. number of training points and fire events) and sample imbalance affect classification accuracy; (ii) to determine whether models were transferrable across geographic regions; and (iii) to assess the need for classifiers for prescribed burns and wildfires. We sampled 33 wildfires and 57 prescribed burns occurring across southern Australia between 2006 and 2019, to derive an extensive dataset (n = 25, 350 points) suitable for model training and validation. Five fire severity classes were mapped across the forest, woodland and shrubland communities. Using independent spatial cross validation of wildfires, we found that a minimum of 300 sample points per severity class, sampled across at least ten independent fires, was sufficient to reach the upper threshold of classification accuracy for the five severity classes. Training datasets derived across broad environmental space or close (<= 100 km) to the target fire (i.e. fire to be mapped) produced better predictions than those derived regionally and far (> 100 km) from the target fire. Models trained on data derived from both wildfires and prescribed burns had similar overall accuracy as those trained only on data from the fire type being predicted. However, there were significant differences in accuracy between the models trained with wildfires, prescribed burns and combined datasets within some severity classes. The random forest classifier had an overall accuracy of similar to 88% for wildfires and similar to 68% for prescribed burns across the study fires. The discrepancy in accuracy between wildfires and burns was likely due to the poorer classification performance for low fire severity classes, the dominant severity classes in prescribed burns. Overall classification accuracy was relatively consistent across forest, woodland and shrubland communities within the study fires, indicating that the method is robust across the temperate forest biome of southern Australia. Our results demonstrate that consideration of training data properties, specifically the number of points and fires sampled, sample balance and the geographic source of sample data, will be important considerations for the automated mapping of fire severity using random forest classification and Landsat imagery.

AB Polar ocean ecosystems are experiencing rapid environmental change, but measuring the associated phyto-plankton responses is challenging using traditional satellite passive ocean color measurements due to signal contamination from clouds and sea ices and to low solar elevation angles. Active satellite lidar measurements allow retrieval of ocean phytoplankton properties under conditions prohibitive to passive ocean color sensors. The ICESat-2 satellite lidar measurements provide two-dimensional distributions of upper ocean phytoplankton properties. The spring phytoplankton blooms extending about 230 km horizontally from dense packs ice near Antarctic marginal ice zones and 15 m vertically below ocean surface are observed from space for the first time. Our findings highlight the advantages of satellite lidar technology for understanding high latitude plankton ecology and biogeochemistry.

AB Interannual variability (IAV) in ecosystem productivity may reveal vulnerabilities of vegetation to climate stressors. We analyzed IAV of northern hemisphere ecosystems using several remote sensing datasets, including longstanding observations of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and more novel metrics for productivity including solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv). Although previous studies have suggested SIF better tracks variations in ecosystem productivity at seasonal timescales, we found that satellite datasets (including SIF) and eddy covariance flux tower observations were subject to significant uncertainty when assessing IAV at fine spatial scales. Even when observations were aggregated regionally, IAV in productivity estimated by the various satellite products were not always well correlated. In response to these inconsistencies, we applied a statistical method on regionally aggregated productivity data in four selected North American ecoregions and identified two dominant modes of IAV-seasonal redistribution and amplification-that were consistent across satellite datasets. The seasonal redistribution mode, which played a stronger role at lower latitudes, associated high (low) spring productivity with warm (cold) spring and summer temperatures, but also with lower (higher) productivity and water availability in summer and fall, indicating that enhanced growth in spring may contribute to an earlier depletion of water resources. The amplification mode associated an increase (decrease) in productivity across the growing season with above-average (below-average) summer moisture conditions. Even though our statistical analysis at large spatial scales revealed meaningful links between terrestrial productivity and climate drivers, our analysis does suggest that IAV and long-term trends in presently available novel and more established satellite observations must be interpreted cautiously, with careful attention to the spatial scales at which a robust signal emerges.

AB Invasive Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora), a native riparian species in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, has led to serious degradation to the ecosystem and biodiversity as well as economic losses since it was introduced to China in 1979. Although multi-temporal remote sensing offers unique capability to monitor S. alterniflora over large areas and long time periods, three major hurdle exist: (1) in the coastal zone where S. alterniflora occupies, frequent cloud coverage reduces the number of available images that can be used; (2) prominent spectral variations exist within the S. alterniflora due to phonological variations; (3) poor spectral separability between S. alterniflora and its co-dominant native species is often presented in the territories where S. alterniflora intruded in. To articulate these questions, we proposed a new pixel-based phenological feature composite method (PpfCM) based on Google Earth Engine. The Ppf-CM method was brainstormed to battle the aforementioned three hurdles as the basic unit for extracting phonological feature is individual pixel in lieu of an entire image scene. With the Ppf-CM-derived phenological feature as inputs, we took a step further to investigate the performance of the latest deep learning method as opposed to that of the conventional support vector machine (SVM); Lastly, we strive to understand how S. alterniflora has changed its spatial distribution in the Beibu Gulf of China from 1995 to 2017. As a result, we found (1) the developed Ppf-CM method can mitigate the phonological variation and augment the spectral separability between S. alterniflora and the background species regardless of the significant cloud coverage in the study area; (2) deep learning, compared to SVM, presented better potentials for incorporating the new phenological features generated from the Ppf-CM method; and (3) for the first time, we discovered a S. alterniflora invasion outbreak occurred during 1996-2001.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors represent an indispensable data source for flood disaster planners and responders, given their ability to image the Earth's surface nearly independently of weather conditions and time of day. The decision by the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus program to open data from its Sentinel-1 SAR satellites to the public marks the first time global, operational SAR data have been made freely available. Combined with the emergence of cloud computing platforms like the Google Earth Engine (GEE), this development presents a tremendous opportunity to the disaster response community, for whom rapid access to analysis-ready data is needed to inform effective flood disaster response interventions and management plans. Here, we present an algorithm that exploits all available Sentinel-1 SAR images in combination with historical Landsat and other auxiliary data sources hosted on the GEE to rapidly map surface inundation during flood events. Our algorithm relies on multi-temporal SAR statistics to identify unexpected floods in near real-time. Additionally, historical Landsat-based surface water class probabilities are used to distinguish unexpected floods from permanent or seasonally occurring surface water. We assessed our algorithm over three recent flood events using coincident very high- spatial resolution imagery and operational flood maps. Using very high resolution optical imagery, we estimated an area-normalized accuracy of 89.8 +/- 2.8% (95% c.i.) over Houston, Texas following Hurricane Harvey in late August 2017, representing an improvement of between 1.6% and 9.8% over flood maps derived from a simple backscatter threshold. Additionally, comparison of our results with SAR-derived Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) maps following devastating floods in Thessaly, Greece and Eastern Madagascar in January and March 2018, respectively, yielded overall agreement rates of 98.5% in both cases. Importantly, our algorithm was able to ingest hundreds of SAR and optical images served on the GEE to produce flood maps over affected areas within minutes, circumventing the need for time-consuming data download and pre-processing steps. The flexibility of our algorithm will allow for the rapid processing of future open-access SAR data, including data from future Sentinel-1 missions.

AB A new algorithm called combined constrained multi-channel algorithm (C-CMCA) is presented for simultaneous retrieval of soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (VOD) in L-band with improved resolution. Unlike widely used algorithms, the new approach optimally fuses multiple sources of surface temperatures into the inversion process and confines the retrievals to their feasible climatological range rather than the mean and paves the way to account for the slow changes of VOD through a Sobolev-norm regularization. Through controlled numerical experiments that assume a random error in the surface temperatures, it is shown that the algorithm can decrease the root mean squared error (RMSE) by 78% and 81% when compared with the unconstrained version and 54% and 7% when a single source of surface temperature is used in retrievals of SM and VOD, respectively. The use of the Sobolev-norm regularization decreases the RMSE by more than 25% at the expense of a negligible bias. Implementation of the algorithm, using data from the NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite in 2016, demonstrates that the monthly RMSE of SM retrievals improves by more than 6% when compared with the SMAP enhanced products considering the ground measurements from the International SM Network (ISMN) as a reference while the monthly RMSE of VOD decreases by more than 62% when compared with the VOD climatology used in the SMAP SCA products. Analysis of the results demonstrates that, without increasing the native resolution of radiometric observations, the information content of the a priori constraints cannot only improve resolutions of the retrievals but also make them robust to the background water contamination in the vicinity of coastal zones and over lowland floodplains. For example, over Florida peninsula, the annual SM RMSE and bias are reduced by more than 65%.

AB Mangroves globally provide a diverse array of ecosystem services but these are impacted upon by both natural and anthropogenic drivers of change. In Australia, mangroves are protected by law and hence the natural drivers predominate. To determine annual national level changes in mangroves between 1987 and 2016, their extent (by canopy cover type) and dynamics were quantified using dense time-series (nominally every 16 days cloud permitting) of 25 m spatial resolution Landsat sensor data available within Digital Earth Australia (DEA). The potential area that mangroves occupied over this period was established as the union of mangrove maps generated for 1996, 2007-2010 and 2015/16 through the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW). Within this area, the green vegetation fractional cover (GVpc) was retrieved from each available cloud-masked Landsat scene through linear spectral unmixing. The 10th percentile (GVpc10) was then determined for each calendar year by comparing these data in a time-series. The percentage Planimetric Canopy Cover (PCC%) for each Landsat pixel was then estimated using a relationship between GVpc10 and LiDAR-derived PCC% (<1 m resolution and based on acquisitions from all states supporting mangroves, excluding Victoria). The resulting annual maps of mangrove extent and cover for Australia are the first to be generated at a continental scale and on an annual basis. These indicated that the total area of mangrove forest (canopy cover >20%; resolvable at the Landsat resolution) varied from a minima of 10,715 +/- 36 km(2) (95% confidence interval) in 1992 to a maxima of 11,388 km(2) +/- 38 km(2) (95% CI) in 2010, declining to 11,142 +/- 57 km(2) (95% CI) in 2017. In 2010 (maximum extent), the forests were classified as closed canopy (38.8%), open canopy (49.0%) and woodland mangrove (12.2%). The majority of change occurred along the northern Australian coastline and was concentrated in the major gulfs and sounds. The 30 national maps of annual mangrove extent represent a reference dataset, which is publicly available through the Terrestrial Environment Research Network (TERN) landscapes portal. Future efforts are focusing on the routine production of annual mangrove maps beyond 2019 as part of Australia's efforts to monitor the coastal environment.

AB A physically based metamodel is proposed to describe the dependency of canopy reflectance on the wavelength, leaf and soil optical properties. The four-stream solution is first applied to describe the interaction between the soil background and the vegetation layers. This leads to the calibration of four terms for a given canopy structure, observation configuration and leaf properties. This number can be reduced to two terms by using a linear approximation which shows a slight degradation when the multiple scattering contribution is significant. The dependency of each of the two or four terms on wavelength and leaf properties is described using the leaf total absorption coefficient. Our approach requires only 12 (linear approximation) to 24 (four-stream solution) simulations of a reference model to describe the full canopy reflectance dependency on wavelength, leaf and soil properties. The approach was evaluated against reference canopy reflectance simulations using the ray tracing LuxCoreRender model. LuxCoreRender was first compared against reference radiative transfer models. The reference dataset corresponds to a range of detailed 3D maize canopies showing variation of leaf and background properties and one heterogeneous scene including vegetation elements of different shapes that is classically used for model inter-comparison exercises under different view and sun directions in a set of wavebands. Results demonstrate that our approach provides an accurate description of the dependency of canopy reflectance on wavelength, leaf and soil properties with RMSE = 0.0017 for the four-stream solution and RMSE = 0.0022 for the linear approximation. The proposed approach appears therefore computationally effective and well suited to generate a large number of canopy reflectance simulations with detailed 3D radiative transfer models that can be used to retrieve vegetation characteristics from remote sensing observations.

AB Models of atmospheric composition rely on fire emissions inventories to reconstruct and project impacts of biomass burning on air quality, public health, climate, ecosystem dynamics, and land-atmosphere exchanges. Many such global inventories use satellite measurements of active fires and/or burned area from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). However, differences across inventories in the interpretation of satellite imagery, the emissions factors assumed for different components of smoke, and the adjustments made for small and obscured fires can result in large regional differences in fire emissions estimates across inventories. Using Google Earth Engine, we leverage 15 years (2003-2017) of MODIS observations and 6 years (2012-2017) of observations from the higher spatial resolution Visible Imaging Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor to develop metrics to quantify five major sources of spatial bias or uncertainty in the inventories: (1) primary reliance on active fires versus burned area, (2) cloud/haze burden on the ability of satellites to "see" fires, (3) fragmentation of burned area, (4) roughness in topography, and (5) small fires, which are challenging to detect. Based on all these uncertainties, we devise comprehensive "relative fire confidence scores," mapped globally at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees spatial resolution over 2003-2017.
   We then focus on fire activity in Indonesia as a case study to analyze how the choice of a fire emissions inventory affects model estimates of smoke-induced health impacts across Equatorial Asia. We use the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and apply emissions of particulate organic carbon and black carbon (OC + BC smoke) from five global inventories: Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv4s), Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINNv1.5), Global Fire Assimilation System (GFASv1.2), Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFEDv2.5r1), and Fire Energetics and Emissions Research (FEERv1.0-G1.2). We find that modeled monthly smoke PM2.5 in Singapore from 2003 to 2016 correlates with observed smoke PM2.5, with r ranging from 0.64-0.84 depending on the inventory. However, during the burning season (July to October) of high fire intensity years (e.g., 2006 and 2015), the magnitude of mean Jul-Oct modeled smoke PM2.5 can differ across inventories by > 20 mu g m(-3) (> 500%). Using the relative fire confidence metrics, we deduce that uncertainties in this region arise primarily from the small, fragmented fire landscape and very poor satellite observing conditions due to clouds and thick haze at this time of year. Indeed, we find that modeled smoke PM2.5 using GFASv1.2, which adjusts for fires obscured by clouds and thick haze and accounts for peatland emissions, is most consistent with observations in Singapore, as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia. Finally, we develop an online app called FIRECAM for end-users of global fire emissions inventories. The app diagnoses differences in emissions among the five inventories and gauges the relative uncertainty associated with satellite-observed fires on a regional basis.

AB Lakes and glaciers are widely distributed in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau. A synchronized examination of lake and glacier mass variations there has not previously been conducted, which has limited the understanding of the lake water balance and the hydrologic cycle in the region. In this study, we comprehensively examine lake area and volume, and glacier mass changes using multi-sensor satellite data. We find that lake expansion in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau was more robust from 1976 to 2018 when compared to other regions of the plateau, especially for the glacier-fed and endorheic lakes. Lake volume changes show that most of the lakes had an increase in water volume, particularly in 20002018 with a total water storage gain of similar to 28.6 Gt. By using high-resolution KH-9 and TanDEM-X data, we observe that the glacier surface elevation of the western Kunlun Mountains had a slight thinning rate of -0.07 +/- 0.16 m/yr in 1973-2000, but a positive rate of 0.002 +/- 0.003 m/yr in 2000-2018. The heterogeneous pattern of glacier elevation changes between the north (N) and south (S) slopes are revealed, i.e. -0.02 +/- 0.01 m/yr (N) against -0.12 +/- 0.03 m/yr (S) in 1973-2000 and - 0.05 +/- 0.02 m/yr (N) against 0.06 +/- 0.02 m/yr (S) in 2000-2018. Overall, the glaciers trend to a stable state (similar to 0.05 m/yr) in both the south slope of the western Kunlun Mountains and Aru Co regions between 2000 and 2018. Similar patterns are also found for basin-wide examinations of lake storage changes (mass gains) and glacier mass budgets (positive or close to stable). The seasonal snow cover area changes, derived from cloud-free MODIS snow cover products, present a variable and insignificant trend between 2003 and 2017. Snow depth derived from passive microwave remote-sensing data, exhibits a decreasing trend between 1979 and 2015, but the water equivalent could contribute only an insignificant amount to the observed lake changes. The lake water gains, and almost positive glacier mass balance imply that the hydrological cycle in the northwestern Tibetan Plateau has become enhanced.

AB The thermal environment limits species ranges through its influence on physiology and resource distributions and thus affects species richness patterns over broad spatial scales. Understanding how temperature drives species richness patterns is particularly important in the context of global change and for effective conservation planning. Landsat 8's Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) allows direct mapping of temperature at moderate spatial resolutions (100 m, downscaled by the USGS to 30 m), overcoming limitations inherent in coarse interpolated weather station data that poorly capture fine-scale temperature patterns over broad areas. TIRS data thus offer the unique opportunity to understand how the thermal environment influences species richness patterns. Our aim was to develop and assess the ability of TIRS-based temperature metrics to predict patterns of winter bird richness across the conterminous United States during winter, a period of marked temperature stress for birds. We used TIRS data from 2013-2018 to derive metrics of relative temperature and intra-seasonal thermal heterogeneity. To quantify winter bird richness across the conterminous US, we tabulated the richness only for resident bird species, i.e., those species that do not move between the winter and breeding seasons, from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, the most extensive survey of birds in the US. We expected that relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity would have strong positive associations with winter bird richness because colder temperatures heighten temperature stress for birds, and thermal heterogeneity is a proxy for thermal niches and potential thermal refugia that can support more species. We further expected that both the strength of the effects and the relative importance of these variables would be greater for species with greater climate sensitivity, such as small-bodied species and climate-threatened species (i.e., those with large discrepancies between their current and future distributions following projected climate change). Consistent with our predictions, relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity strongly positively influenced winter bird richness patterns, with statistical models explaining 37.3% of the variance in resident bird richness. Thermal heterogeneity was the strongest predictor of small-bodied and climate-threatened species in our models, whereas relative temperature was the strongest predictor of large-bodied and climate-stable species. Our results demonstrate the important role that the thermal environment plays in governing winter bird richness patterns and highlight the previously underappreciated role that intra-seasonal thermal heterogeneity may have in supporting high winter bird species richness. Our findings thus illustrate the exciting potential for TIRS data to guide conservation planning in an era of global change.

AB Information on Earth's land surface and change over time has never been easier to obtain, but making informed decisions to manage land well necessitates that this information is accurate and precise. In recent years, due largely to the inevitability of classification errors in remote sensing-based maps and the marked effects of these errors on subsequent area estimates, sample-based area estimates of land cover and land change have increased in importance and use. Area estimation of land cover and change by sampling is often made more efficient by a priori knowledge of the study area to be analyzed (e.g., stratification). Satellite data, obtained free of cost for virtually all of Earth's land surface, provide an excellent source for constructing landscape stratifications in the form of maps. Errors of omission, defined as sample units observed as land change but mapped as a stable class, may introduce considerable uncertainty in parameter estimates obtained from the sample data (e.g., area estimates of land change). The effects of omission errors are exacerbated in situations where the area of intact forest is large relative to the area of forest change, a common situation in countries that seek results-based payments for reductions in deforestation and associated carbon emissions. The presence of omission errors in such situations can preclude the acquisition of statistically valid evidence of a reduction in deforestation, and thus prevent payments. International donors and countries concerned with mitigating the effects of climate change are looking for guidance on how to reduce the effects of omission errors on area estimates of land change. This article presents the underlying reasons for the effects of omission errors on area estimates, case studies highlighting real-world examples of these effects, and proposes potential solutions. Practicable approaches to efficiently splitting large stable strata are presented that may reduce the effects of omission errors and immediately improve the quality of estimates. However, more research is needed before further recommendations can be provided on how to contain, mitigate and potentially eliminate the effects of omissions errors.

AB Machine learning techniques have been frequently applied to map urban deprivation (commonly referred to as slums) in very high-resolution satellite images. Among these, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have shown exceptional efficiency in automated deprivation mapping at the local scale. Yet these networks have never been used to map very small heterogeneous deprivation areas (pockets) at large scale. This study proposes and evaluates a U-Net-Compound model to map deprivation pockets in Bangalore, India. The model only relies on RGB satellite images with a resolution of 2 m as these are more commonly accessible to local urban planning departments. The experiment assumes a practical situation where only limited reference data is available for the model to learn the spatial morphology of deprivation pockets. It tests whether an updated map of deprivation pockets can be obtained with limited information. The model performance to map a large number of deprivation pockets is examined by incrementally changing the model architecture and the amount of training data. Results show that the proposed model is sensitive to the amount of spatial information contained in the training data. Once sufficient spatial information is learnt through a few samples, the city scale mapping accuracy outperforms existing models in mapping small deprivation pockets, achieving a Jaccard Index of 54%. This study demonstrated that a well-designed convolutional neural network can map the existence, extent, as well as distribution patterns of deprivation pockets at the city scale with limited training data, which is essential for upscaling research outputs to provide important information for the formulation of pro-poor policies.

AB This paper presents a burned area mapping algorithm based on change detection of Sentinel-1 backscatter data guided by thermal anomalies. The algorithm self-adapts to the local scattering conditions and it is robust to variations of input data availability. The algorithm applies the Reed-Xiaoli detector (RXD) to distinguish anomalous changes of the backscatter coefficient. Such changes are linked to fire events, which are derived from thermal anomalies (hotspots) acquired during the detection period by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors. Land cover maps were used to account for changing backscatter behaviour as the RXD is class dependent. A machine learning classifier (random forests) was used to detect burned areas where hotspots were not available. Burned area perimeters derived from optical images (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) were used to validate the algorithm results. The validation dataset covers 21 million hectares in 18 locations that represent the main biomes affected by fires, from boreal forests to tropical and sub-tropical forests and savannas. A mean Dice coefficient (DC) over all studied locations of 0.59 +/- 0.06 (+/- confidence interval, 95%) was obtained. Mean omission (OE) and commission errors (CE) were 0.43 +/- 0.08 and 0.37 +/- 0.06, respectively. Comparing results with the MODIS based MCD64A1 Version 6, our detections are quite promising, improving on average DC by 0.13 and reducing OE and CE by 0.12 and 0.06, respectively.

AB Accurate estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests are critical for supporting strategies of ecosystem functioning conservation and climate change mitigation. However, such estimates at regional and local scales are still highly uncertain. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can characterize the structural and functional diversity of forests with high accuracy at a sub-meter resolution, and potentially improve the AGB estimations. In this study, we compared the ability of different data sources (airborne LiDAR and HSI, and their combination) and regression methods (linear model - LM, linear model with ridge regularization - LMR, Support Vector Regression - SVR, Random Forest - RF, Stochastic Gradient Boosting - SGB, and Cubist - CB) to improve AGB predictions in the Brazilian Amazon. We used georeferenced inventory data from 132 sample plots to obtain a reference field AGB and calculated 333 metrics (45 from LiDAR and 288 from HSI) that could be used as predictors for statistical AGB models. We submitted the metrics to a correlation filtering followed by a feature selection procedure (recursive feature elimination) to optimize the performance of the models and to reduce their complexity. Results showed that both LiDAR and HSI data used alone provided relatively high accurate models if adequate metrics and algorithms are chosen (RMSE = 67.6 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE% = 36%, R-2 = 0.58, for the best LiDAR model; RMSE = 68.1 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE % = 36%, R-2 = 0.58, for the best HSI model). However, HSI-only models required more metrics (5-12) than LiDAR-only models (2-5). Models combining metrics from both datasets resulted in more accurate AGB estimates, regardless of the regression method (RMSE = 57.7 Mg.ha(-1) RMSE% = 31%, R-2 = 0.70, for the best model). The most important LiDAR metrics for estimating AGB were related to the upper canopy cover and tree height percentiles, while the most important HSI metrics were associated with the near infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions, particularly the leaf/canopy water and lignin-cellulose absorption bands. Finally, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the remote sensing data source (LiDAR, HSI, or their combination) had a greater effect size than the regression algorithms. Thus, no single algorithm outperformed the others, although the LM method was less suitable when applied to the HSI and hybrid datasets. Results show that the synergistic use of LiDAR and hyperspectral data has great potential for improving the accuracy of the biomass estimates in the Brazilian Amazon.

AB China aims to end absolute poverty by 2020. In pursuit of this goal, a series of poverty reduction policies and measures have been proposed. As a vital element of poverty reduction, land use in China's poverty-stricken areas also undergone great changes accordingly. However, the land use change patterns in these areas are not well understood. It's necessary to analyze the spatial-temporal land use change patterns to provide data that support poverty alleviation programs. In this study, we proposed a framework for mapping annual land use changes in China's poverty-stricken areas from 2013 to 2018. The Landsat 8 surface reflectance datasets from 2013 to 2018 (available on Google Earth Engine) were utilized to detect the changes in arable land, built-up land, water, vegetation, and un-used land. The land use transition matrix was computed to describe characteristics of the transition, and a Bayesian hierarchical model was employed to investigate the spatial-temporal land use change patterns. Our results demonstrated that the arable land continuously decreased over the study period, while built-up land and vegetation gradually expanded. The primary land use transition occurred between the arable land and vegetation. The local trends of each county indicated obvious regional differences of land use change. Moreover, significant differences existed between deep poverty-stricken counties and normal poverty-stricken counties on arable land and built-up land change, indicating that more intense human construction activities in normal poverty-stricken areas. The annual land use mapping results generated for poverty-stricken areas, along with further analysis of overall temporal change and local change trends, could provide a better understanding of land use changes and regional differences in China's poverty-stricken areas and promote the poverty reduction and sustainable development in those areas.

AB Three-dimensional (3-D) fault geometry and surface slip are key factors for understanding fault behaviour and earthquake mechanics. Previous studies of the 2008 Yutian earthquake occurred on the northwestern Tibetan Plateau, and are limited by a lack of detailed measurements of fault structures and near-fault motion due to the inaccessibility and extreme weather of the area and severe decorrelation of InSAR. In this paper, we use a very high resolution (VHR) DEM of the 2008 rupture zone extracted from the Pleiades satellite stereo imagery to measure the 3-D fault geometry and on-fault slip. The maximum vertical and horizontal coseismic displacement is 3.6 m and 2.8 m respectively. Despite the overall normal faulting, near-fault reverse vertical motion was observed, ranging from 0.5 m to 1.9 m, caused by the transformation of strike-slip motion into localised shortening due to local fault geometric variations. Measurements of the near-surface dip for the three fault segments (55 degrees, 62 degrees, and 58 degrees) show good consistency, different from previous studies (43 degrees, 60 degrees, and 52 degrees). Joint inversion of InSAR and the near-fault measurements of surface slip also show that the fault geometry does not change much along strike. The local ratio of the cumulative to the coseismic vertical offset recorded on an old alluvial fan and an ice tongue ranges from 1.86 to 2.79, suggesting at least 1-2 historical events occurred here before the 2008 earthquake.

AB Maps of classified surface features are a key output from remote sensing. Conventional methods of pixel-based classification label each pixel independently by considering only a pixel's spectral properties. While these purely spectral-based techniques may be applicable to many medium and coarse-scale remote sensing analyses, they may become less appropriate when applied to high spatial resolution imagery in which the pixels are smaller than the objects to be classified. At this scale, there is often higher intra-class spectral heterogeneity than interclass spectral heterogeneity, leading to difficulties in using purely spectral-based classifications. A solution to these issues is to use not only a pixel's spectral characteristics but also its spatial characteristics. In this study, we develop a generalizable "spatialized" classification approach for high spatial resolution image classification. We apply the proposed approach to map vegetation growth forms such as trees, shrubs, and herbs in a forested ecosystem in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Our results found that the spatialized classification approach outperformed spectral-only approaches for all cover classes examined, with the largest improvements being in discriminating vegetation classes.

AB Leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT) are key leaf functional traits providing information for many applications including ecosystem functioning modeling and fire risk management. In this paper, we investigate two common conclusions generally made for LMA and EWT estimation based on leaf optical properties in the near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) domains: (1) physically-based approaches estimate EWT accurately and LMA poorly, while (2) statistically-based and machine learning (ML) methods provide accurate estimates of both LMA and EWT.
   Using six experimental datasets including broadleaf species samples of >150 species collected over tropical, temperate and boreal ecosystems, we compared the performances of a physically-based method (PROSPECT model inversion) and a ML algorithm (support vector machine regression, SVM) to infer EWT and LMA based on leaf reflectance and transmittance. We assessed several merit functions to invert PROSPECT based on iterative optimization and investigated the spectral domain to be used for optimal estimation of LMA and EWT. We also tested several strategies to select the training samples used by the SVM, in order to investigate the generalization ability of the derived regression models.
   We evidenced that using spectral information from 1700 to 2400 nm leads to strong improvement in the estimation of EWT and LMA when performing a PROSPECT inversion, decreasing the LMA and EWT estimation errors by 55% and 33%, respectively.
   The comparison of various sampling strategies for the training set used with SVM suggests that regression models show limited generalization ability, particularly when the regression model is applied on data fully independent from the training set. Finally, our results demonstrate that, when using an appropriate spectral domain, the PROSPECT inversion outperforms SVM trained with experimental data for the estimation of EWT and LMA. Thus we recommend that estimation of LMA and EWT based on leaf optical properties should be physically-based using inversion of reflectance and transmittance measurements on the 1700 to 2400 nm spectral range.

AB Irrigated agriculture is the principal consumer of fresh water resources. Most countries do not have a precise measurement of water consumption for irrigation. In this study, an innovative approach is proposed that allows for estimation of irrigation water use at the catchment scale based on satellite soil moisture data. To this end, the SM2RAIN algorithm, which had been originally developed for estimation of rainfall from the soil moisture observations, is adopted. The satellite soil moisture observations obtained from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) along with different rainfall and evapotranspiration (ET) products in the period 2012-2015 are used as the input to the model. The methodology is tested in the agricultural plains of southern Urmia Lake, which is one of the main agricultural plains in Iran for which actual irrigation data is available.
   The results reveal that the proposed approach can capture the overall irrigation pattern, although; it is systematically overestimating irrigation volume compared to observed irrigation data. Thus the bias is calculated over largely non-irrigated pixels and used to modify the model estimates. The bias-corrected results show good agreement with the in situ irrigation data. In particular, the average model performance in the irrigated pixels in terms of R and RMSE (mm/month) are (0.86 and 12.895) respectively. Accuracy varied depending on the inputs, with improvement in order of 11% and 42% in R and RMSE depending on the inputs chosen. The method is also applied to less irrigated areas that result in obtaining significantly lower irrigation rates.
   The low spatial resolution of soil moisture products (i.e. similar to 50 km) makes it difficult to capture the irrigation water of small irrigated croplands. Unreliable rainfall and ET data can also lead to the over/underestimation of irrigation. In spite of the above limitations (particularly lack of reliable ET dataset), the proposed model can still capture the irrigation pattern, given that strong soil moisture signal from irrigation is detected by the satellite.

AB Impervious surface dynamics have far-reaching consequences on both the environment and human well-being. The expansion of impervious surface is often spontaneous and conscious, particularly in fast developing regions. Thus, monitoring impervious surface dynamics with high temporal frequency in a both accurate and efficient manner is highly needed. Here, we propose an approach to capture continuous impervious surface dynamics using spatial-temporal rules and dense time series stacks of Landsat data. First, a stable area mask based on image classification in the start and the end years is generated to remove pixels that are persistent or spatially irrelevant. The Continuous Change Detection (CCD) algorithm is then employed to determine the change points when non-impervious cover converts to impervious surface based on the property of temporal irreversibility. Finally, the CCD time series models are calibrated for pixels with no change or multiple changes. We apply and assess the proposed approach in Nanchang (China), which has been experiencing rapid impervious surface expansion during the past decade. According to the validation results, overall accuracies of image classification in the start and the end years are 97.2% and 96.7%, respectively. Our approach generates convincing results for impervious surface change detection, with overall accuracy of 85.5% at the annual scale, which is higher than three commonly used approaches in previous studies. At the continuous scale, the mean biases of the detected time of imperviousness emergence are +0.17 (backward) and -3.42 (forward) Landsat revisit periods (16 days) for pixels with one single change and multiple changes, respectively. The derived impervious surface extent maps exhibit comparable performances with five widely used products. The present approach offers a new perspective for providing timely and accurate impervious surface dynamics with dense temporal frequency and high classification accuracy.

AB The NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission conducted a field experiment with its partners over two 40-km agricultural domains in Iowa and Manitoba in the summer of 2016 to address concerns observed in SMAP soil moisture (SM) retrievals over agricultural areas. The experiment featured airborne Passive Active L-band System (PALS) flights over each domain with intensive ground measurements and dense networks of SM monitoring stations. With two intensive observation periods separated in time (May 28 June 20 and July 14 August 16), the flights captured both early-season/low vegetation and later-season/high-vegetation conditions. The comparison of the PALS brightness temperature (TB) measurements to the SMAP TB observed over the sites resulted in root mean square difference (RMSD) of 2.8 K and 4.0 K for vertical and horizontal polarizations, respectively. The subsequent SM analysis resealed the PALS TB with the SMAP TB to allow equitable comparisons between the SM retrievals from the two instruments. The PALS SM retrieval algorithm used the SM sampled by the ground teams during the overpass days for tuning, and was parameterized by a high-resolution vegetation water content product calibrated using vegetation samples collected during the experiment. The tuning process was not able to find a satisfactory result with a temporally constant set of parameters in the single channel algorithm for the two intensive observation periods of the experiment. This result indicated that the rapid change in the vegetation structure during the growth stages and likely variation in the surface roughness conditions were not compatible with rigid parameterization over the entire period. However, using seasonally variable parameters we found that it was possible to retrieve soil moisture with satisfactory accuracy. Comparative analysis with the SMAP SM product included aggregation of the PALS SM to the SMAP pixel-scale. The RMSD between the PALS SM and the aggregated manual field samples was < 0.04 m(3)/m(3) with Pearson correlation > 0.85 for both sites. The comparison between different in situ sources indicated that the soil moisture network measurements were not the source of the large biases observed for SMAP over the sites reported in earlier studies. Therefore, the results suggested the rapidly growing vegetation and the early-season surface condition changes not captured by the SMAP algorithm caused the SMAP retrieval errors. In addition, the significant deviations of the vegetation water content used by the SMAP product from the calibrated vegetation water content obtained during the experiment compounds the problem.

AB Accurate delineation of global built-up area (BUA) is fundamental to a better understanding of human development and the impacts on global environmental change. Existing global datasets of human settlement were mostly generated at medium and coarse spatial resolutions, including BUA and other impervious surfaces. With multiple high-resolution satellite constellations now available (e.g., ZiYuan-3 (ZY3), SPOT-5/6/7, Cartosat-1/2, and WorldView-2/3), identifying the global BUA explicitly from the complex landscapes becomes possible. In this study, a novel method was proposed for automated extraction of BUA at the global scale, by fusing a series of building features. Specifically, two planar features, the Morphological Building Index (MBI) and Harris corner detector, were employed to characterize the structure and corner attributes of buildings. Moreover, two multiangular built-up indices (MABIs), i.e., Ratio Multi-angular Built-up Index (RMABI) and Normalized Difference Multi-angular Built-up Index (NDMABI), were proposed to represent the vertical properties of buildings based on multi-view images, which can further complement the planar features. 45 global cities were selected to validate the performance of the proposed method with images acquired by the ZY3 satellite constellation. The results show that the fusion of MBI and Harris corner can achieve satisfactory accuracy, i.e., 91.12%, 88.85%, 82.82% and 0.85, for the average overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), and F1-score, respectively, for all the test cities. After fusing the MABIs with the planar features, the average OA, UA, PA and F values of the final results were 92.00%, 86.20%, 89.14% and 0.87 for the RMABI, and 91.83%, 85.51%, 89.62% and 0.87 for the NDMABI, respectively. In particular, addition of the MABIs can further reduce the omission errors where medium/high rise buildings with low local contrast exist. We compared our results with two existing state-of-the-art global BUA products, Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) and Global Urban Footprint (GUF), which further corroborated the effectiveness of our method.

AB Knowing the exact sampling depth of microwave radiometry is essential for quantifying the performance and appreciation of the applicability of satellite soil moisture products. We investigate in this study the sampling depth (delta(SM)) of the L-band microwave emission under frozen and thawed soil conditions on the Tibetan Plateau. Two years of diurnal brightness temperature (T-B(p)) measurements at a time interval of 30 min are collected by the ELBARA-III radiometer deployed at a Tibetan meadow site. Vertical profiles of soil temperature and volumetric liquid water content (theta(liq)) are measured simultaneously at soil depths up to 1 m below the surface. The impact of the theta(liq) measured at different depths on the microwave emission simulations is assessed using the tau-omega emission model, whereby the permittivity of frozen and thawed soil is estimated by the four-phase dielectric mixing model. It is found that: 1) the sampling depth for the effective temperature depends on the magnitude of theta(liq), and is estimated to be, on average, about 50 and 15 cm for the cold dry and wet warm period, respectively, because of the seasonality in theta(liq); 2) the delta(SM) is determined at 2.5 cm for both frozen and thawed soil conditions during both cold and warm periods, which is shallower than the commonly used theta(liq) measurement depth (i.e. 5 cm) adopted for the in-situ monitoring networks across the globe; 3) the T-B(p) simulations performed with the theta(liq) measurements taken at the estimated delta(SM) of 2.5 cm result in lower unbiased root mean squared errors, about 14% (3.16 K) and 22% (3.36 K) for the horizontal and vertical polarizations respectively, in comparison to the simulations with the theta(liq) measurements taken from 5 cm soil depth; and 4) the theta(liq) retrieved with the single channel algorithm from the ELBARA-III measured vertically polarized T-B(p) are in better agreement with the theta(liq) measured at 2.5 cm than the one measured at 5 cm. These findings are crucial for developing strategies for the calibration/validation as well as the application of satellite based soil moisture products relying on the L-band radiometry.

AB Multi-temporal analysis has been widely acknowledged as a promising method to derive soil moisture from radar backscatter observations. The method assumes that only soil moisture varies in the period of interest, while all other parameters such as vegetation water content and soil surface roughness are sufficiently time invariant. However, this assumption is not easy to satisfy in agricultural areas where cultivation practices such as ploughing and irrigation are irregularly conducted between radar acquisitions. The paper has proposed an unsupervised change detection method to serve as a pre-processing procedure for multi-temporal retrieval. Briefly, the temporal ratio of HV and the temporal difference of HV/VV and VV polarizations were selected as the optimal feature space, using a genetic algorithm based feature selection algorithm and an extensive synthetic data set. The change map is determined from a two-step procedure with the first step producing multiple over-detected change maps for the period of interest using the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method. The second step merges the multiple change maps to remove the false alarms with a principle similar to the ensemble machine learning. Evaluation on a synthetic data set demonstrated that the proposed method can largely remove the error in multi-temporal soil moisture retrieval that is caused by abrupt roughness and vegetation changes. Evaluation on real radar data sets, including airborne L-band radar, RAD-ARSAT-2 at C-band and COSMO SkyMed at X-band, demonstrated an accurate identification ( > 0.9) while yielding a low false-alarm rate ( < 0.1). These results suggest that the method may be used as a pre-processing stage of global soil moisture retrieval from radar satellite missions with a high revisit frequency, such as Sentinel-1 and SAOCOM-1.

AB Crop type mapping at the field level is necessary for a variety of applications in agricultural monitoring and food security. As remote sensing imagery continues to increase in spatial and temporal resolution, it is becoming an increasingly powerful raw input from which to create crop type maps. Still, automated crop type mapping remains constrained by a lack of field-level crop labels for training supervised classification models, in this study, we explore the use of random forests transferred across geographic distance and time and unsupervised methods in conjunction with aggregate crop statistics for crop type mapping in the US Midwest, where we simulated the label-poor setting by depriving the models of labels in various states and years. We validated our methodology using available 30 m spatial resolution crop type labels from the US Department of Agriculture's Cropland Data Layer (CDL). Using Google Earth Engine, we computed Fourier transforms (or harmonic regressions) on the time series of Landsat Surface Reflectance and derived vegetation indices, and extracted the coefficients as features for machine learning models. We found that random forests trained on regions and years similar in growing degree days (ODD) transfer to the target region with accuracies consistently exceeding 80%. Accuracies decrease as differences in GDD expand. Unsupervised Gaussian mixture models (GMM) with class labels derived using county-level crop statistics classify crops less consistently but require no field-level labels for training. GMM achieves over 85% accuracy in states with low crop diversity (Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Nebraska), but performs sometimes no better than random when high crop diversity interferes with clustering (North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan). Under the appropriate conditions, these methods offer options for field-resolution crop type mapping in regions around the world with few or no ground labels.

AB A two-platform measurement system for realizing airborne thermography of the Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) with similar to 0.8 m pixel resolution (sub-pixel satellite scale) is presented. It consists of a tethered Balloon Launched Imaging and Monitoring Platform (BLIMP) that records LSWT images and an autonomously operating catamaran (called ZiviCat) that measures in situ surface/near surface temperatures within the image area, thus permitting simultaneous ground-truthing of the BLIMP data. The BLIMP was equipped with an uncooled InfraRed (IR) camera. The ZiviCat was designed to measure along predefined trajectories on a lake. Since LSWT spatial variability in each image is expected to be low, a poor estimation of the common spatial and temporal noise of the IR camera (nonuniformity and shutter-based drift, respectively) leads to errors in the thermal maps obtained. Nonuniformity was corrected by applying a pixelwise two-point linear correction method based on laboratory experiments. A Probability Density Function (PDF) matching in regions of overlap between sequential images was used for the drift correction. A feature matching-based algorithm, combining blob and region detectors, was implemented to create composite thermal images, and a mean value of the overlapped images at each location was considered as a representative value of that pixel in the final map. The results indicate that a high overlapping field of view (similar to 95%) is essential for image fusion and noise reduction over such low-contrast scenes. The in situ temperatures measured by the ZiviCat were then used for the radiometric calibration. This resulted in the generation of ISWT maps at sub-pixel satellite scale resolution that revealed spatial LSWT variability, organized in narrow streaks hundreds of meters long and coherent patches of different size, with unprecedented detail.

AB Lakes are sensitive indicators of anthropogenic climate change and also respond to direct human activities. Yet, long-term lake inventories and quantitative evaluation of the factors driving observed lake changes across China remain elusive. Here, for the first time, we examined multi-decadal lake area changes in China during 1960s-2015, using historical topographic maps and > 3831 Landsat satellite images, including lakes as fine as km(2) in size. In addition, we quantified the causes of lake changes from climatic and anthropogenic factors. The total area of lakes in China has increased by 5858.06 km(2) (9%) between 1960s and 2015, and with heterogeneous spatial variations. Lake area changes in the Tibetan Plateau, Xinjiang, and Northeast Plain and Mountain regions reveal significant increases of 5676.75, 1417.15, 1134.87 km(2) (>= 15%), respectively, but the Inner-Mongolian Plateau shows an obvious decrease of 1223.76 km(2) (22%). We find that 141 new lakes have appeared predominantly in the arid western China; but 333 lakes, mainly located in the humid eastern China, have disappeared over the past five decades. We conclude that climate factors have played a dominant role in lake changes across China, coupled with noticeable anthropogenic contribution of similar to 35% in the Eastern Plain and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. This study has substantial implications to improve decision support regarding water-resource management strategies and land-use planning throughout China.

AB Improving the quality of information that can be obtained from forest inventories can enhance planning for the best use of forest resources. In this study, we demonstrate the capability to improve the characterization of forest inventory attributes using terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) data, a fine-scale architectural model (L-Architect), and airborne laser scanner (ALS) data. Terrestrial laser scanning provides detailed and accurate three-dimensional data and has the potential to characterize forest plots with comprehensive structural information. We use TLS data and in situ measurements as input to L-Architect to create reference plots. The use of L-Architect for modeling was validated by comparing selected attributes of the reference plots with validation plots produced using simulated TLS data, with normalized root-mean square error (NMRSE) values below 17%. Surrogate plots were then created using a library of tree models where individual trees were selected according to three attributes tree height, diameter at breast height, and crown projected area either measured from in situ plots or derived from ALS data. The accuracy of the surrogate plots was assessed by comparing several key forest attributes from the reference plots, including branching structure (e.g., number of whorls, knot surface), crown shape and size (e.g., base height, asymmetry), heterogeneity (e.g., lacunarity, fractal dimension), tree volume, and the spatial distribution of material (e.g., Weibull fit, leaf area index). Overall, the surrogate plots reproduced the attributes of the reference plots with NRMSE mean value of 17% (R-2 = 0.68) using in situ ground measurements and 24% (R-2 = 0.51) using inputs estimated with ALS. Some attributes, such as leaf area index, knot surface, and fractal dimension, were well predicted (R-2 > 0.80), whereas others, like crown asymmetry and lacunarity, had weak correspondence (R-2 < 0.16). The ability to create surrogate forest plots with L-Architect makes it possible to estimate detailed structural attributes that are difficult to measure with conventional forest mensuration techniques and that can be used for model calibration with above-canopy remote-sensing data sets.

AB Mapping canopy-forming shrubs in tundra is challenging because approaches that rely on spectral information alone struggle to differentiate low and tall shrubs. We present an evaluation of changes in tall shrub ( > 0.5 m) fractional cover on the North Slope of Alaska between 2000 and 2010, using a new mapping approach that uses satellite imagery from the NASA Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) sensor, ancillary topographic and geographic variables, derived Ross-Li Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) kernel (scattering function) weights, and a Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) model. After training and validating the BRT model, 10 predictor variables explained 53% of the variation in tall shrub fractional cover. The isotropic kernel weight from the BRDF model, topographic slope, nadir camera red reflectance, and latitude were the variables that contributed to the model the most as they were used more frequently to generate the regression trees. At a spatial resolution of 250 m, predicted tall shrub fractional cover on the North Slope ranged from 0.00 to 0.21 (RMSE = 0.03), with the vast majority of sites having fractional cover < 0.02. High shrub fractional cover values were predicted along floodplains, creeks, and sloped terrain. Temporal comparisons of estimated tall shrub abundance indicated that shrubs expanded during the period 2000-2010. The extent of the area that experienced a change in tall shrub fractional cover > 0.06 was < 1% (808 km(2)) of the total area of the North Slope of Alaska (176,524 km(2)). Tall shrubs may have expanded throughout a larger area but there is insufficient precision in the MISR-based estimates to make an indisputable determination. Nevertheless, 94% of the locations that exhibited a robust change showed a positive trend toward an increase in shrub cover. The tall shrub fractional cover expansion rate varied between 0.006 yr(-1) and 0.015 yr(-1), with higher rates in the shrubby southwestern portion of the study area.

AB Operational estimation of spatio-temporal continuously daily evapotranspiration (ET), and the components evaporation (E) and transpiration (T), at river basin scale is very useful for developing sustainable water resource strategies, particularly in regions of limited water supplies. In this study, multi-year all-weather daily ET, E and T were estimated using MODIS-based (Dual Temperature Difference) DTD model under different land covers in the Heihe river basin in China, with a total area of approximately 143 x 10(3) km(2). The remotely sensed ET was validated using ground measurements from large aperture scintillometer systems, with a source area of several kilometers, over grassland, cropland and riparian shrub-forest land cover. The results showed that the remotely sensed ET produced mean absolute percent differences (MAPD) of around 20% with the ground measurements during the growing season under clear sky conditions, but the model performance deteriorated for cloudy days. However, the daily ET product gave reasonable estimates for croplands with an MAPD value of about 20% and the estimates of T/ET and E/ET in good agreement with ground measurements. The DTD model also significantly outperformed other remote sensing-based models being applied globally. Based on these results the DTD model is considered reliable for monitoring crop water use and stress and to develop efficient irrigation strategies.

AB Anthropogenic Marine Debris (AMD) is one of the most important pollutants in the oceans. Millions of tons of debris across oceans have created a critical environmental problem. This study presents a novel method aimed to improve the identification of macroplastics through remote sensing over beaches, combining AMD hyperspectral laboratory characterization and digital supervised classification in high spatial resolution imagery. Several samples were collected from the Chiloe Island beaches, Chile. Spectral signature samples and physical properties were assessed through laboratory work. HyLogger3 (R) (CSIRO), PS-300 Apogee and ASD Field Spec hyperspectral systems were used to characterize each sample. Using those measurements, a spectral library was generated by processing, filtering and sorting the spectral data gathered, determining distinctive spectral bands for digital classification. By using this spectral library, a digital classification method was implemented over World-View 3 imagery, covering the three beaches selected as test sites. Distinct classification methods and geospatial analyses were applied to determine land cover composition, aimed for the detection of Styrofoam and the rest of anthropogenic marine debris. Four field campaigns were carried out to validate the AMD classification and mass retrievals, performed on > 300 ground based points. The AMD hyperspectral library was successfully applied for an AMD digital classification in satellite imagery. Support Vector Machine method showed the best performance, resulting in an overall accuracy equivalent to 88% and over 50 tons of debris estimated on the pilot beaches. These results prove the feasibility of quantifying macro-AMD through the integration of hyperspectral laboratory measurements and remote sensing imagery, allowing to estimate anthropogenic influence on natural ecosystems and providing valuable information for further development of the methodology and sustainable AMD management.

AB The main goal of this study was to assess the potential of SAR backscatter signatures (RH and RV) retrieved from hybrid-polarized RISAT-1 SAR data in providing relevant information about the wheat growth parameters (leaf area index or LAI, plant water content or PWC, plant volume or PV and wet biomass or WB) over the entire growing season. The study was carried out over the parts of Bharatpur and Mathura districts located in Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh (India), respectively. The three-date time series hybrid-polarized dataset was collected coincident to which a comprehensive ground truth campaign was organised. We propose that refining the total backscatter (sigma(0)(total)) values after minimising the effect of underlying/background soil cover, would result in more accurate retrieval of plant parameters since it is the vegetation backscatter, which ultimately has a direct correlation with the crop biophysical parameters. It was achieved using a semi-empirical water cloud model (WCM) based approach. The applicability of four different combinations of canopy descriptors, i.e. leaf area index (LAI), plant water content (PWC), leaf water area index (LWAI) and interaction factor (IF that takes into consideration the moisture distribution per unit volume) was tested on the RH and RV backscatter. We found that WCM based on LAI and IF as the two canopy descriptors modelled the total backscatter with a significantly high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.90 and 0.85, respectively) and RMSE of 1.18 and 1.25 dB, respectively. Subsequently, this set was used to retrieve the soil-corrected vegetation backscatter (sigma(0)(veg)) values. A comparative evaluation of the retrieval accuracy between plant parameters estimated from sigma(0)(total) (sigma(o)(T_RH), sigma(o)(T_RV)) and sigma(0)(veg) (sigma(o)(V_RH), sigma(o)(V_RV)) was performed using rigorously trained multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The findings suggest that the prediction accuracy considerably improved when the backscatter of underlying/background soil cover was eliminated. The designed networks (with sigma(0)(total) as input) retrieved plant water content and plant volume with the highest accuracy of 0.82 and 0.80, respectively while it increased dramatically to 0.87 and 0.89 when the inputs were substituted by sigma(0)(veg). The present study is a first step towards retrieving crop parameters from hybrid-polarized data and thus possesses the potential to serve as a reference for further research initiatives.

AB Traditionally, the multiple images collected by cameras mounted on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) are mosaicked into a single orthophoto on which Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is conducted. This approach does not take advantage of the Multi-View (MV) information of the individual images. In this study, we introduce a new OBIA approach utilizing multi-view information of original UAS images and compare its performance with that of traditional OBIA, which uses only the orthophoto (Ortho-OBIA). The proposed approach, called multi-view object-based image analysis (MV-OBIA), classifies multi-view object instances on UAS images corresponding to each orthophoto object and utilizes a voting procedure to assign a final label to the orthophoto object. The proposed MV-OBIA is also compared with the classification approaches based on Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) simulation. Finally, to reduce the computational burden of multi-view object-based data generation for MV-OBIA and make the proposed approach more operational in practice, this study proposes two window-based implementations of MV-OBIA that utilize a window positioned at the geometric centroid of the object instance, instead of the object instance itself, to extract features. The first window-based MV-OBIA adopts a fixed window size (denoted as FWMV-OBIA), while the second window-based MV-OBIA uses an adaptive window size (denoted as AWMV-OBIA). Our results show that the MV-OBIA substantially improves the overall accuracy compared with Ortho-OBIA, regardless of the features used for classification and types of wetland land covers in our study site. Furthermore, the MV-OBIA also demonstrates a much higher efficiency in utilizing the multi-view information for classification based on its considerably higher overall accuracy compared with BRDF-based methods. Lastly, FWMV-OBIA and AWMV-OBIA both show potential in generating an equal if not higher overall accuracy compared with MV-OBIA at substantially reduced computational costs.

AB Forthcoming spaceborne imaging spectrometers will provide novel opportunities for mapping urban composition globally. To move from case studies for single cities towards comparative and more operational analyses, generalized models that may be transferred throughout space are desired. In this study, we investigated how single regression models can be spatially generalized for vegetation-impervious-soil (VIS) mapping across multiple cities. The combination of support vector regression (SVR) with synthetically mixed training data generated from spectral libraries was used for fraction mapping. We developed three local models based on separate spectral libraries from Berlin (Germany), Brussels (Belgium), and Santa Barbara (U.S.), and a generalized model based on a combined multi-site spectral library. To examine the performance and transferability of the generalized model compared to local models, we first applied all model variants to simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) data from the three cities that were represented in the models, i.e., known sites. Next, we transferred the models to two unknown sites not represented in the models, San Francisco Bay Area (U.S.) and Munich (Germany). In the first mapping constellation, results demonstrated that the generalized model was capable of accurately mapping VIS fractions across all three known sites. Average mean absolute errors (AV-MAEs) were 8.5, 12.2, and 11.0% for Berlin, Brussels, and Santa Barbara. The performance of the generalized model was very similar to the local models, with Delta AV-MAEs falling within a range of +/- 0.7%. A detailed assessment of fraction maps and class-wise accuracies confirmed that modeling errors related to remaining limitations of urban mapping based on optical remote sensing data rather than to the choice between a local or generalized model. For the second mapping constellation, the generalized model proved to be useful for mapping vegetation and impervious fractions in the unknown sites. MAEs for both cover types were 5.4 and 10.9% for the San Francisco Bay Area, and 6.3 and 15.4% for Munich. In contrast, the three local models were only found to have similar accuracies as the generalized model for one of the two sites or for individual VIS categories. Despite the enhanced transferability of the generalized model to the unknown sites, deficiencies remained for accurate soil mapping. MAEs were 22.4 and 12.3%, and high over - and underestimations were observed at the low and high end of the fraction range. These shortcomings indicated possible limitations of the spectral libraries to account for the spectral characteristics of soils in the unknown sites. Overall, we conclude that the combination of SVR and synthetically mixed training data generated from multi-site libraries constitutes a flexible modeling approach for generalized urban mapping across multiple cities.

AB Six years of surface velocities have been calculated over the global ocean by combining altimeter derived geostrophic velocities and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data. The method is based on the inversion for the velocity of the heat conservation equation using the altimeter velocities as background. By accurately prescribing the error both on the background velocities and on the forcing term (heat fluxes), the altimeter background velocities are successfully improved in areas characterized by strong SST gradients and remain unchanged in low SST gradient regions, where by construction no additional information may be brought by the SST field. This allows us to provide for the first time a global field of surface velocities from the merging of altimetry and SST. Both the spatial and temporal resolution of the altimeter derived velocities is enhanced by the SST information. Validation is performed through comparison to in-situ drifting buoy velocities. Major improvements (10-20% globally, up to 35% locally) are obtained on the meridional component of the velocity and in the equatorial band. Due to the large uncertainty on the heat fluxes and the spatio-temporal resolution of the input datasets, the high frequency ageostrophic components of the circulation is hardly resolved by the method and, outside the equatorial band, improvements are mainly on the geostrophic component. It is shown that the level of accuracy obtained by combining altimeter velocities based on a two satellite configuration and microwave SST data is equivalent or higher to the one from a four altimeter constellation in western boundary currents. This opens the perspective for a systematic use of the method to improve the altimeter derived surface velocities over the 1993-2001 period, for which only 2 altimeters have been flying simultaneously. Finally, over the recent years, the use of higher resolution SST products based on both microwave and infrared measurements leads to further enhancement of the accuracy of the altimeter velocities on both the zonal and the meridional component in strong SST gradients areas.

AB Drought is the costliest hazard among all natural disasters. Despite the significant improvements in drought modeling over the last decade, accurate provisions of drought conditions in a timely manner is still a major research challenge. In order to improve the current drought monitoring skills, this study presents a land data assimilation system by merging the remotely sensed surface soil moisture with the model simulations with the use of a recently developed particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method. To cope with the computational complexity, a modular parallel particle filtering framework (PPFF) is developed which allows a large ensemble size in PMCMC applications. The implementation of the proposed system is demonstrated with the 2012 summer flash drought case study over the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Results from both synthetic and real case studies suggest that the land data assimilation system improves the soil moisture predictions and the drought monitoring skills. Compared with the U.S. Drought Monitoring (USDM), the land data assimilation can better capture the drought onset on May 2012 and the drought severity in June and July 2012. This study recommends that the proposed land data assimilation system based on a high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure can better facilitate the drought preparation and response actions.

AB In many applications, estimates are required for small sub-populations with so few (or no) sample plots that direct estimators that do not utilize auxiliary variables (e.g. remotely sensed data) are not applicable or result in low precision. This problem is overcome in small area estimation (SAE) by linking the variable of interest to auxiliary variables using a model. Two types of models can be distinguished based on the scale on which they operate: i) Unit-level models are applied in the well-known area-based approach (ABA) and are commonly used in forest inventories supported by fine-resolution 3D remote sensing data such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) or digital aerial photogrammetry (AP); ii) Area-level models, where the response is a direct estimate based on a sample within the domain and the explanatory variables are aggregated auxiliary variables, are less frequently applied. Estimators associated with these two model types can make use of sample plots within domains if available and reduce to so-called synthetic estimators in domains where no sample plots are available. We used both model types and their associated model-based estimators in the same study area with AP data as auxiliary variables. Heteroscedasticity, i.e. for continuous dependent variables typically an increasing dispersion of residuals with increasing predictions, is often observed in models linking field- and remotely sensed data. This violates the model assumption that the distribution of the residual errors is constant. Complying with model assumptions is required for model-based methods to result in reliable estimates. Addressing heteroscedasticity in models had considerable impacts on standard errors. When complying with model assumptions, the precision of estimates based on unit-level models was, on average, considerably greater (29%-31% smaller standard errors) than those based on area-level models. Area-level models may nonetheless be attractive because they allow the use of sampling designs that do not easily link to remotely sensed data, such as variable radius plots.

ID REANALYSIS
AB Using the air temperature data of the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), we compared multiple layers of air temperature differences before, during and after the Jiujiang earthquake, and explored its relationship with the additive tectonic stress caused by celestial tide-generating force (ATSCTF). The earthquake occurred at the 1 of 4 high phases of ATSCTF, while the temperature rise came from land surface to high sky. It indicated that the tide force could trigger an earthquake when the tectonic stress was in critical status, and the air temperature rise reflected the terra stress change modulated under the tidal force. During the shock period of ATSCTF, the distribution of air temperature changes both near land surfaces and upper multi-layers along the active fault zones showed a tectonic disturbance pattern of calm before earthquake, rise during earthquake, calm after earthquake as well as a heat distribution pattern of the surface air warmed by land, uplifted by heat flux, cooled and dissipated in the sky. The pattern of changes obeyed the rule of thermal rise of rocks broken under stress loading and the principle of atmospheric thermal dynamic diffusion in vertical. We argued that an earthquake may also be a reason for air temperature differences rather than a simple weather process. At the same time, the rise of air temperature was synchronized with the ATSCTF fluctuant, which showed that tidal force had a particular indicative significance for the identification of temperature anomaly on seismic faults. Because of the mechanical characteristics of the study of earthquake thermal anomalies, it could help to identify the earthquake thermal anomalies and the climatic thermal anomalies, and provided a clear time-indication for the choice of the background temperature in the seismic thermal anomaly recognition.

AB Space borne radar altimeters often complement in-situ water levels to provide greater insights to hydrodynamic models in sparsely gauged catchments. However, 10-day or 35-day water levels derived from satellite radar altimetry are generally too infrequent for flood forecasting or hydrodynamic modelling purposes. This paper proposes a new approach to find daily water levels for areas where in-situ river heights are not available. The new approach is based on the relationship between river height and difference between daytime and night time land surface temperatures (LST). This relationship is first demonstrated using in-situ gauge data to explore appropriate statistical models to predict river height using LST differences. The approach is then applied to a number of virtual stations at the intersections between the Mekong River and the ground-tracks of Jason-2 satellite altimetry which gives 10-day water level time series.
   The LST difference from the thermal infrared (TIR) observations of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is shown to have a strong relationship with in-situ water levels and a good relationship with the Jason-2 water levels. The models included a simple linear regression model which was then extended to firstly include seasonal terms and secondly assimilate satellite altimetry data. A regression model tree (M5) was also considered but was found to be inferior to the seasonal linear model. The developed regression models were used to predict daily water levels to infill the 10-day Jason-2 altimeters. RMSE of modelled daily water levels at gauges is between 0.3 m to 0.6 m, while RMSE of modelled daily water levels without using in-situ data is higher varying from 1.4 m to 1.9 m. The temporal correlation between the modelled water levels using satellite altimeters at virtual stations and in-situ water levels at adjacent gauges ranged from 0.72 to 0.86. These results show the potential of the proposed approach to produce high temporal resolution water levels for flood models or other applications using only remotely sensed data.

AB Interactions between climate and ecosystem properties that control phenological responses to climate warming and drought are poorly understood. To determine contributions from these interactions, we used space-borne remotely sensed vegetation indices to monitor leaf development across climate gradients and ecoregions in the southeastern United States. We quantified how air temperature, drought severity, and canopy thermal stress contribute to changes in leaf flushing from mountainous to coastal plain regions by developing a hierarchical state-space Bayesian model. We synthesized daily field climate data with daily vegetation indices and canopy surface temperature during spring green-up season at 59 sites in the southeastern United States between 2001 and 2012. Our results demonstrated strong interaction effects between ecosystem properties and climate variables across ecoregions. We found spring green-up is faster in the mountains, while coastal forests express a larger sensitivity to inter-annual temperature anomalies. Despite our detection of a decreasing trend in sensitivity to warming with temperature in all regions, we identified an ecosystem interaction: Deciduous dominated forests are less sensitive to warming than are those with fewer deciduous trees, likely due to the continuous presence of leaves in evergreen species throughout the season. Mountainous forest green-up is more susceptible to intensifying drought and moisture deficit, while coastal areas are relatively resilient. We found that with increasing canopy thermal stress, defined as canopy-air temperature difference, leaf development slows following dry years, and accelerates following wet years.

AB Severe fires in tropical savanna systems are recognised as incurring significant impacts on a variety of ecological attributes, including woody vegetation structure and greenhouse gas emissions. However, knowledge of the frequency and extent of severe fires is restricted given challenges associated with the development of reliable remotely sensed mapping procedures. This study takes advantage of three wildfires, 900-5300 km(2) in extent, containing very severely affected areas, occurring in semi-evergreen, eucalypt-dominated, tropical Australian savanna, which resulted in significant areas of complete canopy scorch, very significant tree stem mortality (24-55%), and associated loss of living above ground biomass (47-69%) at respective sites. Although increased map scale is generally considered to improve the reliability of fire severity mapping, our analysis found > 90% agreement between Landsat and MODIS-derived burnt area mapping, and > 80% for binary (severe vs. non severe) fire severity mapping. Mapping of internal fire (unburnt) patchiness was enhanced with finer resolution Landsat imagery, but the much longer orbital return cycle precluded its use at two of the three sites given extended cloudy conditions. Application of an automated MODIS-derived fire severity mapping algorithm (overall reliability in 2015 = 75%) calibrated for generalised north Australian savanna conditions, suggests that 15% and 12% of Australia's 1.3 M km(2) tropical savannas region were burnt by severe fires in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The study illustrates the potential for MODIS-derived fire severity mapping, the impacts of very severe fires on stand structure, and ongoing challenges associated with deriving reliable fire severity mapping products in Australian savanna systems.

TI PROCWT: Coupling PROSPECT with continuous wavelet transform to improve
   the retrieval of foliar chemistry from leaf bidirectional reflectance

AB The leaf optical properties model PROSPECT has been widely used to retrieve foliar chemistry in reverse mode from directional-hemispherical reflectance factor (DHRF) spectra measured with integrating sphere equipped spectrometers. With bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) spectra, some researchers attempted to invert PROSPECT after a modification to the latest version of the model. However, the retrieval accuracy varies greatly with chemical constituents and can be low for some of them, such as dry matter content. This paper proposes a new approach called PROCWT by coupling PROSPECT with continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to suppress the surface reflectance effect and enhance the absorption features of chemical constituents. Instead of the reflectance spectra, the wavelet coefficient spectra generated after CWT were used to construct the merit function for model inversion. Given that the multi-scale decomposition of CWT enables enhancement of chemical-specific absorption features, the use of PROCWT at different scales of wavelet decomposition could lead to improved retrievals of biochemical parameters. The performance of PROCWT was evaluated for estimating foliar chemicals of wheat and rice crops from BRF spectra measured with a leaf clip equipped spectrometer over a two-year field experiment. PROCWT was also compared with the standard PROSPECT inversion (STANDARD), the PROSPECT inversion with the subtraction of surface reflectance (PROREF), and the simplified PROCOSINE (sPROCOSINE).
   Our results demonstrated that the contribution of surface reflectance component was significant for BRF spectra and the effect of surface reflectance could be suppressed by PROCWT as well as PROREF and sPROCOSINE. Compared with STANDARD, PROCWT and the two traditional methods significantly improved the retrieval accuracies for pigments and leaf water content, but only PROCWT produced significant improvement for dry matter content with a decrease of 14.79 g/m(2) in the root mean squared error (RMSE) (30% of the mean) over the entire experimental dataset by enhancing dry matter absorption features. High scales of wavelet decomposition were favorable for the estimation of carotenoid and water contents and low scales for the estimation of chlorophyll and dry matter contents. The difference in optimal scale revealed the separation of overlapping absorption features attributed to various chemical constituents. In addition, the newest PROSPECT-D outperformed PROSPECT-5B in the retrieval of chlorophyll content but not for carotenoid. This new physically based approach could be beneficial to analysts attempting to retrieve leaf chemicals from BRF spectra alone and close-range reflectance imagery of crops and even other vegetation types.

AB An accurate temporal and spatial characterization of errors is required for the efficient processing, evaluation, and assimilation of remotely-sensed surface soil moisture retrievals. However, empirical evidence exists that passive microwave soil moisture retrievals are prone to periodic artifacts which may complicate their application in data assimilation systems (which commonly treat observational errors as being temporally white). In this paper, the link between such temporally-periodic errors and spatial land surface heterogeneity is examined. Both the synthetic experiment and site-specified cases reveal that, when combined with strong spatial heterogeneity, temporal periodicity in satellite sampling patterns (associated with exact repeat intervals of the polar-orbiting satellites) can lead to spurious high frequency spectral peaks in soil moisture retrievals. In addition, the global distribution of the most prominent and consistent 8-day spectral peak in the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System soil moisture retrievals is revealed via a peak detection method. Three spatial heterogeneity indicators based on microwave brightness temperature, land cover types, and long-term averaged vegetation index are proposed to characterize the degree to which the variability of land surface is capable of inducing periodic error into satellite-based soil moisture retrievals. Regions demonstrating 8-day periodic errors are generally consistent with those exhibiting relatively higher heterogeneity indicators. This implies a causal relationship between spatial land surface heterogeneity and temporal periodic error in remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals.

AB Timely and accurate data regarding the distribution of paddy rice are valuable for various agricultural studies. In this study, we aimed to develop a sub-pixel method for estimating the planting fraction of paddy rice in Northeast China. This method assumes low seasonal variations in moisture in paddy rice fields compared with other upland crops due to the presence of flooding water throughout the growing season. We used the coefficient of variation (CV) of the land surface water index (LSWI) derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) to indicate the water condition. High resolution images obtained by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were used to test this assumption and to develop the relationship between the CV of LSWI and the planting fraction of paddy rice. The results showed that the CV of LSWI could effectively indicate the planting fraction of paddy rice, where our method explained 84% of the variation in the planting fraction of paddy rice in the UAV survey sites. Validation based on the statistical data showed that this method explained 78% and 85% of the variations in the paddy rice area at the county and prefecture levels, respectively. Moreover, the performance of this method was good independent of the field survey data, and this alternative approach may facilitate mapping of the planting distribution of paddy rice over large areas.

AB In this paper we present the activities performed at the Microwaves and Radar Institute of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to derive global forest/non-forest classification mosaics from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data acquired by the TanDEM-X mission. The data have been collected between 2011 and 2016 in bistatic stripmap single polarization (HH) mode, with the main goal of generating a consistent, timely, and highly accurate 3D representation of the global terrain's surface (digital elevation model, DEM). The global data set of quicklook images, which represent a spatially averaged version of the original full resolution data at a ground independent pixel spacing of 50 m x 50 m, was used as input, in order to limit the computational burden. For classification purposes, several observables, systematically provided by the TanDEM-X system, can be exploited, such as the calibrated amplitude, the digital elevation model (DEM), and the interferometric coherence. Among the several factors contributing to a coherence degradation in InSAR data, the so-called volume correlation factor quantifies the coherence loss due to volume scattering phenomena, which typically occur in presence of vegetation. This quantity is directly derived from the interferometric coherence and used as main indicator for the identification of vegetated areas. For this purpose, a fuzzy multi-clustering classification approach, which takes into account the geometry and acquisition configuration, is applied to each acquired scene separately. A certain variability of the interferometric coherence at X band was observed among different forest types, mainly due to changes in forest structure, density, and tree height, which led to an adjustment of the algorithm settings depending on the considered type of forest. The identification of additional information layers, such as urban settlements or water areas, is also discussed, and the procedure for mosaicking of over-lapping acquisitions (two at global scale, up to ten over mountainous terrain, forests, and desert regions) to improve the classification accuracy is detailed. The resulting global forest/non-forest map was validated using external reference information as well as with other existing classification maps and an overall agreement was observed that often exceeds 90%. Finally, examples for high-resolution (at 12 m x 12 m) forest maps and potentials for deforestation monitoring over selected regions are presented as well, demonstrating the unique capabilities offered by the TanDEM-X bistatic system for a broad range of geoinformation services and scientific applications. The global TanDEM-X forest/non-forest map presented in this paper will be made available to the scientific community for free download and usage.

AB Accurate quantification of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is the foundation to the responses of diverse forest ecosystems to the changing climate. Lidar-based statistical models have been used to accurately estimate AGB in large spatial extents, especially in boreal and temperate softwood forest ecosystems. However, the few available models for temperate hardwood and hardwood-dominated mixed forests are low in accuracy due both to the deliquescent growth form of hardwood trees and the strong site-to-site variations in height-diameter relationship. In this study, we established multiplicative nonlinear regression models that incorporated both lidar-derived metrics and soil-based site productivity classes (high and low productivity sites) to estimate aboveground biomass in temperate hardwood forests. The final optimized model had high accuracy (R-2 = 0.81; RMSE = 45.5 Mg ha(-1)) with reliable performance in ABG estimation by integrating relative height metrics at 75 and 70 percentiles (RH75 and RH70), canopy coverage and site productivity class. An optimized model that included an index of site productivity explained 14% more variance than the best-fit model without the term. Moreover, the relationship between AGB and lidar-based metrics was nonlinear on low productivity sites and nearly linear on high productivity sites, further indicating the importance of including direct or indirect measures of site productivity in lidar-based biomass models, particularly for those applied to temperate hardwood forests. Our new lidar-based model provides a potential framework to integrate lidar-based structural information and soil-based site productivity to improve AGB estimation in temperate hardwood forests.

AB Although remote sensing has long been used to aid in the estimation of population, it has usually been in the context of spatial disaggregation of national census data, with the census counts serving both as observational data for specifying models and as constraints on model outputs. Here we present a framework for estimating populations from the bottom up, entirely independently of national census data, a critical need in areas without recent and reliable census data. To make observations of population density, we replace national census data with a microcensus, in which we enumerate population for a sample of small areas within the states of Kano and Kaduna in northern Nigeria. Using supervised texture-based classifiers with very high resolution satellite imagery, we produce a binary map of human settlement at 8-meter resolution across the two states and then a more refined classification consisting of 7 residential types and 1 non-residential type. Using the residential types and a model linking them to the population density observations, we produce population estimates across the two states in a gridded raster format, at approximately 90-meter resolution. We also demonstrate a simulation framework for capturing uncertainty and presenting estimates as prediction intervals for any region of interest of any size and composition within the study region. Used in concert with previously published demographic estimates, our population estimates allowed for predictions of the population under 5 in ten administrative wards that fit strongly with reference data collected during polio vaccination campaigns.

AB This paper proposes a benchmarking method for assessing the level of spatio-temporal variability of Essential Climate Variable (ECV) products against a reference taking into account acceptance criteria in terms of intensity and physical distance tolerances. This is based on a modified version of the gamma index that could be suitable for fitness-for-purpose assessment given that one can choose various criteria depending on applications.
   The method is first presented and then applied to both land and atmospheric ECVs. The terrestrial analysis concerns the global surface albedo, using monthly white-sky surface albedo in the visible, near-infrared and shortwave broadband spectral ranges at a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees using three sources of products. The latter study is conducted using monthly aerosol optical depth (ADD) products at 550 nm at a spatial resolution of 1 with four different datasets at the global scale. The analysis shows how the values of the gamma criteria impact the spatial and temporal results.
   As an example, if the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) actual target measurements uncertainty is used as an acceptance criteria for the intensity tolerance the results show that: 1) the seasonal agreement for the surface albedo products varies over 20% to 40% of the terrestrial surface in the shortwave and near infrared broadband and from 10% to 30% in the visible one and 2) the three aerosols optical depth products agree with the reference one for over 50% of the land surface only when the tolerance distance term is at 224km.

AB Ash (Fraxinus L.) species are currently threatened by the emerald ash borer (EAB; Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire) across a growing area in the eastern US. Accurate mapping of ash species is required to monitor the host resource, predict EAB spread and better understand the short- and long-term effects of EAB on the ash resource. Hyperspectral remote sensing technologies have been used to successfully map forest species, although most efforts are focused on healthy canopies for relatively homogeneous forested stands. This study uses imagery collected by the NASA Goddard LiDAR, Hyperspectral and Thermal (GLiHT) airborne imager to map ash species at the tree level in an EAB infested urban setting. The overall goal of the study is to understand how canopy condition impacts species mapping accuracy and identify data collection and image processing techniques to more accurately map the location of ash species in infested regions.
   Results indicate that while overall independent validation mapping accuracy of ash and non-ash trees was 81%, correct identification of ash canopies dropped from 62% for vigor 1 trees to 22% for vigor 2 trees. To minimize these errors, we developed a multiple endmember, spectral unmixing technique to overcome challenges presented by a spectrally complicated target in a complex urban environment. This hinges on the use of endmember spectra from trees across a range of canopy condition, including the derivation of vegetation indices to inform the spectral unmixing calibration. This approach was more accurate than calibrations performed using traditional unmixing based only on pure endmember spectra.
   Implications for this work suggest that urban forest managers may attain more accurate maps by conducting remote sensing data collections prior to infestation while the trees are still healthy. Where this is not possible, mapping efforts must reflect a range of canopy conditions and include vegetation indices concurrent with reflectance data. The resulting ash species maps provide urban forest managers spatially explicit products to help estimate the extent of possible impacts in their communities, guide the implementation of management and monitoring efforts and provide the basis for planning as EAB continues to spread.

AB Monitoring and mapping land cover changes are important ways to support evaluation of the status and transition of ecosystems. The Alaska National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 was the first 30-m resolution baseline land cover product of the entire state derived from circa 2001 Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary data. We developed a comprehensive approach named AKUP11 to update Alaska NLCD from 2001 to 2011 and provide a 10-year cyclical update of the state's land cover and land cover changes. Our method is designed to characterize the main land cover changes associated with different drivers, including the conversion of forests to shrub and grassland primarily as a result of wildland fire and forest harvest, the vegetation successional processes after disturbance, and changes of surface water extent and glacier ice/snow associated with weather and climate changes. For natural vegetated areas, a component named AKUP11-VEG was developed for updating the land cover that involves four major steps: 1) identify the disturbed and successional areas using Landsat images and ancillary datasets; 2) update the land cover status for these areas using a SKILL model (System of Knowledge-based Integrated -trajectory Land cover Labeling); 3) perform decision tree classification; and 4) develop a final land cover and land cover change product through the postprocessing modeling. For water and ice/snow areas, another component named AKUP11-WIS was developed for initial land cover change detection, removal of the terrain shadow effects, and exclusion of ephemeral snow changes using a 3-year MODIS snow extent dataset from 2010 to 2012. The overall approach was tested in three pilot study areas in Alaska, with each area consisting of four Landsat image footprints. The results from the pilot study show that the overall accuracy in detecting change and no-change is 90% and the overall accuracy of the updated land cover label for 2011 is 86%. The method provided a robust, consistent, and efficient means for capturing major disturbance events and updating land cover for Alaska. The method has subsequently been applied to generate the land cover" and land cover change products for the entire state of Alaska. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Automatic detection and monitoring of freezing injury in crops is of vital importance for assessing plant physiological status and yield losses. This study investigates the potential of hyperspectral techniques for detecting leaves at the stages of freezing and post-thawing injury, and for quantifying the impacts of freezing injury on leaf water and pigment contents. Four experiments were carried out to acquire hyperspectral reflectance and biochemical parameters for oilseed rape plants subjected to freezing treatment. Principal component analysis and support vector machines were applied to raw reflectance, first and second derivatives (SDR), and inverse logarithmic reflectance to differentiate freezing and the different stages of post-thawing from the normal leaf state. The impacts on biochemical retrieval using particular spectral domains were also assessed using a multivariate analysis. Results showed that SDR generated the highest classification accuracy (>95.6%) in the detection of post-thawed leaves. The optimal ratio vegetation index (RVI) generated the highest predictive accuracy for changes in leaf water content, with a cross validated coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.85 and a cross validated root mean square error (RMSECV) of 2.4161 mg/cm(2). Derivative spectral indices outperformed multivariate statistical methods for the estimation of changes in pigment contents. The highest accuracy was found between the optimal RVI and the change in carotenoids content (R-cv(2) = 0.70 and RMSECV = 0.0015 mg/cm(2)). The spectral domain 400-900 nm outperformed the full spectrum in the estimation of individual pigment contents, and hence this domain can be used to reduce redundancy and increase computational efficiency in future operational scenarios. Our findings indicate that hyperspectral remote sensing has considerable potential for characterizing freezing injury in oilseed rape, and this could form a basis for developing satellite remote sensing products for crop monitoring.

AB Monitoring ground surface displacement of volcanoes over a long period of time helps improve understanding of the volcano structure, dynamics and mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the spatio-temporal behavior of the long-term displacement field at Piton de la Fournaise volcano (12 Reunion Island) by means of X-band InSAR and GNSS time series analysis from 2009 to 2014. We propose a new correction approach based on principal component analysis to mitigate the long-wavelength artifact in the interferograms over the study area. Our results show that most of the volcanic edifice including the Central Cone, the Eastern Flank and recent lava flow fields was affected by varying degrees of ground motion. More importantly, a widespread sector (similar to 20 km(2)) affected by time-dependent downward and eastward motion was observed on the Eastern Flank of Piton de la Fournaise. The combined analysis of InSAR and GNSS time series and previous studies allows us to confirm that this large mobile sector on the Eastern Flank underwent deformation for at least 7 years following the end of the large March-April 2007 eruption, including a stage of transient strain from the end of eruption to February 2011, followed by a stage of steady-state strain until late 2014. Several possible origins, including a pre-existing structural discontinuity, summit stress associated with magmatism, and activated fault movement are explored to explain the observed widespread long-term seaward motion that is considered to be direct evidence of potential flank instability.

AB Driven by massive urbanization processes, particularly in developing countries, people flock into the cities resulting in an evolution of large slum areas. Mapping and monitoring of slum areas have become an invaluable source for decision-making processes to implement policies related to improve living conditions. Space-borne remotely sensed data has been explored in the past for slum mapping, however, to a large extent supported by optical imagery. In this paper, we explore the capabilities of dual-polarized (HH/VV and W/VH) X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) from TerraSAR-X images for slum extent mapping using the Kennaugh element framework for image preprocessing. In this way, spatial image descriptors based on texture, morphological profiles and polarimetric features have been tested at various window sizes [11 x 11,...,161 x 1611 for mapping slums using the random forest classifier in a series of experiments. For benchmarking the classification results, LDA as parametric linear classifier is used for comparison. Classification performance was evaluated by comparison with a reference map indicating that texture features hold the highest contribution to discriminating slums from other urban structures. Best window size was found using a spatial neighborhood of 81 x 81 pixels resulting in Overall Accuracy of 88.58 and Kappa of 0.7809 for RF classifier. A patch-based analysis of classification results reveals areal dependencies of the classifier in terms of larger slum patches that are mapped with higher precision than smaller patches. Analyses including additional spatial image descriptors based on mathematical profiles reveal no significant contribution to the classification result. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The VIIRS-DNB sensor launched in 2011 offers the remote sensing community improved capabilities for monitoring and quantifying nighttime brightness. So far, most studies of temporal changes in nighttime lights were focused on examining inter-annual trends or on sudden changes in light emission, related to demographic and economic reasons. Here, the recently released two year (2014-2015) set of monthly cloud-free VIIRS-DNB composites was used to explicitly examine seasonal changes in nighttime lights and their correspondence with seasonality of land cover in Northern and Central America. It was found that monthly changes in nighttime brightness were positively correlated with monthly changes in snow cover and in albedo, and negatively correlated with monthly changes in NDVI. These correlations were strongest in urban areas in the northeast of the USA, where high correlation coefficient values (>0.8) were obtained. Seasonality in nighttime brightness is thus an important factor to consider both when quantifying trends in light emission from annual time series, and in studies examining the adverse consequences of artificial lights on human health and on the environment.

AB The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat-8 is generating high-quality aquatic science products, the most critical of which is the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), defined as the ratio of water-leaving radiance to the total downwelling irradiance just above water. The quality of the R-rs products has not, however, been extensively assessed. This manuscript provides a comprehensive evaluation of Level-1B, i.e., top of atmosphere reflectance, and R-rs products available from OLI imagery under near-ideal atmospheric conditions in moderately turbid waters. The procedure includes a) evaluations of the R-rs products at sites included in the Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET-OC), b) intercomparisons and cross-calibrations against other ocean color products, and c) optimizations of vicarious calibration gains across the entire OLI observing swath. Results indicate that the near-infrared and shortwave infrared (NIR-SWIR) band combinations yield the most robust and stable R-rs retrievals in moderately turbid waters. Intercomparisons against products derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Aqua platform (MODISA) indicate slight across-track non-uniformities (<1%) associated with OLI scenes in the blue bands. In both product domains (TOA and R-rs), on average, the OLI products were found larger in radiometric responses in the blue channels. Following the implementation of updated vicarious calibration gains and accounting for across-track non-uniformities, matchup analyses using independent in-situ validation data confirmed improvements in R-rs products. These findings further support high-fidelity OLI-derived aquatic science products in terms of both demonstrating a robust atmospheric correction method and providing consistent products across OLI's imaging swath.

AB It is well known that remote sensing techniques hold the potential to explore the spatial estimation of air temperature (T-a) with fine spatial and temporal resolution across the world. However, because of the complex interaction of land-atmosphere systein and the contamination of cloud cover, the retrieval of daytime T-a exclusively from remote sensing data is still far from straight forward, especially under cloudy sky conditions. In this paper, we presented a simple parameterization scheme of daytime T-a under all-weather conditions entirely based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. To evaluate its applicability, the scheme was demonstrated in two regions with totally different geomorphological and climatic conditions, the east part of the Qaidam Basin (EQB) in China and the Southern Great Plains (SGP) in the United States of America. The instantaneous T-a under clear sky conditions (T-a,T-clear) was determined as the average of near surface air temperature (T-a(s)) retrieved from MOD07_L2 product and land surface temperature (T-s) retrieved from MOD06_12 product. Then a regression model between T-a,T-clear and T-s was established, and the instantaneous Ta under cloudy sky conditions (T-a,T-cloudy) was estimated by applying the regression model to T-s retrieved under cloudy sky conditions. The results showed that the averaging parameterization scheme has significantly improved the accuracy of T-a,T-clear retrievals with MAE = 1.95 degrees C, RMSE = 2.50 degrees C, and B = 0.02 in the EQB, and MAE = 2.02 degrees C, RMSE = 2.56 degrees C, and B = 0.01 in the SGP. The T-a,T-cloudy estimates also showed good agreement with T-a observations in both regions with a correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.91. The values of RMSE calculated for the EQB and SGP were 3.42 degrees C and 2.91 degrees C, respectively. The accuracy of both T-a,T-clear and T-a,T-cloudy estimates has reached a level comparable with other traditional statistical approaches that adopt ancillary T-a measurements as training dataset. Therefore, it is feasible to estimate daytime T-a under all-weather conditions entirely based on MODIS products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Vegetation structure controls habitat availability, ecosystem services, weather, climate and microclimate, but current landscape scale vegetation maps have lacked details of understorey vegetation and within canopy structure at resolutions finer than a few tens of metres. In this paper, a novel signal processing method is used to correctly measure 3D voxelised vegetation cover from full-waveform ALS data at 1.5 m horizontal and 50 cm vertical resolution, including understorey vegetation and within-canopy structure. A new method for calibrating and validating the instrument specific ALS processing using high resolution TLS data is also presented and used to calibrate and validate the ALS derived data products over a wide range of land cover types within a heterogeneous urban area, including woodland, gardens and streets. This showed the method to accurately retrieve voxelised canopy cover maps with less than 0.4% of voxels containing false negatives, 10% of voxels containing false positives and a canopy cover accuracy within voxels of 24%. The method was applied across 100 km2 and the resulting structure maps were compared to the more widely used discrete return ALS and Gaussian decomposed waveform ALS data products. These products were found to give little information on the within-canopy structure and so are only capable of deriving coarse resolution, plot-scale structure metrics. The detailed 3D canopy maps derived from the new method allow landscape scale ecosystem processes to be examined in more detail than has previously been possible, and the new method reveals details about the canopy understorey, creating opportunities for ecological investigations. The calibration method can be applied to any waveform ALS instrument and processing method.

AB Landslide mapping (LM) is essential for hazard prevention, mitigation, and vulnerability assessment. Despite the great efforts over the past few years, there is room for improvement in its accuracy and efficiency. Existing LM is primarily achieved using field surveys or visual interpretation of remote sensing images. However, such methods are highly labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly over large areas. Thus, in this paper a change detection-based Markov random field (CDMRF) method is proposed for near-automatic LM from aerial orthophotos. The proposed CDMRF is applied to a landslide-prone site with an area of approximately 40 km2 on Lantau Island, Hong Kong. Compared with the existing region-based level set evolution (RLSE), it has three main advantages: 1) it employs a more robust threshold method to generate the training samples; 2) it can identify landslides more accurately as it takes advantages of both the spectral and spatial contextual information of landslides; and 3) it needs little parameter tuning. Quantitative evaluation shows that it outperforms RLSE in the whole study area by almost 5.5% in Correctness and by 4% in Quality. To our knowledge, it is the first time CDMRF is used to LM from bitemporal aerial photographs. It is highly generic and has great potential for operational LM applications in large areas and also can be adapted for other sources of imagery data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present article reports an improvement in the INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm which is currently operational in the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). The proposed Modified-IMSRA (M-IMSRA) algorithm deviates from original IMSRA in two ways: first is by improvement in rain/no-rain area detection scheme using a Multi Index Rain Detection (MIRD) index; second is based on the climate region-wise correction through Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) models developed for each climate regions using rainfall (obtained based on first improvement) and static topographic variables extracted from Digital Elevation Model (DEM). The overall results indicate that the M-IMSRA is performing better than the IMSRA in all climatic regions when compared with the IMD gridded gauge data. However, the improvement is not uniform in all the regions. The inclusion of the MIRD index led to considerable improvement in M-IMSRA-based rainfall estimates mainly in the arid regions. Likewise, the results obtained after the LASSO regression corrections indicate that they are necessary only for the orographic regions where significant improvements are observed in the rainfall estimates. Finally, the inter-comparison of the simple hybrid M-IMSRA estimates with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 V7 and TRMM 3B42-RT V7 illustrates that the M-IMSRA performs nearly as well as even better (except in terms of Correlation Coefficient) than the complex multi-satellite-based rainfall estimates in all the climate regions of India. Considering the above results, it can be said that the performance of simple hybrid algorithms such as IMSRA can be improved to match the quality or even outperform complex multi-satellite rainfall estimates by incorporating appropriate corrections.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) enables the mapping of flooding over large areas, regardless of cloud and weather conditions. Simplified classification approaches based on threshold levels of backscattering intensity are typical in operational flood monitoring. Backscattering intensity from floods over open non-forested areas is typically lower, whereas backscatter from forest floods is higher compared to non-flooded areas. However, distinction of flooded areas from non-flooded surface in semi-forested areas with low canopy closure (CC) or low tree height (TH) is expected to be difficult due to confounding effects of the different scattering mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate X-band SAR backscattering in flooded boreal forests with varying TH and CC, and to quantify in which cases floods would be difficult to detect with typical threshold-based classification methods. To further understand the SAR signal behavior in flooded forests, the total backscatter was modeled using the HUT (Helsinki University of Technology) semi-empirical forest backscattering model. HH-polarized Cosmo Sky-Med acquisitions from four different locations in Finland were analyzed against airborne LiDAR based forest data, ground observations and a high resolution digital elevation model. Floods were well detected in open areas and dense forests. However, as hypothesized, when TH was higher than zero but lower than 4-5 m, or when CC was higher than zero but lower than 15-20%, the detection was less successful. TH was found to have slightly more influence on the capability of X-band SAR to detect floods than CC. In our four test areas, namely Kittila, Kolari, Pudasjarvi and Evo, 853%, 89.1%, 82.7% and 73.9% of the total floods were detected, respectively, by a simple threshold value method. The model was able to successfully estimate the different backscattering components of the flooded forests in Kittila and Pudasjarvi, where the number of observations from all forest conditions was sufficient.

AB Marsh canopy structure was mapped yearly from 2009 to 2012 in the Barataria Bay, Louisiana coastal region that was impacted by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. Based on the previously demonstrated capability of NASA's UAVSAR polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PoISAR) image data to map Spartina alterniflora marsh canopy structure, structure maps combining the leaf area index (LAI) and leaf angle distribution (IAD, orientation) were constructed for yearly intervals that were directly relatable to the 2010 LAI-LAD classification. The yearly LAI-LAD and LAI difference maps were used to investigate causes for the previously revealed dramatic change in marsh structure from prespill (2009) to postspill (2010, spill cessation), and the occurrence of structure features that exhibited abnormal spatial and temporal patterns. Water level and salinity records showed that freshwater releases used to keep the oil offshore did not cause the rapid growth from 2009 to 2010 in marsh surrounding the inner Bay. Photointerpretation of optical image data determined that interior marsh patches exhibiting rapid change were caused by burns and burn recovery, and that the pattern of 2010 to 2011 1AI decreases in backshore marsh and extending along some tidal channels into the interior marsh were not associated with burns. Instead, the majority of 2010 to 2011 shoreline features aligned with vectors displaying the severity of 2010 shoreline oiling from the DWH spill. Although the association is not conclusive of a causal oil impact, the coexistent pattern is a significant discovery. PoISAR marsh structure mapping provided a unique perspective of marsh biophysical status that enhanced detection of change and monitoring of trends important to management effectiveness.

AB The estimation of the proportion of land-cover and land-use classes is considered by exploiting remote sensing based imagery. A pure-panel survey based on point sampling is adopted. An initial sample of points is selected by means of tessellation stratified sampling (TSS). The sample points are classified based on the imagery available for the years of interest to estimate land-cover or land-use proportions and their changes. To reduce the sampling effort, the initial selection of points is viewed as the first phase of sampling and a subsample of these points is selected in a second phase by means of one-per-stratum stratified sampling (OPSS). Land-use estimation at any subsequent year is then based on the classifications performed on the points of the second-phase sample. Two-phase estimators of proportions and of their changes are suggested, and their theoretical properties are derived. Presumably conservative estimators of their variances are proposed. A check of the precision lost involved when changing from one- to two-phase sampling is determined from the assessment of land use in Italy as a case study and from an artificial population generated to resemble the current land-use situation in Italy.

AB The spatial distribution, magnitude and timing of precipitation events are being altered globally, often leading to extreme hydrologic conditions with serious implications to the environment and society. Motivated by the pressing need to understand, from a hydro-ecological perspective, the impact of the dynamic nature of the hydrologic cycle on the environment in water-stressed regions, we investigated how different habitats in East Africa behave under extreme hydrologic conditions. We assessed the hydro-ecological vulnerability of the region by studying the response of soil moisture and vegetation water content to precipitation deficiency. The spatial patterns and characteristics of the inter-relations among the three aforementioned hydrologic variables, as well as the sensitivity and resilience of vegetation water content and soil moisture, derived from WindSat, were investigated for different vegetation types during dry spells of varying duration, identified using the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), in 2003-2011. Forest/Woody Savanna (FWS) and Savanna/Grasslands (SG) are more sensitive to local hydrologic extremes, while Shrublands (SHR) and the soils that support it are the least impacted by these conditions. SG and FWS exhibit the highest vegetation water content resilience, whereas soil moisture persistence during dry spells is at its highest in SHR/SG. The environmental variability, illustrated by the spatial patterns of the aforementioned hydrologic properties, can potentially play a role in the enhancement of resilience. This study provides critical insight into the hydro-ecological vulnerability of East Africa using microwave remote sensing, and this information can be used towards advancing management and decision support systems that would improve societal well-being and economic development.

AB There is ongoing interest to develop remote sensing methods for mapping and monitoring the spatial distribution and biomass of mangroves. In this study, we develop a suite of methods to evaluate the combination of Landsat-8, ALOS PALSAR, and SRTM data for mapping spatial distribution of mangrove composition, canopy height, and aboveground biomass in the wide intertidal zones and coastal plains of Mimika district, Papua, Indonesia. Image segmentation followed by visual interpretation of composite PALSAR images was used to delineate mangrove areas, whereas a flexible statistical rule based classification of spectral signatures from Landsat-8 images was used to classify mangrove associations. The overall accuracy of land cover classification was 94.38% with a kappa coefficient of 0.94 when validated with field inventory data and Google Earth images. Mangrove height and aboveground biomass were mapped using the SRTM DEM, which were calibrated with field-measured data via quantile regression models. There was a strong correlation between the SRTM DEM and the 0.98 quantile of field canopy heights (H-.98), which was used to represent the tallest trees in each of 196 10 m radius subplots (r = 0.84 and R-2 = 0.804). Model performance was evaluated through 10,000 bootstrapped simulations, producing a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.0 m for canopy height estimation over 30 m pixels of SRTM data. Quantile regression revealed a relatively strong non-linear relationship between the SRTM derived canopy height model and aboveground biomass measured in 0.5 ha mangrove inventory plots (n = 33, R-2 = 0.46). The model results produced estimates of mean standing biomass of 237.52 +/- 982 Mg/ha in short canopy (Avicennia/Sonneratia) stands to 353.52 +/- 98.43 Mg/ha in mature tall canopy (Rhizophora) dominated forest. The model estimates of mangrove biomass were within 90% confidence intervals of area-weighted biomass derived from field measurements. When validated at the landscape scale, the difference between modeled and measured aboveground mangrove biomass was 3.48% with MAE of 105.75 Mg/ha. These results indicate that the approaches developed here are reliable for mapping and monitoring mangrove composition, height, and biomass over large areas of Indonesia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Land managers and ecologists working in Mediterranean-type ecosystems require information on postfire recovery of shrublands as a means of identifying long-term changes in these sensitive systems. This study evaluates the utility of postfire regrowth trajectories, derived from multi-temporal Landsat satellite surface reflectance imagery, as a basis for estimating postfire recovery of chamise chaparral in southern California. Postfire recovery metrics are applied to time series trajectories of spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) including NDVI, EVI, SAVI, MSAVI, NBR, and NBR2. Shrub fractional cover changes following postfire recovery are estimated at 74 plots using multi date high spatial resolution orthoimagery, enabling stratification of the recovery outcomes. The sensitivity of Landsat-based regrowth trajectories to postfire shrub recovery is assessed by ANOVA statistical testing based on the stratified recovery outcomes. We evaluate several combinations of postfire recovery metrics and SVIs as postfire recovery indicators. We compare SVI trends extending 19 to 29 years postfire with field-collected data on postfire recovery trends reported in previous studies, in order to assess the sensitivity of the SVIs to short and long-term phases of regrowth. The utility and necessity of normalizing SVI time series based on unburned control plots to reduce moisture effects is also evaluated.
   A primary finding is that the Scaled Recovery Metric (SRM), a variant of the Regeneration Index which incorporates the pixel-specific SVI value immediately after fire, is a particularly useful indicator of postfire recovery based on time-sequential SVI trajectories and facilitates inter-site comparisons. Time series of several SVIs (especially NDVI and NBR2) provide statistically significant (p < 0.05) indications of postfire recovery outcomes when post fire recovery metrics are applied; NDVI and NBR2 are also sensitive to the gradual regrowth of chamise up to 12 and 19 years postfire, respectively. Normalization by unburned control plots reduces the correlation of Landsat SVIs with annual precipitation by 25 to 70% and enhances recovery signals, but locating suitable control plots was difficult in many parts of our study area. NBR2 is useful for postfire recovery assessment without normalizing by control plots. This study provides an overview of some advantages, limitations, and technical considerations for using postfire regrowth trajectories from Landsat imagery to assess long-term impacts of fire on chamise chaparral.

AB Over the past century, non-native saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) has expanded into most of riparian zones of the southwestern United States and posed significant threats to the native biotic communities. Repeated monitoring of saltcedar distribution over region-wide geographic areas is urgently essential for conservation agencies to develop cost-effective control strategies. Current studies have mostly concentrated on the mapping of saltcedar distribution with a single remote sensing image acquired during its leaf senescence. Given the phenological variation within saltcedar and the spectral confusion between saltcedar and natives, our ability to detect saltcedar with a single-date image is still limited. The objective of this study was to develop new intra-annual phenology-based strategies to detect exotic saltcedar with monthly time series of Landsat imagery. Several temporal phenology-based detection strategies (i.e., phenological bands, phenological NDVI, and phenological metrics) that could track the intra-annual phenological trajectory of plants were devised. With the proposed detection strategies, crucial months and phenological stages in saltcedar detection were investigated. Results indicated that the proposed strategy of phenological bands could accommodate the phenological variation within saltcedar and improve the classification accuracy significantly. Several phenological stages (e.g., flowering and leaf senescence) were deemed as important in discriminating saltcedar from other riparian plants at the Landsat scale. The proposed strategy was found to be relatively robust to the lack of a single Landsat image. It is concluded that monthly time series of Landsat imagery are promising in facilitating the long-term mapping of saltcedar distribution over extended areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Complex urban environments with diverse urban canyon structures and building materials mixed with human modified green space substantially influence the directional variation in upwelling thermal radiance. The thermal anisotropy at a satellite pixel scale (e.g. 1 km) is hard to quantify with current techniques through airborne observations and modeling. The various anisotropic features over urban and rural surfaces lead to an uncertainty regarding how this anisotropy of land surface temperature (LST) influences estimates of the surface urban heat island (SUHI). We quantify LST anisotropy over Chicago and New York using MODIS LST products during the warm months (May-September) for a 10-year period. The impacts of atmospheric attenuation and daily weather variability on LST are removed in order to isolate the anisotropic signal. We then calculate the anisotropy for different levels of urban land use intensity. The daytime maximum anisotropic effects can be up to 9 K for the most urbanized areas, while the nighttime anisotropic effects are weaker but still discernible. Two anisotropic "hot spot" features are observed during daytime: one corresponds to the sensor-sun geometric effect with a higher proportion of sunlit surface components been seen a given view configuration, and the other occurs when sensor zenith angles are near nadir in the afternoon. Similar anisotropic features between the two cities confirm the broader applicability of our approach, while some unique features specific to each city emphasize that diverse urban surface properties and geographic settings can affect anisotropy. This study is the first of its kind to directly evaluate the influence of directional anisotropy on satellite-retrieved SUHI measurements, demonstrating that anisotropic effects can possibly modify the SUHI as measured with MODIS LST by 2.3 K, which is about 25-50% of the total magnitude of the SUHI over Chicago and New York. Our findings provide a statistical basis for the quantification of satellite-retrieved LST anisotropy over heterogeneous urban environments globally. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Within the framework of the efforts of the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop the most consistent and complete record of surface soil moisture (SSM), this study investigated a statistical approach to retrieve a global and long-term SSM dataset from space-borne observations. More specifically, this study investigated the ability of physically based statistical regressions to retrieve SSM from two passive microwave remote sensing observations: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E; 2003-Sept. 2011) and the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. Regression coefficients were calibrated using AMSR-E horizontal and vertical brightness temperature (TB) observations and SMOS level 3 SSM (SMOSL3; as a training dataset). This calibration process was carried out over the June 2010-Sept. 2011 period, over which both SMOS and AMSR-E observations coincide. Based on these calibrated coefficients, a global SSM product (referred here to as AMSR-reg) was computed from the AMSR-E TB observations during the 2003-2011 period. The regression quality was assessed by evaluating the AMSR-reg SSM product against the SMOSL3 SSM product over the period of calibration, in terms of correlation (R) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). A good agreement (mean global R = 0.60 and mean global RMSE = 0.057 m(3)/m(3)), was obtained between the AMSR-reg and SMOSL3 SSM products particularly over Australia, central USA, central Asia, and the Sahel. In a second step, the AMSR-reg SSM retrievals and commonly used AMSR-E SSM retrievals derived from the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (AMSR-LPRM), were evaluated against two kinds of SSM references (i) the global MERRA-Land SSM simulations and (ii) in situ measurements over 2003-2009. The results demonstrated that both AMSR-reg and AMSR-LPRM (better when considering global simulations) successfully captured the temporal dynamics of the references used having comparable correlation values. AMSR-reg was more consistent with MERRA-land than AMSR-LPRM in terms of unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) with a global average of ubRMSE of 0.055 m(3)/m(3) for AMSR-reg and 0.084 m(3)/m(3) for AMSRLPRM. In conclusion, the statistical regression, which is tested here for the first time using long-term spaceborne TB datasets, appears to be a promising approach for retrieving SSM from passive microwave remote sensing TB observations.

AB Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) measurements, in addition to other data, are used to study the occurrence of salinity fronts in the poorly sampled Indian Ocean, which exhibits unique seasonal wind and current reversals. The strength and extent of salinity fronts are analyzed to understand their variabilities. Salinity fronts computed from SMOS compare favorably with those computed from Argo floats data, with SMOS showing higher magnitudes and more detailed structure of the fronts than Argo. Strong salinity fronts are observed along the equatorial region, with meridional migration of the fronts following the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and meridional ocean currents. Linked with these fronts are less saline subsurface waters that are sustained by the ITCZ-influenced precipitation and warm near-surface layer. During the 2010 negative Indian Ocean Dipole event, the equatorial front was influenced more by the increased SSS along the equator rather than precipitation. Additional factors, such as advective processes, aid the dynamics of fronts in the tropical Indian Ocean. Zonal currents advect less saline waters from the eastern Indian Ocean into the central Indian Ocean. Additionally the Indonesian Throughflow transports less saline waters to the region south of the equator, which eventually influence SSS front dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurately mapping the spatial distribution of tree species in tropical environments provides valuable insights for ecologists and forest managers. This process may play an important role in reducing fieldwork costs, monitoring changes in canopy biodiversity, and locating parent trees to collect seeds for forest restoration efforts. However, mapping tree species in tropical forests with remote sensing data is a challenge because of high floristic and spectral diversity. In this research, we discriminated and mapped tree species in tropical seasonal semi-deciduous forests (Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome) by using airborne hyperspectral and simulated multispectral data in the 450 to 2400 nm wavelength range. After quantifying the spectral variability within and among individual tree crowns of eight species, three supervised machine learning classifiers were applied to discriminate the species at the pixel level. Linear Discriminant Analysis outperformed Support Vector Machines with Linear and Radial Basis Function (RBF-SVMs) kernels and Random Forests in almost all the tested cases. An average classification accuracy of 70% was obtained when using the visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 450-919 nm) bands. The inclusion of shortwave infrared bands (SWIR, 1045-2400 nm) increased the accuracy to 84%. Narrow-band vegetation indices (VIs) were also tested and increased the classification accuracy by up to 5% when combined with VNIR features. Furthermore, the spectral bands of the WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite sensor were simulated for classification purposes. WV-3 VNIR bands provided an accuracy of 57.4%, which increased to 74.8% when using WV-3 SWIR bands. We also tested the production of species maps by using an object-oriented approach that integrated a novel segmentation algorithm that was tailored to delineate tree crowns and label high class membership pixels inside each object. In this scenario, RBF-SVMs produced the best species maps, correctly identifying 84.9% of crowns with hyperspectral data and 78.5% with simulated WV-3 data. The use of a reduced set of hyperspectral bands, which were selected with stepwise regression, did not significantly affect the classification accuracies but allowed us to depict the most important wavelengths to discriminate the species. These wavelengths were located around the green reflectance peak (550 nm), at the red absorption feature (650 nm) and in the SWIR range at 1200,1700, 2100 and 2300 nm. These encouraging results suggest the feasibility of the proposed approach for mapping pioneering and climax tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest Biome, highlighting its potential use in forest recovery and inventory initiatives.

AB The early identification of natural oil seepages or accidental leaks onshore is not a well explored theme in the literature. Location and mapping of contaminated areas can indicate the presence of a subsurface reservoir and guide direct exploration operations in the oil industry. Superficial occurrences of hydrocarbons (HCs) can also indicate damage to pipelines. Locating small leaks can guide containment, cleaning and repair operations. Remote sensing tools for such purposes usually focus on the effects that oil in the soil causes on the spectral signatures of vegetation. Studies investigating the spectral characteristics of soil and HC mixtures are not prevalent. This study comprises the conception and analysis of a spectral library of mixtures of several mineral substrates impregnated with various concentrations of light to heavy oils (API varying from 19.4 to 41.9), using data acquired with an automated hyperspectral imaging station and processed with wavelets. The wavelet transform allowed the extraction of key spectral features and the discard of secondary information (e.g. noise and continuum), resulting in hyperspectral imagery products that proved suitable to separate different phases in the soil-HC mixture, as well as to identify the type and concentration of HC in the soil. This comprehensive spectral library and the acquired information regarding spectral characteristics of soil-hydrocarbon mixtures, opens opportunities for the development of new processing methods for the direct mapping of onshore seeps and leaks using current and future orbital hyperspectral (Hyperion; EnMap; HyspIRI) and multispectral (WordView-3) sensors.

AB The cryosphere consists of frozen water and includes lakes/rivers/sea ice, glaciers, ice caps/sheets, snow cover, and permafrost. Because highly reflective snow and ice are the main components of the cryosphere, it plays an important role in the global energy balance. Thus, any qualitative or quantitative change in the physical properties and extents of the cryosphere affects global air circulation, ocean and air temperatures, sea level, and ocean current patterns. Due to the hardships involved in collecting ground control points and field data for high alpine glaciers or vast polar ice sheets, several researchers are currently using remote sensing. Satellites provide an effective space-borne platform for remotely sensing frozen areas at the global and regional scales. However, satellite remote sensing has several constraints, such as limited spatial and temporal resolutions and expensive data acquisition. Therefore, aerial and terrestrial remote sensing platforms and sensors are needed to cover temporal and spatial gaps for comprehensive cryospheric research. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) antennas form a group of active remote sensors that can easily be deployed on all three platforms, i.e., satellite, aerial, and terrestrial. The generation of elevation data for glacial and snow-covered terrain from photogrammetry requires high contrast amongst various reflective surfaces (ice, snow, firn, and slush). Conventional passive optical remote sensors do not provide the necessary accuracy, especially due to the unavailability of reliable ground control points. However, active LiDAR sensors can fill this research gap and provide high-resolution and accurate Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). Due to the obvious advantages of LiDAR over conventional passive remote sensors, the number of LiDAR-based cryospheric studies has increased in recent years. In this review, we highlight studies that have utilised LiDAR sensors for the cryospheric research of various features, such as snow cover, polar ice sheets and their atmospheres, alpine glaciers, and permafrost. Because this technology shows immense promise for applications in future cryospheric research, we also emphasise the prospects of utilising LiDAR sensors. In this paper, a large compilation of relevant references is presented to allow readers to explore particular topics of interest. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Classification of remotely sensed imagery for land-cover mapping purposes has attracted significant attention from researchers and practitioners. Numerous studies conducted over several decades have investigated a broad array of input data and classification methods. However, this vast assemblage of research results has not been synthesized to provide coherent guidance on the relative performance of different classification processes for generating land cover products. To address this problem, we completed a statistical meta-analysis of the past 15 years of research on supervised per-pixel image classification published in five high-impact remote sensing journals. The two general factors evaluated were classification algorithms and input data manipulation as these are factors that can be controlled by analysts to improve classification accuracy. The meta-analysis revealed that inclusion of texture information yielded the greatest improvement in overall accuracy of land-cover classification with an average increase of 12.1%. This increase in accuracy can be attributed to the additional spatial context information provided by including texture. Inclusion of ancillary data, multi-angle and time images also provided significant improvement in classification overall accuracy, with 8.5%, 8.0%, and 6.9% of average improvements, respectively. In contrast, other manipulation of spectral information such as index creation (e.g. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and feature extraction (e.g. Principal Components Analysis) offered much smaller improvements in accuracy. In terms of classification algorithms, support vector machines achieved the greatest accuracy, followed by neural network methods. The random forest classifier performed considerably better than the traditional decision tree classifier. Maximum likelihood classifiers, often used as benchmarking algorithms, offered low accuracy. Our findings will help guide practitioners to decide which classification to implement and also provide direction to researchers regarding comparative studies that will further solidify our understanding of different classification processes. However, these general guidelines do not preclude an analyst from incorporating personal preferences or considering specific algorithmic benefits that may be pertinent to a particular application.

AB Information on the spatial and temporal patterns of plant phenology is important to develop a more comprehensive understanding of food availability and habitat for many animal species. The combination of broad scale, regional climatic, and more localized, site-level drivers presents a challenge when upscaling phenology from the plot to the region. Likewise, developing relationships between ground- or camera-based estimates and satellite imagery remains difficult due to the trade-off between temporal and spatial resolution. Landsat imagery, with its 16 day temporal resolution, is often thought of as being insufficient for timely observation of changes in vegetation throughout the year. However the free availability of the Landsat archive has enabled a major shift in the way Landsat imagery is processed moving towards pixel, rather than scene, based analyses. In this paper we build on previous research by examining the applicability and accuracy of Landsat derived phonology curves beyond deciduous stands into more mixed stands and conifer dominated forest types in the Rocky Mountains and foothills in Alberta, Canada. In addition, we discuss the application of these Landsat phenology curves to phenology of understorey species which are linked to habitat selection for free roaming wildlife, in particular grizzly bears. The agreement between Landsat- and camera-derived estimates of key phonological events was stronger for green up (RMSE = 7 days) than for senescence (RMSE = 14 days). Our results show that yearly adjustment of green-up and senescence dates using available Landsat observations improved the agreement with camera-derived estimates when compared to average annual curves. Seasonal phonology transition dates accepted as valid ranged from 25% for alpine herbaceous pixels to 75% for closed deciduous, demonstrating the variable success of this approach across land cover types. Season transition dates were rejected if pixels lacked a strong enough green up signal in Landsat spectral indices or if the estimated dates fell outside of the valid range. We conclude by investigating the spatial patterns of seasonal phenology at the Landsat scale, and assess the relative importance of regional vs. microsite conditions as well as the utility of these data for resource and wildlife management.

AB Leaf area is an important forest structural variable which serves as the primary means of mass and energy exchange within vegetated ecosystems. The objective of the current study was to determine if leaf area index (LAI) could be estimated accurately and consistently in five intensively managed pine plantation forests using two multiple-return airborne LiDAR datasets. Field measurements of LAI were made using the LiCOR LAI2000 and LAI2200 instruments within 116 plots were established of varying size and within a variety of stand conditions (i.e. stand age, nutrient regime and stem density) in North Carolina and Virginia in 2008 and 2013. A number of common LiDAR return height and intensity distribution metrics were calculated (e.g. average return height), in addition to ten indices, with two additional variants, utilized in the surrounding literature which have been used to estimate LAI and fractional cover, were calculated from return heights and intensity, for each plot extent. Each of the indices was assessed for correlation with each other, and was used as independent variables in linear regression analysis with field LAI as the dependent variable. All LiDAR derived metrics were also entered into a forward stepwise linear regression. The results from each of the indices varied from an R-2 of 0.33 (S.E. 0.87) to 0.89 (S.E. 0.36). Those indices calculated using ratios of all returns produced the strongest correlations, such as the Above and Below Ratio Index (ABRI) and Laser Penetration Index 1 ( LPI1). The regression model produced from a combination of three metrics did not improve correlations greatly (R-2 0.90; S.E. 0.35). The results indicate that LAI can be predicted over a range of intensively managed pine plantation forest environments accurately when using different LiDAR sensor designs. Those indices which incorporated counts of specific return numbers (e.g. first returns) or return intensity correlated poorly with field measurements. There were disparities between the number of different types of returns and intensity values when comparing the results from two LiDAR sensors, indicating that predictive models developed using such metrics are not transferable between datasets with different acquisition parameters. Each of the indices were significantly correlated with one another, with one exception (LAI proxy), in particular those indices calculated from all returns, which indicates similarities in information content for those indices. It can then be argued that LiDAR indices have reached a similar stage in development to those calculated from optical-spectral sensors, but which offer a number of advantages, such as the reduction or removal of saturation issues in areas of high biomass.

AB The relationship between land use and land cover (LULC) patterns and thermal characteristic has long been studied for examining the impact of urbanization on urban thermal environment Previous studies were inclined to the use of one or a few images without fully considering the temporal domain of the reflective and thermal infrared data on board Landsat sensors. This paper took the Atlanta metropolitan area as a case study to illustrate LULC change and its impact on land surface temperature (1ST) variations. The Landsat LIT (Standard terrain correction) images from TM/ETM + from 1984 to 2011 (507 in total) were downloaded through the USGS online portal and consistently calibrated to surface reflectance and brightness temperature (BT). The cloud-, cloud shadow-, and snow-contaminated pixels were excluded in the analysis according to the metadata, and a further screening procedure based on the RIRLS (Robust Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares) technique was implemented. The time series LSTs (TSLSTs) was derived using the single channel algorithm because it required only the parameters of water vapor and land surface emissivity and had a reported error close to 1 K. The LULC classification and change detection was accomplished by using the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. The TSLSTs were further decomposed into the seasonal and trend components by an additive model. Results showed that the overall LULC classification and change detection accuracies were 89% and 92%, respectively. Urban growth was mainly observed in Fulton County and Gwinnett County. High-intensity urban land had the largest mean 1ST value of 294.9 K and yearly amplitude of 17.4 K. A comparison of the trend component between urban and non-urban land covers showed a difference of 1.8 K per decade. Next, temporal thermal signatures were created to characterize and quantify the impact of urban LULC changes. Decomposition analysis showed that the conversion of evergreen forest to medium-intensity urban land generated the largest difference in annual LST variation (5.7 K) and the largest trend difference (0.0004 K/day).

AB To understand the land surface changes that Central Asia experienced between 2001 and 2013, we applied a non-parametric change analysis method to the standard vegetation indices (NDVI and EVI), as well as to the MODIS Tasseled Cap indices Brightness, Greenness and Wetness. In addition, we evaluated the MODIS nighttime and daytime land surface temperature products and the MODIS evapotranspiration product. We compared the change results by country, land cover type, and anthropogenic biome, and we also evaluated the results according to an index of human influence (HII). We found that EVI, NDVI and Tasseled Cap Greenness reveal very similar changes (r > 0.8), while there was a much lower correlation between the vegetation indices and results based on other portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Thus, we found it informative to expand the analysis beyond the optical and near infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, into the thermal regions. We found that the majority of the changes occurred in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, while Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan appeared more stable during this period. The observed changes were attributable to a combination of anthropogenic changes and weather effects. For example, changes in crop type south of the Aral Sea were revealed as increases in vegetation indices but declines in evapotranspiration, resulting from a shift from cotton to wheat. Across Kazakhstan large patches of negative vegetation changes, combined with increasing temperatures and declines in evapotranspiration were attributable to persistent droughts. Generally, we found that most browning of vegetation occurred in areas with lower human influence (except for areas with very high human influence) and most greening of the vegetation occurred in the areas with intermediate human influence. The use of multiple indicators of significant trends improved trend interpretation and attribution of proximate causes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing of leaf biochemicals is critical for understanding many biochemical processes. Leaf biochemical contents (e.g., protein, cellulose and lignin) in fresh and dry leaves have been quantified from hyperspectral data using empirical models. However, they cannot be retrieved for fresh leaves by inverting radiative transfer models. We demonstrated the applicability of PROSPECT leaf optical properties model in the separation of specific absorption coefficients for protein and cellulose + lignin following a newly proposed algorithm, and evaluated the feasibility in estimating leaf protein and cellulose + lignin content through model inversion. Assessment was performed across a large variety of plant species benefiting from the Leaf Optical Properties Experiment (LOPEX) dataset. To alleviate ill-posed problems, inversion was performed over different spectral subsets. The PROSPECT model with newly calibrated specific absorption coefficients was able to accurately reconstruct leaf reflectance and transmittance. Leaf protein and cellulose + lignin were estimated at moderate to good accuracies for both fresh and dry leaves. The spectral subset of 2100-2300 nm yielded the most accurate estimation of leaf cellulose + lignin (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 5.21E-04 g/cm(2)) and protein (R-2 = 0.47, RMSE = 2.75E 04 g/cm(2)) in fresh leaves, which were comparable with those obtained from stepwise multiple linear regressions (protein: R-2 = 0.83, RMSE = 3.91E 04 g/cm(2); cellulose + lignin: R-2 = 0.66, RMSE = 2.02E 04 g/cm(2)). Our results confirm the importance of selecting a proper spectral subset that contains sufficient information for a successful inversion. For the first time, we provide promising estimations of leaf protein in fresh leaves through inversion of a radiative transfer model, which can be applied at canopy level for regional mapping if coupled with a canopy reflectance model and air- or space-borne hyperspectral imaging.

AB Despite advances in data collection and analytical software, mapping of glacial geomorphology is still largely achieved through manual techniques. Manual mapping is a relatively slow, inefficient and potentially subjective process, particularly given the extensive spatial coverage of remotely sensed datasets. Thus, glacial geomorphic mapping would benefit from semi-automated techniques able to map large areas quickly and efficiently. Here, we develop novel semi-automated techniques for mapping glacial geomorphology, based on lidar derived data collected from Brei partial derivative amerkurjokull, Iceland using Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA). The landforms classified were moraines, eskers, flutes/drumlins, and glacio-fluvial outwash. Several land surface parameters (LSPs) were calculated during image segmentation and analysis, representing the characteristics of the landforms of interest. The segmentation and classification routines were developed in Matlab, whereas most attempts so far have used specialised OBIA software. Our techniques utilised exploratory data analysis, where statistical groupings within the data define different landform types. Accuracy was assessed against a reference map derived using traditional manual mapping techniques. Landforms were classified to an overall accuracy of 77%. Our semi-automated mapping techniques should, with further algorithm development, be applicable using other datasets commonly used in palaeo-glaciology such as radar derived elevation data and swath bathymetry.

AB As a way to understand vegetation changes, trend analysis on NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) time series data have been widely performed at regional to global scales. However, most long-term NDVI datasets are based upon multiple sensor systems and unsuccessful corrections related to sensor shifts potentially introduce substantial uncertainties and artifacts in the analysis of trends. The temporal consistency of NDVI datasets should therefore be evaluated before performing trend analysis to obtain reliable results. In this study we analyze the temporal consistency of multi-sensor NDVI time series by analyzing the co-occurrence between breaks in the NDVI time series and sensor shifts from GIMMS3g (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies 3rd generation), VIP3 (Vegetation Index and Phenology version 3), LTDR4 (Long Term Data Record version 4) and SPOT-VGT (Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre VEGETATION). Single sensor time series from MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra and Aqua are used as reference datasets. The global land surface is divided into six regions according to the world humidity zones and averaged NDVI time series in each region are analyzed separately using a multiple structural change detection approach. We find that artifacts exist in the VIP3 and LTDR4 NDVI datasets with an abrupt shift detected in all humidity zones coinciding with the shift from NOAA-9 to NOAA-11 in 1988 and that orbital drift effects are evident in arid regions, potentially introducing uncertainties in NDVI trend analysis. Platform/sensor change from VGT-1 to VGT-2 is found to cause a significant positive break in the SPOT-VGT NDVI time series. Potential artifacts exist in humid, dry-subhumid, semi-arid and hyper-arid regions of GIMMS3g NDVI, whereas no signs of artifacts are found in the arid region. Although temporal consistency throughout all examined datasets increases after 2000 due to the usage of advanced platforms and sensors, variations in NDVI values from 2010 to 2011 still result in different trends at global and regional scales.

AB The Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF) has been producing full resolution global Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from the METOP-A Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) since July 2007. The SST operational processing and the validation scheme have remained unchanged for more than 6 years. The global validation results against measurements are stable over time. Night-time METOP-A SSTs differ from drifting buoy SSTs by -0.05 K in average with a standard deviation of 0.44 K and the daytime values are respectively 0.09 K and 056 K.
   Seasonal statistics have been calculated on a global regular 5-degree grid for a 6-year period to review the main biases and their characteristics. There is evidence of regional and seasonal biases, indeed the multispectral regression algorithms are known (to a various degree depending upon specific implementation) to have limitations in handling the variety of atmospheric absorption conditions encountered over the global ocean. This problem has been solved for the OSI SAP geostationary SST chain by adopting a Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) profile based correction method. The same approach has been tested on a prototype chain ingesting METOP-A data and gives encouraging results. It will be used in the new polar orbiter chain under development at OSI SAF, that will process METOP-B data.
   An application example of METOP-A SST time series is given by analyzing the inter-annual variability of Arctic Ocean SST in relation with the ice coverage variability in September. The METOP-A time series gives consistent results when compared to other observations or model outputs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is one of the most promising remote sensors to map forest carbon. The unique spaceborne and long-wavelength SAR data currently available are L-band data, but their relationship with forest biomass is still controversial, particularly for high biomass values. While many studies assume a complete loss of sensitivity above a saturation point, typically around 100 t.ha(-1), others assume a continuous positive correlation between SAR backscatter and biomass. The objective of this paper is to revisit the relationship between L-band SAR backscatter and dense tropical forest biomass for a large range of biomass values using both theoretical and experimental approaches. Both approaches revealed that after reaching a maximum value, SAR backscatter correlates negatively with forest biomass. This phenomenon is interpreted as a signal attenuation from the forest canopy as the canopy becomes denser with increasing biomass. This result has strong implications for L-band vegetation mapping because it can lead to a greater-than-expected under-estimation of biomass. The consequences for L-band biomass mapping are illustrated, and solutions are proposed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In the Laurentian Great Lakes, the prolific growth of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV, dominated by the filamentous green alga Cladophora) is negatively impacting human and wildlife health, fisheries, and aesthetic conditions. The distribution of Cladophora and similar SAV in the Great Lakes and how that has changed over recent decades has been unknown, and the magnitude of the current problem relative to historic growth is difficult to assess given the lack of field data and monitoring. Here, we present the first comprehensive map of SAV in the nearshore zone of the lower four Great Lakes, where 'nearshore' indicates the zone where the bottom reflectance is sufficient to characterize bottom substrate type, using primarily the visible bands of the Landsat TM sensor. Multiple spectral bands were combined to minimize the water-depth-dependent variance in lake bottom reflectance, and pixels were classified as dense vegetation, sparse vegetation or uncolonized substrate. Changes in vegetation cover and water clarity between the mid-1970s and present were also evaluated for several focus areas across the lakes utilizing historical Landsat TM and MSS-imagery. The Landsat-based bottom classification achieved an overall accuracy of 83% based on comparison to ground truth data. Lake-wide SAV cover ranged from 15% (Lake Huron) to 40% (Lake Ontario) of the mappable lake bottom based on detection depth. The total mapped area of vegetation corresponds to a conservative biomass estimate of 129 kilotonnes dry weight. The observed changes in the distribution of SAV over time indicate that increasing water clarity in the Lakes is expanding Cladophora habitat. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate leaf area index (LAI) measurements are important for understanding and evaluating global mass and energy cycle. Foliage clumping serves an important function in traditional indirect LAI measurement methods. The clumping index has been used to modify effective LAI for decades. However, the change in path length within canopies is often the most uncertain factor in indirect LAI estimation using Beefs law. A simple clumping index is incapable of describing the heterogeneity of a canopy and may cause large errors in calculating true LAI values. We proposed a new LAI estimation method by using path length distribution functions in optical measurement. Both simulation and field measurements show that the path length-based method can effectively characterize the LAI values of heterogeneous canopies. Deviation is less than 10% for all the validations. One of the advantages of path length distribution theory is that it can characterize and handle crown shape-induced non-randomness within canopies. Such non-randomness, which may cause underestimation of up to 25%, has not been well addressed by existing algorithms. Path length theory is expected to improve the indirect measurement accuracy of LAI significantly with the use of current optical instruments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Xi'an, China has been undergoing significant land subsidence along with ground fissure development. These geohazards have brought about severe damages to buildings, bridges and other facilities. In order to warn of and mitigate disasters, it is urgently necessary to obtain the latest rate, extent, and temporal evolution of land subsidence in Xi'an. With multiple SAR datasets as well as leveling, GPS and ground water level of aquifers, we study and map the spatial and temporal evolution of land subsidence and ground fissures over Xi'an. First, 62 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by Envisat, ALOS, and TerrSAR-X during 2005-2012 are used to form three independent interferometric stacks to unveil the spatial and temporal variations of land subsidence and ground fissures by using the time-series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique. GPS and leveling measurements are applied to calibrate the InSAR results. Precision of our InSAR annual subsidence results is less than 9 mm. We derive the east-west and vertical components of the observed land deformation in 2009 using descending and ascending InSAR observations, finding out that the horizontal component of land deformation cannot be ignored if the deformation is large or ground fissures are active. Second, four main land subsidence zones are detected in Xi'an, with an average subsidence rate of 50 mm/a during 2005-2012. Time-series InSAR results indicate that land subsidence rates in Xi'an increased by 200% from 2005-2007 to 2008-2010, extending existing ground fissures. Third, InSAR-derived land subsidence correlates with the change in ground water level, and seasonal variations in subsidence correlate with changes in ground water pumping. Last, the consistency on the spatial-temporal distribution variation between ground fissures and land subsidence could be drawn from the time series results and profile analysis. Shapes of subsiding zones follow the general trends of mapped ground fissures and main faults in an ENE direction. Changes in the subsidence gradient are also observed over most of the ground fissures and faults. Subsidence-triggered fissures can cause localized surface displacements, aggravate localized subsidence, discontinue the integrity of ground water flow, and limit the horizontal spread of subsidence funnels. With continuing mass construction projects in Xi'an, monitoring ground deformation with satellite InSAR therefore can provide efficient means to image land subsidence, movements of fissures and faults, and the associated geohazards.

AB Herbaceous salt marshes are among the most productive ecosystems on earth. Unfortunately, quantification of the above-ground portion of biomass using passive optical remote sensing is constrained by the complexities of mixed spectral appearance in the water land environment. Lidar remote sensing, on the other hand, has been extensively used to estimate forest biomass, and a few studies have reported their use in characterizing short or herbaceous plants. However, no empirical studies have demonstrated the combined use of lidar and spectral data to quantify above-ground biomass in herbaceous environments, including salt marshes. Thus, the findings of this study will contribute substantially to the understanding of potentials and limitations of using lidar and multi-spectral data for vegetation characterization and biomass estimates in salt marshes and other similar herbaceous environments. In this study, we evaluate the increased capability of a data fusion approach using small footprint discrete return lidar and multispectral data to quantify above-ground biomass and thus, carbon stocks in salt marshes. The specific objectives of our study were the following: 1) to understand the interaction between discrete-return airborne lidar and marsh vegetation; 2) to determine the appropriate grid size/s of lidar-derived datasets for characterizing marsh terrain and vegetation; 3) to investigate the applicability of a number of lidar metrics to predict salt marsh vegetation height and above-ground biomass; and 4) to evaluate the utility of integrating multispectral imagery with lidar to improve the predictability of regression models for quantifying above-ground biomass and carbon. Our results showed that salt marsh Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) derived using local minima in a grid spacing of 5 m x 5 m provided the best accuracy in terrain elevation estimates with an RMSE of less than 10 cm. Lidar-derived maximum vegetation heights (Lmax) provided the best agreement with field height measurements, but explained only 41% of the variance in vegetation height measurements (RMSE = 5.85 cm). Regardless of the metrics used, lidar-measured heights underestimated the field vegetation height, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies in short or herbaceous vegetation. The fusion of lidar with multispectral data improved model predictions of live, dead, and total biomass quantities. The improvement provided by the fusion over the use of lidar or multispectral data alone was marginal; the combination explained 47% of the variance, whereas the best models using lidar and multispectral data separately explained 37% and 28% of variances in live biomass measurements, respectively. However, the best biomass prediction models reported considerably low RMSEs and % root square errors (%RSEs). For example, %RSE for the biomass prediction model using lidar-derived maximum vegetation height (Lmax) was closer to 20%, which is the recommended error threshold for remote sensing based forest biomass prediction models that can be repeatedly applicable for estimating forest carbon stock change. Our findings also demonstrate that lidar as compared to spectral data can provide better estimates of above-ground biomass and carbon, even in the herbaceous and low-relief context of a salt marsh.

AB Globally, irrigation accounts for more than two thirds of freshwater demand. Despite their importance, the geographic distribution and water use of many important irrigated areas remains uncertain. This paper advances a methodology to map summer cropping irrigated areas experiencing extreme climate and different management practices in the Murray-Darling Basin (Australia). A Random Forest classification model was implemented to austral hemisphere summer irrigated areas for the water-years 2004/05 to 2010/11. The methodology used training samples from Landsat TM/ETM + reflectance data and monthly time-series of remotely-sensed observations from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The covariates included in the classification model characterised the monthly dynamics and rates of change of: (i) the vegetation phenology via the recurrent and persistent absorbed fractions of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR(rec), and fPAR(per), respectively); (ii) water use via remotely-sensed estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ETa), precipitation (P) and the difference between ETa and P. Observed agreement - in terms of the kappa coefficient - for correctly classified pixels in the training sample was 96%. Independent comparisons of yearly irrigated area estimates showed linear relationships with Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) generally greater than 0.7 for: (i) reported areas; (ii) areas with available metered water withdrawals; and (iii) estimates of agricultural yields. Sequential covariate optimisation suggested that the most important predictors to identify of irrigation areas included the emergence-senescence period (as determined by the fPAR(rec) and corresponding rates of change) and the ETa surplus over P during this period. The latter can be important when identifying supplementary irrigation due to periodically unreliable water supply in areas with otherwise high precipitation that are in-phase with summer crop growth.

AB Error characterisation of satellite-retrieved soil moisture (SM) is crucial for maximizing their utility in research and applications in hydro-meteorology and climatology. It can provide insights for retrieval development and validation, and inform suitable strategies for data fusion and assimilation. Su et al. (2013a) proposed a potential Fourier method for quantifying the errors based on the difference between the empirical power spectra of these SM data and a water balance model via spectral fitting (SF), circumventing the need for any ancillary data This work first evaluates its utility by estimating the errors in two passive and active microwave satellite SM over Australia, and comparing the results against the triple collocation (TC) estimator. The SF estimator shows very good agreement with TC in terms of error standard deviation and signal-to-noise ratio, with strong linear correlations of 0.80-0.92 but with lower error estimates. As the two estimators are not strictly comparable, their strong agreement suggests a strong complementarity between time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of errors. A better understanding of the spectral characteristics of the error is still needed to understand their differences. Next, spatial analyses of the derived (SF and TC) error maps, in terms of error standard deviation and noise-to-signal ratio, for the two satellite data are performed with principal component analysis to identify influence of vegetation/leaf-area index (LAI), rainfall, soil wetness, and spatial heterogeneity in topography and soil type on retrieval errors. Lastly, seasonal analysis of the errors discovers systematic temporal variability in errors due to variability in rainfall amount, and less so with changing LAI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB An effective Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) based on real viewing geometry and encompassing a wide range of aerosol conditions and types (omega(0) = 030-1.0) was tested over Beijing, a city under the influence of both anthropogenic emissions and dust storms. The SARA AOD was retrieved at seven resolutions (500 m, 1 km, 2 km, 4 km, 6 km, 8 km, and 10 km) using MODIS level 1 and 2 data products (MOD02, MOD03, and MOD09) for the years 2012 and 2013. For comparison purposes, the MODIS dark-target (DT) AOD observations at 10 km resolution were obtained for the same time period. Both algorithms, SARA and MODIS DT were validated using Beijing_RADI and Beijing_CAMS AERONET AOD measurements and accuracy was evaluated using the Confidence Envelope of Expected Error (CEEE). The SARA AOD achieved very high correlation (0.972-0.994) with low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE similar to 0.067-0.133) and very high accuracy (87-95%). In comparison, the MODIS DT algorithm overestimated AOD for both low and high AOD observations with large RMSE (0.115-0342) and very low accuracy (20-52%). The robustness and accuracy of SARA and the MODIS DT algorithms for low (ADD < 0.40) and high (AOD > 0.40) aerosol loadings was evaluated using the Fraction of Expected Error (FEE). The SARA algorithm achieved 46-60% higher average accuracy than the MODE DT algorithm indicating SARA's greater accuracy and reliability in AOD retrieval over Beijing under low and high aerosol loadings, including severe dust storms. The SARA algorithm is unique among satellite based AOD retrievals, in its ability to depict extreme dust storms (AOD similar to 5.0) at fine spatial resolution (500 m) over urban and suburban areas such as Beijing, XiangHe and the Bohai Sea, as is demonstrated by the dust storm of 17th April 2006.

AB We estimated aboveground tree biomass and change in aboveground tree biomass using repeated airborne laser scanner (ALS) acquisitions and temporally coincident ground observations of forest biomass, for a relatively undisturbed period (2004-2007; Delta(07-04)), a contrasting period of disturbance (2007-2009; Delta(09-07)), and an integrated period (2004-2009; Delta(09-04)). A simple random sampling (SRS) estimator was used to estimate means and variances of biomass and biomass change for each measurement occasion and interval. For each year, linear regression models were used to predict mean total aboveground tree biomass for live, dead, and total biomass components from ALS-derived variables. These models predicted biomass with R-2 = 0.68, 0.59, and 0.70 and RMSEs of 32.7, 30.5, and 31.7 Mg ha(-1) for 2004, 2007 and 2009, respectively. A model assisted indirect estimator was then used to estimate biomass and biomass change for comparison to the field-based SRS estimator. This model assisted indirect approach decreased standard errors of biomass estimation relative to the SRS estimator, but had larger variances for biomass change estimation. Linear regression models were also used to directly predict field-estimated biomass change using ALS A-variables, calculated as the difference between multi-temporal ALS variables, for the study area. Integrated over the 6 year period, these change models had R-2 = 0.81, 0.72, and 0.68 with RMSEs of 2.0, 93, and 1.0 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for live, dead, and total aboveground tree biomass, respectively. A model assisted direct estimator reduced standard errors of change estimates by 100-200% compared to the field-based estimates. We discuss several potential advantages and limitations of the direct and indirect approaches. Our primary finding is that model assisted direct estimation of biomass change decreased estimation uncertainty relative to both field and model assisted indirect estimation.

AB Fire, insects, and human activities are the dominant drivers of forest disturbance at the global scale. Because forests are geographically extensive and are often remote, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is uniquely suited to monitor the state and health of forested ecosystems. However, the extent to which coarse-resolution remote sensing data can accurately capture spatial and temporal patterns of disturbance is unclear. To investigate this, we developed an 11-year time series of MODIS Normalized Burn Ratio images corresponding to peak-growing season conditions for a study area located in the Pacific Northwest of the conterminous United States. Using a temporal segmentation algorithm that was originally developed using Landsat TM and ETM data, we created annual maps of forest disturbance from these time series. We then compared these maps to a database of annual forest disturbance that was compiled using Landsat TM/ETM data for the same region. Results film this comparison revealed that about half of all pixels affected by disturbances that occupied more than 5% of a MODIS pixel were correctly identified as disturbed, including 79% of those that were affected by disturbances larger than one-third of a MODIS pixel. Our results also show that the size, severity, and timing of disturbance events, along with gridding artifacts inherent to MODIS data, interact in complex ways that influence the signature of forest disturbance events in MODIS data. These results demonstrate both the utility as well as the limitations of MODIS and other coarse spatial resolution sensors for monitoring forest disturbance at regional to global scales.

AB The modeling of diurnal land surface temperature (LST) is crucial to extend the temporally discrete satellite thermal observations in application to detect the surface property (such as thermal inertia) and fluxes (such as soil heat flux and evapotranspiration) that are important to climate change studies. This paper proposed a generic framework (GEM) for modeling the LST dynamics in clear-sky periods. This was performed by modeling the ground-surface heat flux, which was then transformed into temperature using the surface energy balance and heat conduction equation. Three terms of fluxes were incorporated into GEM, including the nonhomogeneous term depicting the approximate upward flux, the harmonic term representing the approximate solar radiation, and the residue term involving the surplus atmosphere-related flux variations. In a single diurnal temperature cycle (DTC), we derived seven cases of the GEM, i.e., from the GEM-I to -VII, in which two to twelve controlling parameters are required. These controlling parameters are taken as unknowns in backward inversion using temporally discrete surface temperatures. Validations were performed using in-situ brightness temperatures, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) LSTs. The results show that the accuracy generally increases from GEM-I to -VII, with the mean absolute error decreasing from 1.71 to 0.33 degrees C. Particularly, GEM-II and -III can be used to normalize the four MODIS LSTs in a DTC without additional information required; and GEM-VI and -VII are useful once high accuracy is required. Further modeling also indicates that GEM is capable of interpolating LSTs under nonstandard cases with arbitrary starting time, duration length, and local latitude. We consider this study could provide practitioners more options within particular applications for modeling the temperature dynamics under diverse requirements of modeling accuracy and controlling parameter number.

AB Freshwater resources are deteriorating rapidly due to human activities and climate change. Remote sensing techniques have shown potential for monitoring water quality in shallow inland lakes, especially in data-scarce areas. The purpose of this study was to determine the spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient (K-d(lambda)) of the water column, in order to map the euphotic depth (Z(eu)) of Lake Naivasha, Kenya using the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). Intensive in situ radiometric and limnological data collection was undertaken at Lake Naivasha. Atmospheric correction was done on the MERIS images using MERIS Neural Network algorithms, Case 2 Waters (C2R) and Eutrophic Lakes processors and the bright pixel atmospheric correction algorithm (BPAC). The Eutrophic Lakes processor gave the most accurate atmospherically corrected remote sensing reflectances at 490 nm compared to the other processors, with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 47% and a root mean square error (RMSE) 43%, with BPAC giving negative reflectances in the blue spectral range. In situ Kd and Z(eu) models were calibrated and validated using above-and under-water radiometric measurements, and tested on the Neural Network atmospheric correction processed MERIS images. The Eutrophic Lakes estimates were the most accurate, with an RMSE of 0.26 m(-1) and MAPE of 18% for K-d(490) and RMSE of 0.17 m and MAPE of 14% for Z(eu). The Z(eu) maps produced from MERIS images clearly show the variation of euphotic depth both in space and time. These results indicate the suitability of MERIS to monitor euphotic depth and other water quality parameters of shallow inland water bodies. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A number of applications rely on the availability of high resolution TIR data, both in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, as well as in terms of spectral configuration. A consensus exists among the thermal community regarding the lack of such a kind of data, since only one operational sensor is currently providing multispectral TIR data at high spatial resolution (the case of ASTER, at 90 m spatial resolution and a 16-day revisit time). In this paper we propose a minimum multispectral configuration to allow the retrieval of both land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity (epsilon) from thermal infra-red (TIR) data. For this purpose, we propose a minimum configuration based on three TIR bands at around 8.9, 10.6 and 12.0 mu m, which allows the application of two-channel (or split-window) algorithms as well as the application of a temperature and emissivity separation (TES) method (or a combination of both) for LST retrieval. Results presented in this paper are based on studies performed for different candidate missions, but most of the presented results can be also valid in other contexts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB The heterogeneity in phytoplankton production in the North Atlantic after the spring bloom is poorly understood. We analysed merged microwave and infrared satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data and ocean colour phytoplankton size class biomass, primary production (PP) and new production (ExP) derived from SeaWiFS data, to assess the spatial and temporal frequency of surface thermal fronts and areas of enhanced PP and ExP. Strong and persistent surface thermal fronts occurred at the Reykjanes Ridge (RR) and sub-polar front (SPF), which sustain high PP and ExP and, outside of the spring bloom, account for 9% and 15% of the total production in the North Atlantic. When normalised by area, PP at the SPF is four times higher than the RR. Analysis of 13 years of satellite ocean colour data from SeaWiFS, and compared with MODIS-Aqua and MERIS, showed that there was no increase in Chla from 1998 to 2002, which then decreased in all areas from 2002 to 2007 and was most pronounced in the RR. These time series also illustrated that the SPF exhibited the highest PP and the lowest variation in Chia over the ocean colour record. This implies that the SPF provides a high and consistent supply of carbon to the benthos irrespective of fluctuations in the North Atlantic Oscillation.

AB Ocean colour sensors have been capturing the state of the world's oceans for over a decade. They are typically installed on polar-orbiting satellites and cover the entire earth every 1 to 2 days. This temporal resolution is insufficient to observe oceanic processes occurring at a higher frequency, especially when taking cloud cover into account. Data from geostationary platforms can be obtained with a much better temporal resolution (images every 15 or 60 min), and thus are useful to study those processes. We show that by synergistically combining marine reflectance data from SEVIRI, a geostationary sensor, and MODIS Aqua, a polar orbiter, the resulting product is an improvement over both data sources. The synergy approach takes the reflectance from MODIS, with high quality and high spatial resolution, and modulates this over the day by the temporal variability of the SEVIRI reflectance, normalized to the SEVIRI reflectance at the time of MODIS overpass. The temporal frequency of the synergy product is much better than that of MODIS, and by using the latter's high quality data, the limited spatial and radiometric resolution of SEVIRI is enhanced. As the SEVIRI data is limited to a single broad red band (560-710 nm), the applications of the synergy product are limited to parameters that can be derived from this band, such as suspended particulate matter (SPM), turbidity (T) and the diffuse attenuation of photosynthetically available radiation (Kpar) in turbid waters. A geostationary ocean colour sensor over Europe will provide invaluable data concerning our marine environment. The cost of increasing the spatial resolution of a geostationary sensor is very high, and this study illustrates that a lower resolution geostationary ocean colour sensor combined with a high resolution polar orbiting sensor, can provide a high frequency synergetic product with high spatial resolution.

AB Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology has the potential to radically alter the way researchers and managers collect data on wildlife-habitat relationships. To date, the technology has fostered several novel approaches to characterizing avian habitat, but has been limited by the lack of detailed LiDAR-habitat attributes relevant to species across a continuum of spatial grain sizes and habitat requirements. We demonstrate a novel three-step approach for using LiDAR data to evaluate habitat based on multiple habitat attributes and accounting for their influence at multiple grain sizes using federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW; Picoides borealis) foraging habitat data from the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, USA First, we used high density LiDAR data (10 returns/m(2)) to predict detailed forest attributes at 20-m resolution across the entire SRS using a complementary application of nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression and multiple linear regression models. Next, we expanded on previous applications of LiDAR by constructing 95% joint prediction confidence intervals to quantify prediction error at various spatial aggregations and habitat thresholds to determine a biologically and statistically meaningful grain size. Finally, we used aggregations of 20-m cells and associated confidence interval boundaries to demonstrate a new approach to produce maps of RCW foraging habitat conditions based on the guidelines described in the species' recovery plan. Predictive power (R-2) of regression models developed to populate raster layers ranged from 034 to 0.81, and prediction error decreased as aggregate size increased, but minimal reductions in prediction error were observed beyond 0.64-ha (4 x 4 20-m cells) aggregates. Mapping habitat quality while accounting for prediction error provided a robust method to determine the potential range of habitat conditions and specific attributes that were limiting in terms of the amount of suitable habitat. The sequential steps of our analytical approach provide a useful framework to extract detailed and reliable habitat attributes for a forest-dwelling habitat specialist, broadening the potential to apply LiDAR in conservation and management of wildlife populations.

AB An iron fertilization experiment conducted during the summer of 2012 dumped over 100 tons of an ironcontaining substance into surface waters of a Haida eddy in the eastern North Pacific to stimulate a large phytoplankton bloom. Announced as a privately funded ocean fertilization effort to increase salmon returns, it attracted considerable press coverage, caused much public controversy and has been widely denounced by the science community. Here, we use available satellite bio-optical measurements from the MODIS/Aqua instrument and AVISO altimeter dynamic height data to examine the timing, magnitude and extent of this artificial iron fertilization experiment, comparing it with natural fertilization events such as volcanic ash deposition and mesascale eddy transport in the Gulf of Alaska. With respect to other Haida eddies over the past 10 years, this event produced the highest chlorophyll concentrations observed late (>400 days) in eddy life history, produced the strongest bloom ever observed in an eddy in late-summer and induced this late-summer bloom earlier in the season than any other eddy. With respect to the local area of the fertilization, this experiment induced the most intensive phytoplanlcton bloom of the past 10 years, similar to 2x stronger than that caused by Kasatochi volcano in 2008, similar to 5 x that typically observed in the region, including any induced by passing eddies of previous years. Due to its limited spatial and temporal scales, however, estimated total annual carbon drawdown over the Gulf of Alaska by this experiment is one order of magnitude smaller than the Kasatochi volcano and mesoscale Haida eddies. The target eddy followed a path typical of previous Haida eddies, but with relatively weak dynamic height and rotational circulation. Satellite-based calculations also suggest that only a small fraction of the dumped iron might have been taken up by phytoplankton. The extent to which this localized experiment may impact higher trophic levels such as salmon remains uncertain. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Alps represent an extremely complex environment in which snow properties suffer dramatic spatial variations that cannot easily be followed by space-borne microwave radiometers, due to their coarse spatial resolution: some studies demonstrated that the algorithms developed for global scale monitoring of the snow depth (SD) are unable to retrieve this parameter with a satisfactory accuracy on mountainous areas.
   An improved method for monitoring the Snow Depth (SD) on Alpine areas is presented here. Equivalent Brightness Temperature Tb-eq at an enhanced spatial resolution, corrected for the effects of orography and forest coverage, were computed from the AMSR-E measurements by using ancillary information on land use, surface temperature, and a digital elevation model (DEM). These equivalent Tb-eq values were used instead of the original AMSR-E measurements as inputs of an algorithm that estimates SD on a global scale basing on and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques from AMSR-E brightness temperatures at X-, Ku- and Ka-bands, V-polarization. The improvement in the retrieval accuracy using these Tb-eq equivalent values was evaluated using data collected during the winters between 2002 and 2011 on a test area located in the eastern part of the Italian Alps.

AB Increasing the accuracy and spatial coverage of Leaf Area Index (LAI) values is an important part of any attempt to successfully model global atmosphere/biosphere interactions. It is further a fundamental parameter in land surface processes and Earth system climate models. Remote sensing methods offer an opportunity to improve on each of these requirements but are typically limited by the necessity for validation using labor intensive and sparsely collected in situ measurements.
   In this paper we present the results of an intercomparative study of ground-based, airborne and spaceborne retrievals of total LAI over the conifer-dominated forests of Sierra Nevada in California. The efficacy of LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor) airborne waveform lidar LAI measurements (total and vertical profile) has previously been validated at the site specific level using destructive sampling. We also explore the efficacy of ground based measurements obtained from hemispherical photography, LAI-2000, and ground based lidar, acknowledging discrepancies existing between the systems and collected data. We highlight their use and role in validating the relationship between ground and airborne estimates of total LAI (LVIS LAI correlation with i) hemispherical photographs, r(2) = 0.80, ii) IAI-2000, r(2) = 0.85, and iii) terrestrial lidar, r(2) = 0.76. The existence of such relationships offers immediate implications for LAI estimation where LVIS data is available, creating the potential to obtain, not only total LAI values but also corresponding vertical LAI distributions from a ground validated source previously unobtainable at this spatial scale.
   The ability to validate airborne lidar LAI data collected at different spatial scales to the available ground measurements allows further upscaled validation using global lidar datasets provided by spacebome lidar, such as the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). In the absence of adequate ground validation plots coincident with GLAS footprints, GLAS LAI validation is examined using geographically limited but spatially continuous LVIS data. Under favorable conditions, significantly the absence of slopes greater than similar to 20 degrees, the comparison between LVIS and GLAS IAI values obtained using a recursive algorithm constrained by independently validated LAI limits exposes the capability of GLAS as an accurate standalone LAI sensor (r(2) = 0.69, bias = -0.05 and RMSE = 0.33). The correlation comparison between LVIS and GLAS LAI estimates not only significantly exceed those associated with equivalent space borne passive remote sensing datasets, such as MODIS (r(2) = 0.20, bias = -0.16 and RMSE = 0.67) but also offers significant advantages to future research including the prospective validation of regional and global L.Al products and data comparison with ecosystem model inputs. The encountered effectiveness of these relationships allows the implementation of a scaling-up strategy where ground-based LAI observations are related to aircraft observations of LAI, which in turn are used to validate GLAS LAI derived from coincident data. Successful implementation of this strategy paves the way for the future recovery of vertical LAI profiles on a global scale and opens up the potential for fusion studies to incorporate widely available and spatially abundant passive optical datasets.

AB We exhibit a technique to detect and estimate precipitation over the global oceans using the radar back scattering coefficient and brightness temperature measurements from Oceansat-II scatterometer along with numerical weather prediction model derived rain sensitive parameters via a neural network (NN) based setup. Rain/no-rain labels are generated by analyzing rainfall observations from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observation Satellite (EOS) (AMSR-E) which are concurrent (within a spatiotemporal bin 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees latitude-longitude and 900 s) to Oceansat-II overpasses. The rain sensitivity of all the parameters is examined. NN is applied in two stages: (1) rain identification and (2) rain quantification with training samples from five different overlapping geographical regions [I(25 degrees N-25 degrees S), II(15 degrees N-45 degrees N), III(35 degrees N-70 degrees N), IV(15 degrees S-45 degrees S) and V(35 degrees S-70 degrees S)]. Rain identification accuracy is about 93%, 87%, 90%, 79%, and 85%, and no-rain detection accuracy of about 97%, 87%, 86%, 84% and 86% for these regions. The missing rain cases are few compared to the size of norain samples and are largely from the low rain regime. The RMS error of instantaneous rain estimation for regions I to V (rain rates varying from >0 to approximately 45, 25, 25, 45, and 20 mm h(-1)) is found to be 1.86, 0.69, 0.47, 0.56, and 0.46 mm h(-1), respectively. The qualitative comparisons of instantaneous, 3-days, monthly and seasonal rain rates from scatterometer and AMSR-E demonstrate a-good agreement between them. Probability distribution of monthly rain rates from scatterometer and AMSR-E is also compared, indicating the consistency of scatterometer derived rain with AMSR-E rain in a climatic scale.

AB Soil moisture is crucial in regulating vegetation productivity and controlling terrestrial carbon uptake. This study aims to quantify the impact of soil moisture on vegetation at large spatial and long-term temporal scales using independent satellite observations. We used a newly developed satellite-derived soil moisture product and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the impact of soil moisture on vegetation across mainland Australia between 1991 and 2009. Our approach relied on multiple statistical methods including: (i) windowed cross correlation; (ii) quantile regression: (iii) piecewise linear regression. We found a strong positive relationship between soil moisture and NDVI, with NDVI typically lagging behind soil moisture by one month. The temporal characteristics of this relation show substantial regional variability. Dry regions with low vegetation density are more sensitive to soil moisture for the high end of the distribution of NDVI than moist regions, suggesting that soil moisture enhances vegetation growth in dry regions and in the early stage in wet regions. Using piecewise linear regression, we detected three periods with different soil moisture trends over the 19 years. The changes in NDVI trends are significant (p < 0.01) with turning points of soil moisture in the beginning of 2000 and the end of 2002.

AB Detailed information on the spatial and temporal distribution of land cover is required to evaluate the effects of land cover change on environmental processes. The development of temporally consistent land cover time series (LCTS) from satellite-based earth observation has proven difficult because multi-year observations are acquired under different conditions resulting in high inter-annual reflectance variability. This leads to spurious differences in land cover when standard approaches for image classification are applied to generate multi-year land cover data. To reduce this effect, a common solution has been to first detect change and update a base map for only these change areas. As long as the change commission error is low, this approach will ensure high consistency between maps in the time series. Here we present an approach for change-based LCTS development following from previous research, but with significant advancements in change detection, training, classification, and evidence-based refinement. The method was applied to generate an annual LCTS covering Canada spanning 2000-2011 that is consistent between years and can be used to identify dominant change transitions. Assessment of the LCTS was challenging because multiple maps needed to be evaluated and can be prohibitive particularly for annual time series covering several years. Three approaches were undertaken involving visual examination, comparison with a reference sample derived from Landsat, and comparison with the MODIS Global LCTS V5.1. Visual assessment revealed high inter-map consistency and logical temporal change trajectories of land cover classes. Comparison with the reference sample showed an accuracy of 70% at the 19 class thematic resolution. Accounting for mixed pixels by considering the first or second reference land cover label as correct increased the accuracy to 80%. Comparison with the MODIS Global LCTS showed that the Canada LCTS achieved higher inter-map consistency and accuracy as expected with national relative to global land cover products.

AB According to the radiance-based (R-based) validation of the collection-5 or version-5 (C5 or V5) Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land-surface temperature (LST) level-2 products at 42 sites in a wide LST range in different seasons and years, the LST errors are within +/-2 K (within +/-1K in most cases) for all the sites but six bare soil sites. The V5 LSTs are underestimated by more than 2 K and up to 4.5 K at the desert site near In-salah, Algeria. Three refinements were implemented in the V6.3.0 daily LST Product Generation Executive (PGE)16 code: 1) refine the original viewing angle dependent split-window algorithm by adding two sets of coefficients separately for retrieval of daytime and nighttime LSTs at bare soil pixels in the hot and warm bare soil zone (HAWBSZ) within latitude range from -38 degrees to 49.5 degrees, 2) adjust the emissivity difference in bands 31 and 32 for bare soil pixels in HAWBSZ, and 3) incorporate the new refined split-window algorithm into the day/night algorithm for retrieving surface emissivity and temperature values at 6 km grids in HAWBSZ. The V63.0 PGE16 code was tested with C6 Aqua and Terra MODIS input data over a period of one year or longer in selected tile regions. The resulting C6 level-2 LST products were evaluated at five bare soil sites in north Africa, where radiosonde observation data for atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles are available, with 12 R-based validation data sets as follows: the mean LST error is within +/-0.6 K in 10 validate data sets, 0.8 K in one data set (for daytime LSTs at SVU site) and 1.9 K in another set (for daytime LSTs at Farafra site). The standard deviation of the C6 LST validation errors is less than 0.5 K in all the 12 validation data sets but the data set for daytime LSTs at Farafra site at 0.7 K. Statistical and viewing angle dependence analyses of the retrieved surface emissivity values also indicate that the C6 level-3 LST products are much better than the previous C4.1 and C5 products.

AB In this study, the accuracy of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) combined Terra (MOD) and Aqua (MYD) 16-day albedo product (MCD43) is evaluated through comparisons with eleven years of in situ measurements at 17 automatic weather stations on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Taking into consideration accuracy issues with in situ observations, results show that utilizing all high-quality, cloud-free MODIS retrievals gives physically realistic ice sheet albedo values for solar zenith angles less than 75, with a root-mean-square error of 0.067 (RMSE) and an overall mean bias of +0.022 (with the MODIS data biased slightly high relative to the in situ data). Using this data set, changes in ice sheet albedo from 2000 to 2012 are documented. Analysis reveals negative trends in ice sheet albedo during summer over the 13-year data record, with persistent negative albedo anomalies in recent years over western Greenland. During summer 2012, extensive surface melt resulted in a Greenland area-averaged albedo anomaly for June, July August relative to 2000-2009 of -0.044 that significantly increased the amount of total absorbed solar radiation and surface melt.

AB Northern hemisphere peatlands play an important role in the global carbon (C) cycle, accounting for about 30% of global soil C and similar to 10-25% of global natural methane (CH4) emissions. Satellite remote sensing has the potential for extracting continuous information related to C exchange rates at regional and global extents, yet, few studies have focused on peatlands. In this study we examined the potential of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI and simple ratio, SR), MODIS light use efficiency (LUE) based gross primary production (GPP) and a MODIS derived phenological index (annual peak photosynthetic rate) for the estimation of eddy covariance (EC) flux-derived GPP and net ecosystem production (NEP) at four contrasting northern peatlands. At the four sites of this study MODIS NDVI and SR explained between 39% and 71%, and between 42% and 69% of the variation in EC-derived GPP, respectively; and between 25% and 53%, and between 29% and 39% of the variation in EC-derived NEP, respectively. The relationships were mostly consistent across sites and within sites, suggesting that data may be pooled across years and sites, which could simplify the prediction of gross and net C dioxide (CO2) uptake over large areas dominated by northern peatlands based on MODIS data. MODIS GPP explained between 68% and 89% of the variation in EC-derived GPP at the four study sites. The root mean square errors ranged between 0.62 and 1.16 g C m(-2) d(-1) and were similar to errors from ecosystem process model estimates reported in the literature. Annual peak MODIS GPP, NDVI and SR rates explained up to 50% of the variations in annual cumulative EC-derived GPP and NEP at two of the study sites. Our results show the potentials and limitations of MODIS data to monitor the C dynamics of northern peatlands; among the three studied approaches the MODIS LUE-based GPP approach showed better performance as a predictor of GPP and NEP. The other approaches (VIs and phenology) can provide important input data for LUE models. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Global climate change and sustained urban growth have increased the necessity of assessing the role that urban vegetation plays in urban dwellers' lives, as well as in urban ecosystem services. Urban environmental studies, however, still lack methods to characterize urban vegetation with adequate detail and across large areas. To remedy this gap, we apply a Support-Vector-Machine approach to classify eight frequent tree genera in the capital city of Berlin, Germany. We investigate different spectral and temporal band combinations of five RapidEye images acquired during the 2009 phenological season, and use ancillary surface and terrain models for orthorectification and improved tree masking. Results show that intra-annual time-series of RapidEye data can be used for high-precision tree genera classification in an urban environment. Differences within RapidEye time-series correlate well with empirical phenological studies of different tree genera, and RapidEye's red-edge band supports class separability. Further assessment is needed on the individual tree level and mixed stands regarding the quality of mapping urban individual trees, as our sampling approach mainly focused on larger stands with only a single tree genus. Urban applications will benefit from multitemporal RapidEye data, which offers area-wide monitoring and allows in-depth vegetation analysis to augment existing assessments. Such information is indispensable for assessing differences in urban ecosystem services related to carbon storage, cooling or air filtering, all of which differ between tree species. Therefore, the importance of in-depth analyses of urban vegetation cannot be underestimated in today's context of climate change. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding canopy radiation regimes is critical to successfully modeling vegetation growth and function. For instance, the vertical distribution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) affects vegetation growth, informative upon carbon and energy cycling. Availing upon advances in information capture and computing power, geometrically explicit modeling of forest structure becomes increasingly possible: A primary challenge however is acquiring the forest mensuration data required to parameterize these models and the related automation of modeling forest structure. In this research, to address these issues we employ a novel and automated approach that capitalizes upon the rich information afforded by ground-based laser scanning technology. The method is implemented in two steps: in the first step, geometric explicit models of canopy structure are created from the ground-based laser scanning data. These geometric explicit models are used to simulate the vertical range to first hit. In the second step, we derive canopy gap probability from full waveform laser scanning data which have been used in a number of studies for characterization of radiation transmission Uupp et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010) and do not require any geometric explicit modeling. The radiative consistency of the geometric explicit models from step 1 is validated against the gap probabilities of step 2. The results show a strong relationship between the radiative transmission properties of the geometric models and canopy gap probabilities at plot level (R = 0.91 to 0.97), while the geometric models suggest the additional benefit to serve as a bridge in scaling between shoot level and canopy level radiation.

AB Using the "photochemical reflectance index" (PRI) as a measure of xanthophyll pigment activity and photosynthetic light-use efficiency, we examined physiological responses to diurnal illumination in mature forest stands. In a Douglas-fir forest in Corvallis, Oregon, PRI varied primarily with illumination, which was strongly influenced by canopy aspect and time of day. Once normalized for illumination, PRI exhibited a pattern of midday depression similar to that of leaf photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. Comparable optical responses to illumination were detected at canopy and leaf scales, demonstrating that remote spectroradiometry could be applied to monitor photosynthetic downregulation in uniform, closed stands. In similar measurements at a ponderosa pine forest in Black Butte, Oregon, an old tree exhibited more suppressed midday PRI values than a young tree, once values were normalized for illumination. Unlike the PRI response in Douglas-fir, variation in the diurnal PRI response between individual ponderosa pine trees was a predominant source of PRI variation. This contrasting age effect was consistent with other studies at this site showing reduced midday photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in old trees due to hydraulic limitations. These results indicate that diurnal and spatial patterns of photosynthetic activity in structurally complex evergreen forest stands can be characterized with narrow-band spectral reflectance, provided measurements are properly normalized by illumination. These findings also support recent studies using field and satellite remote sensing that report strong effects of illumination on the PRI signal from forest stands, and provide additional evidence that individual canopy responses can reveal contrasting degrees of photosynthetic downregulation due to varying stress effects within a single forest stand. Together, these results support the hypothesis that photosynthesis is coordinately regulated, allowing PRI to detect changing levels of stomatal activity and carboxylation. While illumination patterns and photosynthetic downregulation both influenced PRI, pigment pool sizes and enhanced PRI under prolonged low light provided additional sources of PRI variation in the canopy signal. Further understanding of these multiple PRI responses could help realize the goal of remote sensing of photosynthetic activity using PRI. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The food security of smallholder farmers is vulnerable to climate change and climate variability. Cropping intensity, the number of crops planted annually, can be used as a measure of food security for smallholder farmers given that it can greatly affect net production. Current techniques for quantifying cropping intensity may not accurately map smallholder farms where the size of one field is typically smaller than the spatial resolution of readily available satellite data. We evaluated four methods that use multi-scalar datasets and are commonly used in the literature to assess cropping intensity of smallholder farms: 1) the Landsat threshold method, which identifies if a Landsat pixel is cropped or uncropped during each growing season, 2) the MODIS peak method, which determines if there is a phenological peak in the MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index time series during each growing season, 3) the MODIS temporal mixture analysis, which quantifies the sub-pixel heterogeneity of cropping intensity using phenological MODIS data, and 4) the MODIS hierarchical training method, which quantifies the sub-pixel heterogeneity of cropping intensity using hierarchical training techniques. Each method was assessed using four criteria: 1) data availability, 2) accuracy across different spatial scales (at aggregate scales 250 x 250 m, 1 x 1 km, 5 x 5 km, and 10 x 10 km), 3) ease of implementation, and 4) ability to use the method over large spatial and temporal scales. We applied our methods to two regions in India (Gujarat and southeastern Madhya Pradesh) that represented diversity in crop type, soils, climatology, irrigation access, cropping intensity, and field size. We found that the Landsat threshold method is the most accurate (R-2 >= 0.71 and RMSE <= 0.14), particularly at smaller scales of analysis. Yet given the limited availability of Landsat data, we find that the MODIS hierarchical training method meets multiple criteria for mapping cropping intensity over large spatial and temporal scales. Furthermore, the adjusted R-2 between predicted and validation data generally increased and the RMSE decreased with spatial aggregation >= 5 x 5 km (R-2 up to 0.97 and RMSE as low as 0.00). Our model accuracy varied based on the region and season of analysis and was lowest during the summer season in Gujarat when there was high sub-pixel heterogeneity due to sparsely cropped agricultural land-cover. While our results specifically apply to our study regions in India, they most likely also apply to smallholder agriculture in other locations across the globe where the same types of satellite data are readily available.

AB Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) has been widely employed in analyzing urban environments, especially for estimating urban impervious surface distribution at the subpixel level. When implementing SMA, endmember selection is considered an important step, and an inappropriate endmember set could severely affect the accuracy of fractional land covers. Although different degrees of success have been achieved in existing SMA approaches, the paradox of endmember selection is still unsolved: theoretically "purest" endmembers that can be selected with relative ease do not always yield optimal results, while the selection of the most "representative" endmembers is very difficult with simple SMA. To address this problem, we propose a spatially adaptive SMA (SASMA) technique to automatically extract and synthesize the "most representative" endmembers for SMA through considering both between-class and within-class variations. In particular, we developed a classification tree method to automatically extract endmember candidates through incorporating spectral and spatial information. In addition, to mitigate the effect of within-class variation, we employed synthetic spectra of neighboring endmember candidates in a local search window as the most "representative" endmember signature. Results indicate that SASMA performs well in estimating subpixel impervious surface distribution with relatively high precision (mean absolute error of 8.50%, root mean square error of 15.25%, and R-2 of 0.701) and small bias (systematic error of -0.93%).

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F-s) is an electromagnetic signal emitted in the 650-800 nm spectral window by the chlorophyll-a of green leaves. Previous studies demonstrated the retrieval of F-s on a global scale using high spectral resolution measurements by the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) on board the greenhouse gases observing satellite (GOSAT). The retrieval of F-s from GOSAT-FTS data is based on the modeling of the in-filling of solar Fraunhofer lines by F-s. The first Fs retrieval methods for GOSAT-FTS measurements were based on physical formulations of the radiative transfer between the atmosphere, the surface and the instrument including the F-s emission. As an alternative, a statistical method was also successfully applied to GOSAT data. This method is based on a singular vector decomposition (SVD) technique producing a basis of spectral functions able to model the contribution of the reflected solar radiation to the top-of-atmosphere measurement in a linear way. The F-s signal is included in the forward model as an extra parameter adding to the reflected solar radiation. Here, we use field spectroscopy measurements to provide further experimental evidence on the retrieval of F-s with statistical approaches in both Fraunhofer lines and atmospheric oxygen and water vapor bands. The statistical retrieval method used with GOSAT-FTS data has been adapted to a set of ground-based spectro-radiometer measurements in the 717-780 nm range. Retrieval results in the 745-759 nm window, which contains only Fraunhofer lines, support the overall approach of estimating F-s from space measurements in that spectral window. Furthermore, the application of the method to broader fitting windows including both Fraunhofer lines and and (oxygen and water vapor) atmospheric bands atmospheric bands has been proven to be very effective to reduce the retrieval noise and has also shown a good comparison with reference O(2)A-based retrievals. This allows consideration of statistical methods as a powerful option for F-s retrieval from broad-band space-based measurements in the near-infrared. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In this work we demonstrate the utility of satellite remote sensing for river discharge nowcasting and forecasting for two major rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra, in southern Asia. Passive microwave sensing of the river and floodplain at more than twenty locations upstream of Hardinge Bridge (Ganges) and Bahadurabad (Brahmaputra) gauging stations are used to: 1) examine the capability of remotely sensed flow information to track the downstream propagation of river flow waves and 2) evaluate their use in producing river flow nowcasts, and forecasts at 1-15 days lead time. The pattern of correlation between upstream satellite data and in situ observations of downstream discharge is used to estimate wave propagation time. This pattern of correlation is combined with a cross-validation method to select the satellite sites that produce the most accurate river discharge estimates in a lagged regression model. The results show that the well-correlated satellite-derived flow (SDF) signals were able to detect the propagation of a river flow wave along both river channels. The daily river discharge (contemporaneous) nowcast produced from the upstream SDFs could be used to provide missing data estimates given its Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of 0.8 for both rivers; and forecasts have considerably better skill than autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) model beyond 3-day lead time for Brahmaputra. Due to the expected better accuracy of the SDF for detecting large flows, the forecast error is found to be lower for high flows compared to low flows. Overall, we conclude that satellite-based flow estimates are a useful source of dynamical surface water information in data-scarce regions and that they could be used for model calibration and data assimilation purposes in near-time hydrologic forecast applications.

MOD17A2 estimates GPP according to the light use efficiency (LUE) concept assuming a fixed maximum rate of carbon assimilation per unit photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by the vegetation (epsilon(max)). Minimum temperature and vapor pressure deficit derived from meteorological data down-regulate epsilon(max) and constrain carbon assimilation. This data is useful for regional to global studies of the terrestrial carbon budget, climate change and natural resources. In this study we evaluated the MOD17A2 product and its driver data by using in situ measurements of meteorology and eddy covariance GPP for 12 African sites. MOD17A2 agreed well with eddy covariance GPP for wet sites. Overall, seasonality was well captured but MOD17A2 GPP was underestimated for the dry sites located in the Sahel region. Replacing the meteorological driver data derived from coarse resolution reanalysis data with tower measurements reduced MOD17A2 GPP uncertainties, however, the underestimations at the dry sites persisted. Inferred epsilon(max) calculated from tower data was higher than the epsilon(max) prescribed in MOD17A2. This, in addition to uncertainties in fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) explains some of the underestimations. The results suggest that improved quality of driver data, but primarily a readjustment of the parameters in the biome parameter look-up table (BPLUT) may be needed to better estimate GPP for African ecosystems in MOD17A2.

AB The NASA IceBridge flights have obtained critical observations for Earth's polar ice since ICESat stopped collecting data in 2009. This study develops an automatic method in processing IceBridge Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) altimeter L1B data (one elevation per 3-4 m horizontally) to derive a local sea level height for referencing snow freeboards and then computing sea ice thicknesses. Four 30-km LIB profiles (A, B, C and D) flown on October 21, 2009 over the Bellingshausen Sea in Antarctica are selected. The local sea level reference is first obtained by visual examination of ATM L1B heights over leads or thin ice identified on images simultaneously acquired from the Digital Mapping System camera (called manual selection). This sea level reference is then used as ground truth to validate sea level heights derived by automatic calculations using five thresholds of 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.2% and 0.1% of the lowest LIB data. The L1B_02% method gives a similar sea level height as from the LIB manual selection, by mean (absolute) difference of -0.01 (0.06) m. The sea level heights demonstrate a near linear gradient of 0.01 m/km to 0.03 m/km within each similar to 30-km L1B profile along the flight track from section A to D. The resulting mean snow freeboards are 0.59 m, 0.67 m, 053 m, and 0.60 m on sections A, B, C and D, respectively. Three empirical equations and the buoyancy equation (with zero ice freeboard assumption) all give similar statistics in ice thickness estimation with mean ice thicknesses of 1.91 m for section A, 2.16 m for B, 1.76 m for C, and 1.94 m for D. The sea level over leads cannot be accurately resolved from the ATM L2 data (similar to 60 m x 80 m horizontal averaging). However, by using a sea level reference obtained from the LIB data, the ATM L2 data can achieve reasonable ice thickness estimates with mean absolute difference of only 0.10 m compared to thickness derived from the L1B data.

AB Fire activity in the Alaskan boreal forest though episodic at annual and intra-annual time scales, has experienced an increase over the last several decades. Increases in burned area and fire severity are not only releasing more carbon to the atmosphere, but likely shifting vegetation composition in the region towards greater deciduous dominance and a reduction in coniferous stands. While some recent studies have addressed qualitative differences between large and small fire years in the Alaskan boreal forest, the ecological effects of a greater proportion of burning occurring during large fire years and during late season fires have not yet been examined.
   Some characteristics of wildfires that can be detected remotely are related to fire severity and can provide new information on spatial and temporal patterns of burning. This analysis focused on boreal wildfire intensity (fire radiative power, or FRP) contained in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily active fire product from 2003 to 2010. We found that differences in FRP resulted from seasonality and intra-annual variability in fire activity levels, vegetation composition, latitudinal variation, and fire spread behavior.
   Our studies determined two general categories of active fire detections: new detections associated with the spread of the fire front and residual pixels in areas that had already experienced front burning. Residual pixels had a lower average FRP than front pixels, but represented a high percentage of all pixels during periods of high fire activity (large fire years, late season burning, and seasonal periods of high fire activity). As a result, the FRP from periods of high fire activity was less intense than those from periods of low fire activity. Differences related to latitude were greater than expected, with higher latitudes burning later in the season and at a higher intensity than lower latitudes. Differences in vegetation type indicate that coniferous vegetation is the most fire prone, but deciduous vegetation is not particularly fire resistant, as the proportion of active fire detections in deciduous stands is roughly the same as the fraction of deciduous vegetation in the region.
   Qualitative differences between periods of high and low fire activity are likely to reflect important differences in fire severity. Large fire years are likely to be more severe, characterized by more late season fires and a greater proportion of residual burning. Given the potential for severe fires to effect changes in vegetation cover, the shift toward a greater proportion of area burning during large fire years may influence vegetation patterns in the region over the medium to long term.

AB We applied a spectroscopic analysis to Airborne Visible/InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data collected from low and medium altitudes during and after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to delineate the distribution of oil-damaged canopies in the marshes of Barataria Bay, Louisiana. Spectral feature analysis compared the AVIRIS data to reference spectra of oiled marsh by using absorption features centered near 1.7 and 23 mu m, which arise from C-H bonds in oil. AVIRIS-derived maps of oiled shorelines from the individual dates of July 31, September 14, and October 4, 2010, were 89.3%, 89.8%, and 90.6% accurate, respectively. A composite map at 3.5 m grid spacing, accumulated from the three dates, was 93.4% accurate in detecting oiled shorelines. The composite map had 100% accuracy for detecting damaged plant canopy in oiled areas that extended more than 1.2 m into the marsh. Spatial resampling of the AVIRIS data to 30 m reduced the accuracy to 73.6% overall. However, detection accuracy remained high for oiled canopies that extended more than 4 m into the marsh (23 of 28 field reference points with oil were detected). Spectral resampling of the 3.5 m AVIRIS data to Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) spectral response greatly reduced the detection of oil spectral signatures. With spatial resampling of simulated Landsat ETM data to 30 m, oil signatures were not detected. Overall, similar to 40 km of coastline, marsh comprised mainly of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus, were found to be oiled in narrow zones at the shorelines. Zones of oiled canopies reached on average 11 m into the marsh, with a maximum reach of 21 m. The field and airborne data showed that, in many areas, weathered oil persisted in the marsh from the first field survey. July 10, to the latest airborne survey. October 4, 2010. The results demonstrate the applicability of high spatial resolution imaging spectrometer data to identifying contaminants in the environment for use in evaluating ecosystem disturbance and response.

AB Aerial observations of light pollution can fill an important gap between ground based surveys and nighttime satellite data. Terrestrially bound surveys are labor intensive and are generally limited to a small spatial extent, and while existing satellite data cover the whole world, they are limited to coarse resolution. This paper describes the production of a high resolution (1 m) mosaic image of the city of Berlin, Germany at night. The dataset is spatially analyzed to identify the major sources of light pollution in the city based on urban land use data. An area-independent 'brightness factor' is introduced that allows direct comparison of the light emission from differently sized land use classes. and the percentage area with values above average brightness is calculated for each class. Using this methodology, lighting associated with streets has been found to be the dominant source of zenith directed light pollution (31.6%), although other land use classes have much higher average brightness. These results are compared with other urban light pollution quantification studies. The minimum resolution required for an analysis of this type is found to be near 10 m. Future applications of high resolution datasets such as this one could include: studies of the efficacy of light pollution mitigation measures, improved light pollution simulations, economic and energy use, the relationship between artificial light and ecological parameters (e.g. circadian rhythm, fitness, mate selection, species distributions, migration barriers and seasonal behavior), or the management of nightscapes.

AB There is a paucity of detailed and timely forest inventory information available for Canada's large, remote northern boreal forests. The Canadian National Forest Inventory program has derived a limited set of attributes from a Landsat-based land cover product representing circa year 2000 conditions. Of the required inventory attributes, forest vertical structure (e.g., tree height) is critical for terrestrial biomass and carbon modeling and to date, is unavailable for these remote areas. In this study, we develop a large-area, fine-scale (25 m) mapping solution to estimate tree height (mean, dominant, and Lorey's height) across Canada's northern forests by integrating lidar data (representing 0.27% of the study area), and Landsat imagery (representing 100% of the study area), using a geometric-optical modeling technique. First, spectral mixture analysis (SMA) was used to extract image endmembers and generate fraction images. Second, lidar data were used to calibrate the inverted geometric-optical model by adjusting the model's three key fractional inputs: sunlit crown, sunlit background, and shade fraction, based upon the SMA derived images. The heterogeneity of the study area, spanning 2.16 million ha, made it challenging to directly and accurately decompose mixed Landsat image pixels into the canopy and background fractions used for the Li-Strahler geometric-optical model inversion. As a result we developed a novel method to use the lidar plot data to facilitate the calculation of these fractions in an accurate and automated manner. The average estimation errors for mean, dominant, and Lorey's height were 4.9 m, 4.1 m, and 4.7 m, respectively when compared to the lidar data, with the best result achieved using dominant tree height, where the average error was 3.5 m for over 80% of the forested area. Using this approach of optical remotely sensed data calibrated and validated with lidar height estimates, we generate and evaluate wall-to-wall estimates of tree height that can subsequently be used as inputs for biomass and carbon modeling.

AB A method for the monitoring of night-time gas flaring of off-shore oil/gas extraction platforms using measurements of the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) and the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is presented and discussed in detail. The positions of off-shore extraction sites are accurately estimated by using SAR data, while the flaring activity is estimated from night-time shortwave infrared (SWIR) radiance measured by ATSR The North Sea area has been selected as test case and related flaring activity from 1991 to 2010 has been analysed at single site and at North Sea area scales. Results indicate a decline in the overall flaring activity during the time period considered in this work, although single sites can show positive flaring trends. The ATSR derived flaring time series has been compared to the crude oil production data provided by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), showing very good agreement in terms of trend and seasonal behaviour. We present a simple inversion scheme aimed at the evaluation of the flame parameters (temperature and size) from night-time shortwave, middle and thermal infrared ATSR measurements, and results are discussed in detail. Finally, the possibility to estimate flaring efficiency from satellite measurements and from detailed technical information on flaring devices is envisaged. The proposed approach can be easily extended to other areas in which gas flaring from off-shore oil and gas extraction are an important economic and environmental factor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Considerable interest has been given to forming an international collaboration to develop a virtual moderate spatial resolution land observation constellation through aggregation of data sets from comparable national observatories such as the US Landsat, the Indian ResourceSat and related systems. This study explores the complementarity of India's ResourceSat-1 Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) with the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). The analysis focuses on the comparative radiometry, geometry, and spectral properties of the two sensors. Two applied assessments of these data are also explored to examine the strengths and limitations of these alternate sources of moderate resolution land imagery with specific application domains. There are significant technical differences in these imaging systems including spectral band response, pixel dimensions, swath width, and radiometric resolution which produce differences in observation data sets. None of these differences was found to strongly limit comparable analyses in agricultural and forestry applications. Overall, we found that the AWiFS and Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery are comparable and in some ways complementary, particularly with respect to temporal repeat frequency. We have found that there are limits to our understanding of the AWiFS performance, for example, multi-camera design and stability of radiometric calibration over time, that leave some uncertainty that has been better addressed for Landsat through the Image Assessment System and related cross-sensor calibration studies. Such work still needs to be undertaken for AWiFS and similar observatories that may play roles in the Global Earth Observation System of Systems Land Surface Imaging Constellation.

AB In central Argentina, the Chinese tree glossy privet (Ligustrum lucidum) is an aggressive invasive species replacing native forests, forming dense stands, and is thus a major conservation concern. Mapping the spread of biological invasions is a necessary first step toward understanding the factors determining invasion patterns. Urban areas may function as propagule sources for glossy privet because it has been used as a landscaping tree for over a century. The objectives of this paper were to 1) map the patterns of glossy privet expansion from 1983 to 2006 using a time series of Landsat TM/ETM + images, and 2) analyze the spatial pattern of glossy privet stands with regard to urban extent. Using six summer Landsat TM images (1983, 1987, 1992, 1997, 2001, and 2006) the expansion of glossy privet was analyzed using Support Vector Machines (SVM), a non-parametric classifier which we applied to a stack of all images simultaneously, a novel approach in its application to monitor non-native tree invasions. We then measured the area of glossy privet in a series of 200-m buffers at increasing distances around urban areas in 1983 and 2006, and compared it with the amount of privet expected in proportion to buffer area Glossy privet in the study area has spread very rapidly during the 23 years that we studied and the SVM resulted in highly accurate classifications (Kappa Index 0.88, commission error 0.07, omission error 0.16). Between 1983 and 2006 glossy privet area increased 50 times (from 50 to 2500 ha), and 20% of all forest in the study area is now dominated by glossy privet Most of the glossy privet dominated stands were located within 600 m of urban areas. However, the rate of glossy privet expansion accelerated substantially after 1992 and new glossy privet dominated stands tend to be located away from urban areas. This suggests that glossy privet is now self-sustaining, but expected urban growth in the area could further foster glossy privet invasion. Management and development plans should include mitigation efforts to contain this species and prevent invasion into native forests, and citizens should be informed about the risk of invasion associated with the use of glossy privet for landscaping.

AB A spectroradiometer able to measure up to 2500 nm has been used to measure the reflectance for the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) 1020 nm band. In July and October 2010 two measurement campaigns were organized at the Scheldt river to collect reflectance spectra and corresponding Total Suspended Matter (TSM) concentration and turbidity. A wide range of TSM concentration was covered from 15 to 402 mg L-1. The measurements show a significant increase in reflectance between 950 and 1150 nm, corresponding to a decrease in the pure water absorption coefficient. A high correlation was observed between the reflectance at 1020 and 1071 nm and ism concentration. The results were confirmed by simulations with Hydrolight and by the analysis of airborne Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) imagery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spaceborne remote sensing techniques and numerical simulations have been combined in a web-GIS framework (LAV@HAZARD) to evaluate lava flow hazard in real time. By using the HOTSAT satellite thermal monitoring system to estimate time-varying TADR (time averaged discharge rate) and the MAGFLOW physics-based model to simulate lava flow paths, the LAV@HAZARD platform allows timely definition of parameters and maps essential for hazard assessment, including the propagation time of lava flows and the maximum run-out distance. We used LAV@HAZARD during the 2008-2009 lava flow-forming eruption at Mt Etna (Sicily, Italy). We measured the temporal variation in thermal emission (up to four times per hour) during the entire duration of the eruption using SEVIRI and MODIS data. The time-series of radiative power allowed us to identify six diverse thermal phases each related to different dynamic volcanic processes and associated with different TADRs and lava flow emplacement conditions. Satellite-derived estimates of lava discharge rates were computed and integrated for the whole period of the eruption (almost 14 months), showing that a lava volume of between 32 and 61 million cubic meters was erupted of which about 2/3 was emplaced during the first 4 months. These time-varying discharge rates were then used to drive MAGFLOW simulations to chart the spread of lava as a function of time. TADRs were sufficiently low (<30 m(3)/s) that no lava flows were capable of flowing any great distance so that they did not pose a hazard to vulnerable (agricultural and urban) areas on the flanks of Etna.

AB Aboveground woody biomass for circa-2000 is mapped at national scale in Uganda at 30-m spatial resolution on the basis of Landsat ETM + images, a National land cover dataset and field data using an object-oriented approach. A regression tree-based model (Random Forest) produces good results (cross-validated R-2 0.81, RMSE 13 T/ha) when trained with a sufficient number of field plots representative of the vegetation variability at national scale. The Random Forest model captures non-linear relationships between satellite data and biomass density, and is able to use categorical data (land cover) in the regression to improve the results. Biomass estimates were strongly correlated (r = 0.90 and r = 0.83) with independent LiDAR measurements. In this study, we demonstrate that in certain contexts Landsat data provide the capability to spatialize field biomass measurements and produce accurate and detailed estimates of biomass distribution at national scale. We also investigate limitations of this approach, which tend to provide conservative biomass estimates. Specific limitations are mainly related to saturation of the optical signal at high biomass density and cloud cover, which hinders the compilation of a radiometrically consistent multi-temporal dataset As a result, a Landsat mosaic created for Uganda with images acquired in the dry season during 1999-2003 does not contain phenological information useful for discriminating some vegetation types, such as deciduous formations. The addition of land cover data increases the model performance because it provides information on vegetation phenology. We note that Landsat data present higher spatial and thematic resolution compared to land cover and allow detailed and spatially continuous biomass estimates to be mapped. Fusion of satellite and ancillary data may improve biomass predictions but, to avoid error propagation, accurate, detailed and up-to-date land cover or other ancillary data are necessary.

AB The difference between the top of atmosphere shortwave clear sky (cloud and aerosol free, SWCLR) and aerosol sky radiative fluxes is known as direct radiative effect (DRE) for all aerosols or Direct Climate Forcing (DCF) for anthropogenic aerosols. There are several methods for calculating SWCLR including satellite-based methods and radiative transfer approaches. Since uncertainties in SWCLR can propagate into errors in DRE or DCF, we assess the SWCLR estimates over the global oceans using three approaches and quantify the differences among these methods both as a function of space and season. Our results indicate that the more commonly used intercept (73.4 +/- 3.6) and radiative transfer methods (74.7 +/- 4.0 Wm(-2)) are in close agreement to within +/- 1.3 Wm(-2). Values of SWCLR are provided as a function of space and season that can be used by other studies that require such values or as a source of validation. We further recommend that research studies report the methods and assumptions used to estimate SWCLR to facilitate easier intercomparisons among methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of the seasonal cycle of boreal forest understory has been noticed in global remote sensing of vegetation, especially in remote sensing of biophysical properties (e.g. leaf area index) of the tree-layer in a forest. A general problem in the validation of operationally produced global biophysical vegetation products is the lack of ground reference data on the seasonal variability of different land surface types. Currently, little is known about the spectral properties of the understory layers of boreal forests, and even less is known about the seasonal dynamics of the spectra. In this paper, we report seasonal trajectories of understory reflectance spectra measured in a European boreal forest. Four study sites representing different forest fertility site types were selected from central Finland. The understory composition was recorded and its spectra measured with an ASD FieldSpec Hand-Held UV/VNIR Spectroradiometer ten times during the growing period (from May to September) in 2010. Our results show that the spectral differences between and within understory types are the largest at the peak of the growing season in early July whereas in the beginning and end of the growing season (i.e. early May and late September, respectively) the differences between the understory types are marginal. In general, the fertile sites had the brightest NIR spectra throughout the growing season whereas infertile types appeared darker in NIR. Our results also indicated that a mismatch in the seasonal development of understory and tree layers does not occur in boreal forests: the understory and tree layer vegetation develop at a similar pace in the spring (i.e. there are no or only few spring ephemerals present), and the forests with the strongest seasonal dynamics in tree canopy structure (LAI) have also the strongest dynamics in understory spectra.

   canopy height estimates from spaceborne lidar

AB A spaceborne lidar mission could serve multiple scientific purposes including remote sensing of ecosystem structure, carbon storage, terrestrial topography and ice sheet monitoring. The measurement requirements of these different goals will require compromises in sensor design. Footprint diameters that would be larger than optimal for vegetation studies have been proposed. Some spaceborne lidar mission designs include the possibility that a lidar sensor would share a platform with another sensor, which might require off-nadir pointing at angles of up to 16 degrees. To resolve multiple mission goals and sensor requirements, detailed knowledge of the sensitivity of sensor performance to these aspects of mission design is required.
   This research used a radiative transfer model to investigate the sensitivity of forest height estimates to footprint diameter, off-nadir pointing and their interaction over a range of forest canopy properties. An individual-based forest model was used to simulate stands of mixed conifer forest in the Tahoe National Forest (Northern California, USA) and stands of deciduous forests in the Bartlett Experimental Forest (New Hampshire, USA). Waveforms were simulated for stands generated by a forest succession model using footprint diameters of 20 m to 70 m. Off-nadir angles of 0 to 16 degrees were considered for a 25 m diameter footprint diameter.
   Footprint diameters in the range of 25 m to 30 m were optimal for estimates of maximum forest height (R-2 of 0.95 and RMSE of 3 m). As expected, the contribution of vegetation height to the vertical extent of the waveform decreased with larger footprints, while the contribution of terrain slope increased. Precision of estimates decreased with an increasing off-nadir pointing angle, but off-nadir pointing had less impact on height estimates in deciduous forests than in coniferous forests. When pointing off-nadir, the decrease in precision was dependent on local incidence angle (the angle between the off-nadir beam and a line normal to the terrain surface)which is dependent on the off-nadir pointing angle, terrain slope, and the difference between the laser pointing azimuth and terrain aspect; the effect was larger when the sensor was aligned with the terrain azimuth but when aspect and azimuth are opposed, there was virtually no effect on R-2 or RMSE. A second effect of off-nadir pointing is that the laser beam will intersect individual crowns and the canopy as a whole from a different angle which had a distinct effect on the precision of lidar estimates of height, decreasing R-2 and increasing RMSE, although the effect was most pronounced for coniferous crowns.

PROSPECT-5, to develop statistical relationships between leaf optical and chemical properties, which were applied to experimental data without any readjustment. Four distinct synthetic datasets were tested: two unrealistic, uniform distributions and two normal distributions based on statistical properties drawn from a comprehensive experimental database. Two methods used in remote sensing to retrieve vegetation chemical composition, spectral indices and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, were trained both on the synthetic and experimental datasets, and validated against observations. Results are compared to a cross-validation process and model inversion applied to the same observations. They show that synthetic datasets based on normal distributions of actual leaf chemical and structural properties can be used to optimize remotely sensed spectral indices or other retrieval methods for analysis of leaf chemical constituents. This study concludes with the definition of several polynomial relationships to retrieve leaf chlorophyll content. carotenoid content, equivalent water thickness and leaf mass per area using spectral indices, derived from synthetic data and validated on a large variety of leaf types. The straightforward method described here brings the possibility to apply or adapt statistical relationships to any type of leaf. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spectroscopy is the basis to detect and characterize offshore hydrocarbon (HC) seeps through optical remote sensing. Diagnostic spectral features of HCs are linked to their chemical composition and fundamental molecular vibrations (SWIR-TIR features), as well as overtones and combinations of these vibrations (VNIR-SWIR). These features allow for the characterization of oil, oil on water and emulsified oil. This work shows the results of lab and field spectral measurements of 17 petroleum samples yielded from key, oil-rich sedimentary basins in Brazil. Measurements comprised reflectance data (VNIR- SWIR), Attenuated Total Reflectance (AIR), Directional Hemispherical Reflectance (DHR), and emissivity data (TIR). These spectra were analyzed by multivariate techniques, such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least-Square analysis (PLS). The experimental results indicate that for the VNIR-SWIR range: (i) spectral features can be recognized for crude oil, emulsified oil and oil on ocean water; (ii) different oil types can be qualitatively distinguished based on these features (i.e. light or heavy), even considering oil on water; (iii) the same applies for oil measurements simulated at the spectral resolution of hyperspectral (357-bands/ProSpecTIR) and multispectral (9-bands/ASTER) sensors. Within TIR wavelengths (3-14 mu m), typical HC spectral features can also be resolved and oil types qualitatively discriminated using PCA/PLS, including both full-resolution spectra and spectra resampled to hyperspectral sensor (128-bands/SEBASS). However, despite the fact that oil emissivity is always lower than that of water, such separation seems unfeasible using 8-12 mu m TIR features only; emissivity spectra are essentially flat for all samples in this interval. This research demonstrated that oil can be qualitatively distinguished based on both VNIR-SWIR and TIR spectroscopy data, with important implications for remote off-shore oil exploration and classification of oil leakages.

AB A fuzzy set overlay model is used to analyze the distribution of moulins (vertical meltwater conduits) on Sermeq Avannarleq ("Dead Glacier") in West Greenland in 1985 and 2008-09. Input data is derived from a historical topographic map based on airborne visible imagery and more recent WorldView-1 panchromatic imagery, as well as an Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) digital elevation model (DEM). A non-parametric best-fit model approach using a Monte Carlo simulation is used to derive the membership functions for moulin location based on three independent variables - elevation, slope and aspect - and to test for the robustness of the model. We determine that there is a topographic setting independent of time that favors the development of moulins in this region. Using the membership functions, and an optimal alpha cut derived for 1985, we could correctly predict the locations of -88% of the moulins in 2008-09. The model accounts for increased surface melt in 2008-09 in comparison to 1985. Our results demonstrate the potential of a fuzzy set based approach to improve models of ice sheet hydrology in Western Greenland, by providing more reliable spatial distributions of entry points of meltwater into the ice based on remotely sensed datasets of the ice surface, which are readily available.

AB Satellite measurements from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua platform are used to study the ocean sand ridges in the eastern Bohai Sea in China. Even though the imaging mechanisms for SAR and MODIS-Aqua remote sensing are different, the sand ridges are shown to have exactly the same patterns in images from both sensors. Therefore, the location, extension and coverage of the ocean sand ridges can be detected and cross-examined by both SAR and MODIS-Aqua observations. Satellite images show quite different sand ridge distribution pattern from the published bathymetry map (based on in situ data) that shows six sand ridges in the area. 10 finger-shaped sand ridges are identified from satellite observations. The tidal-current/sand-ridge interaction driven physical and optical changes are assessed and evaluated. The existence of sand ridges causes enhanced water diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d(490) and elevated normalized water-leaving radiance at the red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. The sea surface over the sand ridges experiences significant seasonal variability of water turbidity and shows remarkable differences from nearby ocean regions. During winter, K-d(490) values are about 2-3 m(-1) over the ridges, while the maximum K-d(490) in the neighboring oceans is approximately 1.5 m(-1). In summer, the enhancement of the sea surface turbidity is less significant than that which occurs in winter. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The optical properties of natural waters beyond the visible range, in the near-infrared (NIR, 700-900 nm), have received little attention because they are often assumed to be mostly determined by the large absorption coefficient of pure water, and because of methodological difficulties. It is now growingly admitted that the NIR represents a potential optical source of unambiguous information about suspended sediments in turbid waters, thence the need for better understanding the NIR optical behaviour of such waters. It has recently been proposed (Ruddick et al., Limnology and Oceanography. 51, 1167-1179, 2006) that the variability in the shape of the surface ocean reflectance spectrum in the NIR is negligible in turbid waters. In the present study, we show, based on both in situ and remote sensing data, that the shape of the ocean reflectance spectrum in the NIR does vary in turbid to extremely turbid waters. Space-borne ocean reflectance data were collected using 3 different sensors (SeaWiFS, MODIS/Aqua and MERIS) over the Amazon, Mackenzie and Rio de la Plata turbid river plumes during extremely clear atmospheric conditions so that reliable removal of gas and aerosol effects on reflectance could be achieved. In situ NIR reflectance data were collected in different European estuaries where extremely turbid waters were found. In both data sets, a flattening of the NIR reflectance spectrum with increasing turbidity was observed. The ratio of reflectances at 765 nm and 865 nm, for instance, varied from ca. 2 down to 1 in our in situ data set, while a constant value of 1.61 had been proposed based on theory in a previous study. Radiative transfer calculations were performed using a range of realistic values for the seawater inherent optical properties, to determine the possible causes of variations in the shape of the NIR reflectance spectrum. Based on these simulations, we found that the most significant one was the gradual increase in the contribution of suspended sediments to the color of surface waters, which often leads to the flattening of the reflectance spectrum. Changes in the scattering and absorption properties of particles also contributed to variations in the shape of the NIR surface ocean reflectance spectrum. The impact of such variations on the interpretation of ocean color data is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a model for the estimation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from geostationary satellite data. The model is aimed to estimate the monthly average hourly PAR in a tropical environment. This model represents a physical relation of PAR incident on the earth's surface and satellite-derived earth-atmospheric albedo together with the absorption and scattering coefficients of various atmospheric constituents. The earth-atmospheric albedo was obtained from the Multifunctional Transport Satellite-1R (MTSAT-1R). The absorption of PAR by water vapor, an important process for the tropics, was computed from the ambient temperature and relative humidity. The absorption of PAR by aerosols was estimated by using the visibility data and aerosol optical properties obtained from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) of NASA in this region. The total column ozone from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument onboard of AURA satellite (OMI/AURA) was used for the estimation of the absorption of PAR by ozone. The model was validated against the monthly average hourly PAR from measurements at four solar radiation measuring stations situated in the tropical environment of Thailand. The values of the monthly average hourly PAR estimated from the model and those obtained from the measurement were in good agreement, with the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) of 9.8% and 0.6%, respectively. After the validation, the model was employed to estimate the monthly average hourly PAR over Thailand using a 4-year period of data from MTSAT-1R and other ancillary surface data. Values of the monthly average hourly PAR were presented as maps showing the geographical distribution of PAR. These maps reveal the diurnal and seasonal variation of PAR over the country.

AB The accurate quantification of gross primary production (GPP) in crops is important for regional and global studies of carbon budgets. Because of the observed close relationship between GPP and total canopy chlorophyll content in crops, vegetation indices related to chlorophyll can be used as a proxy of GPP. In this study, we justified the approach, tested the performance of several widely used chlorophyll-related vegetation indices in estimating total chlorophyll content and GPP in maize based on spectral data collected at a close range, 6 meters above the top of the canopy, over a period of eight years (2001 to 2008). The results show that GPP can be accurately estimated with chlorophyll-related indices that use near infra-red and either green or the red edge range of the spectrum. These indices provide the best approximation of the widely variable GPP in maize under both irrigated and rainfed conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The productivity of semi-arid rangelands on the Arabian Peninsula is spatially and temporally highly variable, and increasing grazing pressure as well as the likely effects of climatic change further threatens vegetation resources. Using the Al Jabal al Akhdar mountains in northern Oman as an example, our objectives were to analyse the availability and spatial distribution of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and the extent and causes of vegetation changes during the last decades with a remote sensing approach. A combination of destructive and non-destructive biomass measurements by life-form specific allometric equations was used to identify the ANPP of the ground vegetation (<50 cm) and the leaf and twig biomass of phanerophytes. The ANPP differed significantly among the life forms and the different plant communities, and the biomass of the sparsely vegetated ground was more than 50 times lower (mean = 0.22 t DM ha(-1)) than the biomass of phanerophytes (mean = 12.3 t DM ha(-1)). Among the different vegetation indices calculated NDVI proved to be the best predictor for rangeland biomass.
   Temporal trend analysis of Landsat satellite images from 1986 to 2009 was conducted using a pixel-based least square regression with the annual maximum Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVImax) as a dependent variable. Additionally, linear relationships of NDVImax and annual rainfall along the time series were calculated. The extent of human-induced changes was analysed using the residual trends method. A strongly significant negative biomass trend detected for 83% of the study area reflected a decrease in annual rainfall but even without clear evidence of deforestation of trees and shrubs, human-induced vegetation degradation due to settlement activities were also important.

AB The Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) measurements from the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites enable global monitoring of the distribution of clouds during day and night, with a spatial, temporal and spectral resolution that allows for better understanding of the role of clouds in global radiation budget and in climate in general. A method to retrieve cloud properties from nighttime SEVIRI measurements is described in this paper. The method is applicable to single-layer water clouds over sea surfaces and it is based on the inversion of a forward theoretical radiative transfer model, that simulates the radiances reaching the SEVIRI infrared detectors from a specified configuration of the earth-cloud-atmosphere system. This model accounts for scattering and absorption processes in the assumed horizontally homogeneous adiabatic cloud layer. For the inversion of this model, artificial neural networks techniques have been used in this work. The main advantage that these techniques provide is their low computational cost, which makes them suitable for the implementation of operational retrieval procedures. Results obtained by the proposed method are compared with the values provided by the CloudSat derived 2B-TAU product, and those derived from NOM-AVHRR nighttime imagery, obtaining good agreements.

AB Boreal forests are a critical component of the global carbon cycle, and timely monitoring allows for assessing forest cover change and its impacts on carbon dynamics. Earth observation data sets are an important source of information that allow for systematic monitoring of the entire biome. Landsat imagery, provided free of charge by the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) enable consistent and timely forest cover updates. However, irregular image acquisition within parts of the boreal biome coupled with an absence of atmospherically corrected data hamper regional-scale monitoring efforts using Landsat imagery. A method of boreal forest cover and change mapping using Landsat imagery has been developed and tested within European Russia between circa year 2000 and 2005. The approach employs a multi-year compositing methodology adapted for incomplete annual data availability, within-region variation in growing season length and frequent cloud cover. Relative radiometric normalization and cloud/shadow data screening algorithms were employed to create seamless image composites with remaining cloud/shadow contamination of less than 0.5% of the total composite area. Supervised classification tree algorithms were applied to the time-sequential image composites to characterize forest cover and gross forest loss over the study period. Forest cover results when compared to independently-derived samples of Landsat data have high agreement (overall accuracy of 89%, Kappa of 0.78), and conform with official forest cover statistics of the Russian government. Gross forest cover loss regional-scale mapping results are comparable with individual Landsat image pair change detection (overall accuracy of 98%, Kappa of 0.71). The gross forest cover loss within European Russia 2000-2005 is estimated to be 2210 thousand hectares, and constitutes a 1.5% reduction of year 2000 forest cover. At the regional scale, the highest proportional forest cover loss is estimated for the most populated regions (Leningradskaya and Moskovskaya Oblast). Our results highlight the forest cover depletion around large industrial cities as the hotspot of forest cover change in European Russia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB While existing remote sensing-based drought indices have characterized drought conditions in arid regions successfully, their use in humid regions is limited. We propose a new remote sensing-based drought index, the Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI), for agricultural drought monitoring in both arid and humid regions using multi-sensor data. This index combines the land surface temperature (LST) data and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, and precipitation data from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. Each variable was scaled from 0 to 1 to discriminate the effect of drought from normal conditions, and then combined with the selected weights. When tested against in-situ Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Palmer's Z-Index (Z-Index), 3-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and 6-month SPI data during a ten-year (2000-2009) period, SDCI performed better than existing indices such as NDVI and Vegetation Health Index (VHI) in the arid region of Arizona and New Mexico as well as in the humid region of North Carolina and South Carolina. The year-to-year changes and spatial distributions of SDCI over both arid and humid regions generally agreed to the changes documented by the United States Drought Monitor (USDM) maps.

AB Land use and land cover (LULC) maps from remote sensing are vital for monitoring, understanding and predicting the effects of complex human-nature interactions that span local, regional and global scales. We present a method to map annual LULC at a regional spatial scale with source data and processing techniques that permit scaling to broader spatial and temporal scales, while maintaining a consistent classification scheme and accuracy. Using the Dry Chaco ecoregion in Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay as a test site, we derived a suite of predictor variables from 2001 to 2007 from the MODIS 250 m vegetation index product (MOD13Q1). These variables included: annual statistics of red, near infrared, and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), phenological metrics derived from EVI time series data, and slope and elevation. For reference data, we visually interpreted percent cover of eight classes at locations with high-resolution QuickBird imagery in Google Earth. An adjustable majority cover threshold was used to assign samples to a dominant class. When compared to field data, we found this imagery to have georeferencing error <5% the length of a MODIS pixel, while most class interpretation error was related to confusion between agriculture and herbaceous vegetation. We used the Random Forests classifier to identify the best sets of predictor variables and percent cover thresholds for discriminating our LULC classes. The best variable set included all predictor variables and a cover threshold of 80%. This optimal Random Forests was used to map LULC for each year between 2001 and 2007, followed by a per-pixel, 3-year temporal filter to remove disallowed LULC transitions. Our sequence of maps had an overall accuracy of 79.3%, producer accuracy from 51.4% (plantation) to 95.8% (woody vegetation), and user accuracy from 58.9% (herbaceous vegetation) to 100.0% (water). We attributed map class confusion to limited spectral information, sub-pixel spectral mixing, georeferencing error and human error in interpreting reference samples. We used our maps to assess woody vegetation change in the Dry Chaco from 2002 to 2006, which was characterized by rapid deforestation related to soybean and planted pasture expansion. This method can be easily applied to other regions or continents to produce spatially and temporally consistent information on annual LULC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Phytoplankton pigments constitute many more compounds than chlorophyll a that can be applied to study phytoplankton diversity, populations, and primary production. In this study, field measurements were applied to develop ocean color satellite algorithms of phytoplankton pigments from in-water radiometry measurements. The match-up comparisons showed that the satellite-derived pigments from our algorithms agree reasonably well (e.g. 30-55% of uncertainty for SeaWiFS and 37-50% for MODIS-Aqua) to field data, with better agreement (e.g. 30-38% of uncertainty for SeaWiFS and 39-44% for MODIS-Aqua) for pigments abundant in diatoms. The seasonal and spatial variations of satellite-derived phytoplankton biomarker pigments, such as fucoxanthin, which is abundant in diatoms, peridinin, which is found only in peridinin-containing dinoflagellates, and zeaxanthin, which is primarily from cyanobacteria in coastal waters, revealed that higher densities of diatoms are more likely to occur on the inner shelf and during winter-spring and obscure other abundant phytoplankton groups. However, relatively higher densities of other phytoplankton, such as dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria, are likely to occur on the mid- to outer-continental shelf and during summer. Seasonal variation of riverine discharge may play an important role in stimulating algal blooms, in particular diatoms, while higher abundances of cyanobacteria coincide with warmer water temperatures and lower nutrient concentrations.

AB Permanent Scatterers Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (PSInSAR) and Global Position System (GPS) are applied to investigate the most recent surface deformation of the Campi Flegrei caldera. The PSInSAR analysis, based on SAR data acquired by ERS-1/2 sensors during the 1992-2001 time interval and by the Radarsat sensor during 2003-2007. identifies displacement patterns over wide areas with high spatial resolution. GPS data acquired by the Neapolitan Volcanic Continuous GPS network provide detailed ground velocity information of specific sites. The satellite-derived data allow us to characterize the deformation pattern that affected the Campi Flegrei caldera during two recent subsidence (1992-1999) and uplift (2005-2006) phases. PSInSAR results show the re-activation of the caldera ring-faults, intra-caldera faults. and eruptive fissures. We discuss the results in the light of the available volcanological, structural and geophysical data and propose a relationship between the structures activated during the recent unrest episodes and those responsible for the recent (<3.8-4 ka) volcanism. The combined interpretation of the collected data show that (a) the caldera consists of two sectors separated by a N-S striking faulting zone and (b) the intra-caldera NW-SE faults and eruptive fissures in the central-eastern sector re-activated during the studied unrest episodes and represent possible pathways for the ascent of magma and/or gas to the surface. In this sector, maximum horizontal strain, recent volcanism (3.8-4 ka), active degassing and seismicity concentrate. The fault re-activation is related to the dynamics of the caldera and not to tectonic stress. The deformation fields of the uplift and subsidence episodes are consistent with hydrothermal processes and degassing from a magmatic reservoir that is significantly smaller than the large (similar to 40 km(3)) magma chamber responsible for the caldera formation. We provide evidence that the monitoring of the horizontal and vertical components of deformation improves the identification of active, aseismic faults. Accordingly, we suggest that future ground deformation models should include the re-activation of the detected structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
