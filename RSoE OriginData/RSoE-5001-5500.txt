TI Water observations from space: Mapping surface water from 25 years of

AB Following extreme flooding in eastern Australia in 2011, the Australian Government established a programme to improve access to flood information across Australia. As part of this, a project was undertaken to map the extent of surface water across Australia using the multi-decadal archive of Landsat satellite imagery. A water detection algorithm was used based on a decision tree classifier, and a comparison methodology using a logistic regression. This approach provided an understanding of the confidence in the water observations. The results were used to map the presence of surface water across the entire continent from every observation of 27 years of satellite imagery. The Water Observation from Space (WOES) product provides insight into the behaviour of surface water across Australia through time, demonstrating where water is persistent, such as in reservoirs, and where it is ephemeral, such as on floodplains during a flood. In addition the WOfS product is useful for studies of wetland extent, aquatic species behaviour, hydrological models, land surface process modelling and groundwater recharge. This paper describes the WOES methodology and shows how similar time-series analyses of nationally significant environmental variables might be conducted at the continental scale.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a radiation flux emitted from chlorophyll molecules and is considered an indicator of the actual functional stata of plant photosynthesis. The remote measurement of SIF opens a new perspective to assess actual photosynthesis at larger, ecologically relevant scales and provides an alternative approach to study the terrestrial carbon cycle. Recent studies demonstrated the reliability of measured SIF signals and showed significant relationships between SIF and gross primary production (GPP) at ecosystem and global scales. Despite these encouraging results, understanding the complex mechanisms between SIF and GPP remains challenging before SIF can be finally utilized to constrain estimates of GPP. In this study, we present a comprehensive assessment of the relationship between far-red SIF retrieved at 760 nm (SIF760) and GPP, and its transferability across three structurally and physiologically contrasting ecosystems: perennial grassland, cropland and mixed temperate forest. We use multi-temporal imaging spectroscopy (IS) data acquired with the Airborne Prism EXperiment (APEX) sensor as well as eddy covariance (EC) flux tower data to evaluate the relationship between SIF760 and GPP(Ec). We use simulations performed with the coupled photosynthesis-fluorescence model SCOPE to prove trends obtained from our observational data and to assess apparent confounding factors such as physiological and structural interferences or temporal scaling effects. Observed relationships between SIF760 and GPPEc were asymptotic and ecosystem-specific, i.e., perennial grassland (R-2 = 0.59, rRMSE = 27.1%), cropland (R-2 = 0.88, rRMSE = 3.5%) and mixed temperate forest (R-2 = 0.48, rRMSE = 15.88%). We demonstrate that asymptotic leaf level relationships between SIF760 and GPPEc became more linear at canopy level and scaled with temporal aggregation. We conclude that remote sensing of SIF provides a new observational approach to decrease uncertainties in estimating GPP across ecosystems but requires dedicated strategies to compensate for the various confounding factors impacting SIF-GPP relationships. Our findings help in bridging the gap between mechanistic understanding at leaf level and ecosystem-specific observations of the relationships between SIF and GPP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Based on radiometer measurements of solar irradiance (direct and diffuse light) and Aeronet-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained at the Cape Verde atmospheric observatory during a major cloud-free dust outbreak event on February 7, 2012, the relationship between Saharan mineral dust outbreaks and a reduction of solar irradiance is quantified. The investigation is representative of the eastern subtropical North Atlantic region where the wind mobilization of mineral desert dust from the Sahara results in aerosol signals that are large enough to outweigh those from other aerosol types such as anthropogenic and marine aerosols. Ground-based estimates of AOD show frequency dependence as is expected from Mie theory. Our AOD signals agree well with satellite-based MODIS products and reveal AOD values exceeding 2.5 during the investigated dust storm event. We also demonstrate the use of satellite imagery with an atmospheric trajectory model to simulate time series of measurements at a given location. Using this approach, variations in AOD observed during February 7, 2012 can be rationalized as spatial inhomogeneities in the atmospheric dust load being advected laterally over the observing site. Our measurements suggest a dust forcing efficiency of around 90 W/m(2)/AOD at a wavelength of 380 nm, which is about 10-15% greater than reported in the literature indicative of a possible non-linear behavior at high AODs.

AB We tested the suitability and accuracy of hyperspectral data to produce the first African flowering and short-term floral cycle map. The spatial distribution and abundance, as well as the floral cycle, of melliferous plants are of utmost importance for evaluating pollination effects and to understand the relationship between melliferous plants in the landscape and the quantity and quality of bee keeping products. For a study site in Kenya, airborne AISA/Eagle hyperspectral data with 60 cm pixel resolution (400 to 990 nm spectral ranges) was captured in January 2014, at the beginning of the prime flowering period, and during the prime flowering period in February 2013. Aerial digital imagery with 10 cm pixel size and Smartphone captures in the field were used for reference data collection. The flowering species were grouped into functional flowering plant groups. Linear spectral unmixing and Change Vector Analysis (CVA) were used on the bi-temporal AISA/Eagle data to produce a hard cover map showing the spatial distribution, abundance and short-term flowering cycle of melliferous plants. Overall accuracies were slightly higher in the February 2013 imagery at the prime flowering period; all flowering plant groups together ("All") could be mapped with an overall accuracy of 83% (n = 512). The "White forbs" flowering plant group was most accurately mapped in both AISA/Eagle acquisition dates. Based on Duncan's inter-class similarity test, the "White forbs" group was also most distinct from other flowering plant groups. There is a need to investigate the effect of spectral endmember variability and upscaling options for space-borne monitoring of the floral cycle at key sites in Africa. Floral cycle maps can help decision makers and bee keepers to understand how bee colonies interact with the floral environment and what to expect from an apiary in terms of honey flow.

AB Land-surface modelling would benefit significantly from improved characterisation of the seasonal variability of vegetation at a global scale. GEOCLIM, a global climatology of leaf area index (LAD, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) both essential climate variables and fraction of vegetation cover (FCOVER), is here derived from observations from the SPOT VEGETATION programme. Interannual average values from the GEOV1 Copernicus Global Land time series of biophysical products at 1-km resolution and 10-day frequency are computed for 1999 to 2010. GEOCLIM provides the baseline characteristics of the seasonal cycle of the annual vegetation phenology for each 1-km pixel on the globe. The associated standard deviation characterises the interannual variability. Temporal consistency and continuity is achieved by the accumulation of multi-year observations and the application of techniques for temporal smoothing and gap filling. Specific corrections are applied over cloudy tropical regions and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere where the low number of available observations compromises the reliability of estimates. Artefacts over evergreen broadleaf forests and areas of bare soil are corrected based on the expected limited seasonality. The GEOCLIM data set is demonstrated to be consistent, both spatially and temporally. GEOCLIM shows absolute differences lower than 0.5 compared with MODIS (GIMMS3g) climatology of LAI for more than 80% (90%) of land pixels, with higher discrepancies in tropical and boreal latitudes. ECOCLIMAP systematically produces higher LAI values. The phenological metric for the date of maximum foliar development derived from GEOCLIM is spatially consistent (correlation higher than 0.9) with those of MODIS, GIMMS3g, ECOCLIMAP and MCD12Q2 with average differences within 14 days at the global scale.

AB We report the latest study for small glaciers, using Turkey as an example, and update previous studies of glaciers in Turkey from the 1970s to 2012-2013. We used seventy-two Landsat scenes from the Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Return Beam Vidicon-3 (RBV-3), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+), and Operational Land Imager (OLI); five Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images; and forty-one commercial satellite images. IKONOS, Quickbird-2, GeoEye-1, and WorldView-1 and -2 commercial satellite images were used to evaluate mapping accuracies, to understand debris-covered glacial margins, to map glacier margins in shadows, and to better determine the area of the smaller glaciers in Turkey. We also used nine Landsat-5 simultaneously acquired TM and MSS images to more accurately process MSS imagery from the 1970s. The area of the glaciers in Turkey decreased from 25 km(2) in the 1970s to 10.85 km(2) in 2012-2013. By 2012-2013, five glaciers had disappeared, six were less than 0.5 km(2), one was 0.8 km(2), and only two were 3.0 km(2) or larger. No trends in 1980 to 2012 annual precipitation, 1980 to 2012 winter precipitation, and 1980 to 2008 cloud cover extent were found, while surface temperatures increased, with summer minimum temperatures showing the greatest increases. We attribute glacier recession in Turkey from the 1970s to 2012-2013 to increasing summer minimum temperatures with no changes in precipitation or cloud cover over this time period.

AB The harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) algorithm has been widely used to reconstruct time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Leaf area index (LAI), and land surface temperature (LST) as well as the polarization difference brightness temperature (PDBT) during the past 20 years to remove random noise or eliminate cloud/snow contamination. So far no systematic study on the accuracy of such reconstruction has been done. This study aims at taking the global MODIS vegetation index as an example to develop a generic method to evaluate the reconstruction performance of HANTS. The overall reconstruction error was divided into gap related error and fitting-method related error. Firstly, ten annual NDVI time series for a pixel were used to extract reference series and gap statistics. Then the gap and fitting-method related errors were quantified independently. The results suggest that the gap related error for most of the high latitude forest area (between 50 degrees N and 70 degrees N) was rather large (the mean root mean squared deviation (RMSD) reached to 0.15), which may be attributed to the fact that large gaps appear in the NDVI profiles between snow melting and vegetation regreening season. The gap related error was found negligible for the other areas of the globe except the North China Plain, the North India and several mountainous areas where the mean RMSD is around 0.1. The inadequate capability of low frequency harmonics to capture the rapid transition during snowmelt in spring at the high latitude region of the North Hemisphere makes the fitting-method related error in this region rather large (RMSD can reach 0.1). The method developed in this study was applied to map globally the spatial pattern of HANTS performance in the reconstruction of NDVI time series and it can also be applied to evaluate the reconstruction performance of time series of other land surface variables or the performance of other time series reconstruction algorithms.

AB This study tests the performance of spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) for estimation of green vegetation (GV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil fractions in the heterogeneous, structurally complex savannas of the western Kalahari using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) nadir-bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) adjusted reflectance (NBAR) product. Extensive fieldwork took place during the dry and wet seasons of 2009 to 2011 at 15 sites distributed along a 950 km long transect, stretching across western Botswana, each site was visited once during the wet season and once during the dry season. Data collection included a traditional line-intercept transect (LPIT) and a new spectral line point intercept transect method (SLPIT) were used to test the performance of a variety of unmixing procedures (MESMA vs. SMA) and endmember models. The results for this structurally complex landscape are consistent with results from similar studies undertaken in more homogeneous areas. GV cover was retrieved much more accurately than NPV or soil cover. MESMA also produced estimates of fractional cover with less error than simple SMA. However, the errors observed are greater than those observed for more homogeneous environments. Unlike the line-point intercept method, which requires user interpretation of vegetation greenness, the new method uses spectral data collected across the entire reflected solar spectrum to derive estimates of GV, NPV and soil fractional cover through spectral unmixing. Our results show that that the SLPIT fractions generally agree better with remotely-derived fractions than the LPIT-derived fractions. However, remote sensing of GV, NPV, and soil fractional cover, especially in heterogeneous landscapes and at the spatial resolution of MODIS, remains challenging. Nonetheless, the data do show that at this resolution various unmixing methods have the potential to inform our understanding of ecosystem dynamics in these environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Monitoring of water quality by satellite ocean colour data requires high quality atmospheric correction and especially the accurate quantification of the aerosol contribution to the top of atmosphere radiance. Several methods have been proposed for atmospheric correction over turbid waters, including modelling the marine contributions to the NIR signal or switching to longer short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelengths where the signal even in turbid waters can be assumed zero. Here we present the use of the high quality SWIR bands of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat-8, launched in 2013, to extend our existing turbid water atmospheric correction to extremely turbid waters. The atmospheric correction is image based, and no external measurements are required. The aerosol type is estimated using NIR and SWIR bands in clear water pixels, or in all water pixels using the two SWIR bands. The aerosol type is assumed to be constant over a single Landsat-8 tile (170 by 185 km), or allowed to vary spatially when using both SWIR bands. Realistic spatial patterns of marine reflectances are retrieved, uncorrelated with the estimated aerosol reflectance. Taking spatial and temporal variability into account, products from Landsat-8 compare well with those of MODIS Aqua and Terra also using the SWIR bands for atmospheric correction. The limitations of our previously published method (Vanhellemont & Ruddick, 2014a) are illustrated at higher turbidities, and removed by using the new method. The uncertainty caused by using a single aerosol type per scene is assessed. The advantages of the high spatial resolution L8/OLI data are clear for applications in coastal and estuarine waters. As an example of the advantage of high quality SWIR bands, and a SWIR-based atmospheric correction, an algorithm for detecting black suspended sediments from dredging and dumping operations is demonstrated here. In conclusion, L8/OLI is a powerful new tool for remote sensing of extremely turbid waters, and can be used as a precursor for future ocean colour missions with SWIR bands. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB We show, for the first time over the Greenland ice sheet, that an along track method for deriving rates of elevation change can successfully be applied to Envisat radar altimetry data (2002-2010). The results provide improved resolution and coverage compared to previous results obtained from cross-over methods.
   Also, we find that temporal changes in the elevation change rate can be derived from Envisat data, and show clear examples of this by generating five-year running means for selected areas of the Greenland ice sheet. For a period between 2003 and 2009, the elevation of the ice sheets was measured by both the laser altimeter on board ICESat and the radar altimeter on board Envisat We compare rates of elevation change derived from ICESat and Envisat for this time span in which both sensors were operating. We focus on the area above the equilibrium line altitude, in order to specifically derive information on snow parameters. A comparison of the elevation changes observed by the two sensors shows a complex pattern, which can be explained regionally by model output describing the changes in both firn-air content and accumulation rates.

AB This study presents a comprehensive comparison of radar signatures acquired over West Africa (between latitudes 0 degrees-25 degrees N and longitudes 5 degrees W-25 degrees E) at both C- and Ku-bands using nadir-looking altimeters (35-day orbital period ENVISAT RA-2 over 2003-2010 and 10-day orbital period Jason-2 over mid-2008-2011) and side-looking scatterometers (QuikSCAT over 2003-2009 and ASCAT over mid-2008-2011) that covers the major biodimatic zones, soil and vegetation types encountered in this region.
   The backscattering coefficient's time series measured by both radar instruments are generated over regional transects and local sites. Meridian transects from the wet tropics to the arid regions of the Sahara desert demonstrate the spatial and temporal changes of the radar response over the West African bioclimatic gradient in terms of surface roughness, land cover and soil wetness. Nadir-looking altimetry appears more sensitive to variations of surface soil moisture than side-looking scatterometry at both C- and Ku-bands. In contrast the impact of vegetation on the backscattered signals is found to be lower for nadir-looking instruments compared to side-looking ones. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Gas flaring has gained global recognition as a prominent agent of pollution, leading to the establishment of the Global Gas Flaring Reduction (GGFR) initiative, which requires an objective means of monitoring flaring activity. Because auditable information on flaring activity is difficult to obtain there have recently been attempts to detect flares using satellite imagery, typically at global scales. However, to adequately assess the environmental and health impacts of flaring from local to regional scales, it is important that we have a means of acquiring information on the location of individual active flaring sites and the volume of gas combusted at these sites. In this study we developed an approach to the retrieval of such information using nighttime MODIS thermal imagery. The MODIS flare detection technique (MODET) and the MODIS flare volume estimation technique (MOVET) both exploit the absolute and contextual radiometric response of flare sites. The levels of detection accuracy and estimation error were quantified using independent observations of flare location and volume. The MODET and MOVET were applied to an archive of MODIS data spanning 2000-2014 covering the Niger Delta, Nigeria, a significant global hotspot of flaring activity. The results demonstrate the substantial spatial and temporal variability in gas flaring across the region, between states and between onshore and offshore sites. Thus, whilst the estimated total volume of gas flared in the region over the study period is large (350 Billion Cubic Metres), the heterogeneity in the flaring indicates that the impacts of such flares will be highly variable in space and time. In this context, the MODET and MOVET offer a consistent and objective means of monitoring flaring activity over an appropriate range of scales and it is now important that their robustness and transferability is tested in other oil-producing regions of the world.

AB The upcoming hyperspectral satellite mission Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) will provide timely and globally sampled imaging spectrometer data on a frequent basis. This will create unprecedented opportunities for a variety of environmental research fields and lead to manifold novel applications. These opportunities specifically apply to challenging environments, including heterogeneous urban landscapes. In this paper, we explored the potential of EnMAP data for quantifying land cover along the urban-rural gradient of Berlin, Germany. Land cover fraction maps from a simulated EnMAP scene at 30 m spatial resolution were derived based on support vector regression (SVR) combined with synthetically mixed training data. Results demonstrate that EnMAP imagery will be well suited for mapping impervious, vegetation and soil surface types according to the VIS framework. Moreover, EnMAP data will allow extending the VIS framework by more detailed sub-categories such as roof and pavement, or low vegetation and tree. However, we advise caution that spaceborne imaging spectrometer data of improved quality will not completely help to overcome well known phenomena of spectral similarity between materials and spectral confusion caused by the presence of shaded areas. To identify possible benefits and limitations of EnMAP data, comparisons to fraction maps derived from a higher resolution Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap) image at 9 m spatial resolution and a multispectral Landsat ETM +-like image at 30 m spatial resolution were drawn. First, we demonstrate that both VIS and extended VIS mapping reveal similar accuracies compared to maps from spatially higher resolution data. Second, we illustrate the superiority of the higher spectral information content for improved and extended urban land cover mapping compared to multispectral data. Overall, this study provides important insights into the potential of spaceborne imaging spectrometer and specifically future EnMAP data for urban remote sensing.

AB Inland waters across the United States (US) are at potential risk for increased outbreaks of toxic cyanobacteria blooms events resulting from elevated water temperatures and extreme hydrologic events attributable to climate change and increased nutrient loadings associated with intensive agricultural practices. Current monitoring efforts are limited in scope due to resource limitations, analytical complexity, and data integration efforts. The goals of this study were to validate an algorithm for satellite imagery that could potentially be used to monitor surface cyanobacteria events in near real-time to provide a compressive monitoring capability for freshwater lakes (>100 ha). The algorithm incorporated narrow spectral bands specific to the European Space Agency's (ESA's) MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) instrument that were optimally oriented at phytoplankton pigment absorption features including phycocyanm at 620 nm. A validation of derived cyanobacteria cell counts was performed using available in situ data assembled from existing monitoring programs across eight states in the eastern US over a 39-month period (2009-2012). Results indicated that MERIS provided robust estimates for low (10,000-109,000 cells/mL) and very high (>1,000,000 cells/mL) cell enumeration ranges (approximately 90% and 83%, respectively). However, the results for two intermediate ranges (110,000-299,000 and 300,000-1,000,000 cells/mL) were substandard, at approximately 28% and 40%, respectively. The confusion associated with intermediate cyanobacteria cell count ranges was largely attributed to the lack of available taxonomic data and distinction of natural counting units for the in situ measurements that would have facilitated conversions between cell counts and cell volumes. The results of this study document the potential for using MERIS-derived cyanobacteria cell count estimates to monitor freshwater lakes (>100 ha) across the eastern US. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB A fundamental measure to characterize water quality is the attenuation coefficient for downward planar irradiance in the water column. In this paper we present an analytical forward model and develop an inversion scheme (2SeaColor) to retrieve the downwelling attenuation coefficients from remote sensing data. The forward formulation of 2SeaColor provides an analytical and stable solution of the direct and diffuse components of the radiative transfer equation. The common high turbidity of inland waters is accounted for in 2SeaColor by projecting its effect on the inherent optical properties (IOPs) using the similarity transform. The inversion scheme of 2SeaColor uses a novel approach to parameterize the spectral dependency of IOPs. In this parameterization 2SeaColor uses the curvature information of observed remote sensing spectra to deduce the spectral-shape of the total absorption coefficient.
   The forward model is verified using simulated data from the International Ocean Colour Coordinating Group (IOCCG data) and is compared with two existing models.
   Statistical analysis results of model verification show that the forward model is able to derive K-d values with 3% accuracy (relative mean absolute error). Our solution provides an improvement on the accuracy of the estimated Kd when compared to other models, and especially at larger depths. The inversion scheme is validated against three sets of data: IOCCG, field measured and satellite observed matchups. Field measurements were collected in the turbid Naivasha Lake, Kenya. The mean absolute relative error in the derived K-d in all data sets did not exceed 15%, with the satellite matchup set resulting in the largest discrepancy.
   The developed model, 2SeaColor, is stable to noise up to 15% and consistently produces accurate results which make it an ideal candidate model for the future Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board the Sentinel-3 mission. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wildlife habitat mapping has evolved at a rapid pace over the last few decades. Beginning with simple, often subjective, hand-drawn maps, habitat mapping now involves complex species distribution models (SDMs) using mapped predictor variables derived from remotely sensed data For species that inhabit large geographic areas, remote sensing technology is often essential for producing range wide maps. Habitat monitoring for northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina), whose geographic covers about 23 million ha, is based on SDMs that use Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery to create forest vegetation data layers using gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) methods. Vegetation data layers derived from GNN are modeled relationships between forest inventory plot data, climate and topographic data, and the spectral signatures acquired by the satellite. When used as predictor variables for SDMs, there is some transference of the GNN modeling error to the final habitat map.
   Recent increases in the use of light detection and ranging (lidar) data, coupled with the need to produce spatially accurate and detailed forest vegetation maps have spurred interest in its use for SDMs and habitat mapping. Instead of modeling predictor variables from remotely sensed spectral data, lidar provides direct measurements of vegetation height for use in SDMs. We expect a SDM habitat map produced from directly measured predictor variables to be more accurate than one produced from modeled predictors.
   We used maximum entropy (Maxent) SDM modeling software to compare predictive performance and estimates of habitat area between Landsat-based and lidar-based northern spotted owl SDMs and habitat maps.
   We explored the differences and similarities between these maps, and to a pre-existing aerial photo-interpreted habitat map produced by local wildlife biologists. The lidar-based map had the highest predictive performance based on 10 bootstrapped replicate models (AUC = 0.809 +/- 0.011), but the performance of the Landsat-based map was within acceptable limits (AUC = 0.717 +/- 0.021). As is common with photo-interpreted maps, there was no accuracy assessment available for comparison. The photo-interpreted map produced the highest and lowest estimates of habitat area, depending on which habitat classes were included (nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat = 9962 ha, nesting habitat only = 6036 ha). The Landsat-based map produced an estimate of habitat area that was within this range (95% CI: 6679-9592 ha), while the lidar-based map produced an area estimate similar to what was interpreted by local wildlife biologists as nesting (i.e., high quality) habitat using aerial imagery (95% CI: 5453-7216). Confidence intervals of habitat area estimates from the SDMs based on Landsat and lidar overlapped.
   We concluded that both Landsat- and lidar-based SDMs produced reasonable maps and area estimates for northern spotted owl habitat within the study area. The lidar-based map was more precise and spatially similar to what local wildlife biologists considered spotted owl nesting habitat. The Landsat-based map provided a less precise spatial representation of habitat within the relatively small geographic confines of the study area, but habitat area estimates were similar to both the photo-interpreted and lidar-based maps. Photo-interpreted maps are time consuming to produce, subjective in nature, and difficult to replicate. SDMs provide a framework for efficiently producing habitat maps that can be replicated as habitat conditions change over time, provided that comparable remotely sensed data are available. When the SDM uses predictor variables extracted from lidar data, it can produce a habitat map that is both accurate and useful at large and small spatial scales. In comparison, SDMs using Landsat-based data are more appropriate for large scale analyses of amounts and general spatial patterns of habitat at regional scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Fusion of optical and SAR time series imagery has the potential to improve forest monitoring in tropical regions, where cloud cover limits optical satellite time series observations. We present a novel pixel-based Multi-sensor Time-series correlation and Fusion approach (MulTiFuse) that exploits the full observation density of optical and SAR time series. We model the relationship of two overlapping univariate time series using an optimized weighted correlation. The resulting optimized regression model is used to predict and fuse two time series. Using the MulTiFuse approach we fused Landsat NDVI and ALOS PALSAR L-band backscatter time series. We subsequently used the fused time series in a multi-sensor change detection framework to detect deforestation between 01/2008 - 09/2010 at a managed forest plantation in the tropics (Pinus caribea; 2859 ha). 3-monthly reference data covering the entire study area was used to validate and assess spatial and temporal accuracy. We tested the impact of persistent cloud cover by increasing the per-pixel missing data percentage of the NDVI time series stepwise from similar to 53% (similar to 6 observations/year) up to 95% (similar to 0.5 observation/year) while fusing with a consistent PALSAR time series of similar to 2 observations/year. A significant linear correlation was found between the Landsat NDVI and ALOS PALSAR L-band SAR time series observables for logged forest. The multi-temporal filtered PALSAR HVHH backscatter ratio time series (HVHHmt) was most strongly correlated with the NDVI time series. While for Landsat-only the spatial and temporal accuracy of detected deforestation decreased significantly with increasing missing data, the accuracies for the fused NDVI-PALSAR case remained high and were observed to be above the NDVI- and PALSAR-only cases for all missing data percentages. For the fused NDVI-HVHHmt time series the overall accuracy was 95.5% with a 1.59 month mean time lag of detected changes. The MulTiFuse approach is robust and automated, and it provides the opportunity to use the upcoming data streams of free-of charge, medium resolution optical and SAR satellite imagery in a beneficial way for improved tropical forest monitoring.

AB Surface albedo is an essential parameter not only for developing climate models, but also for most energy balance studies. While climate models are usually applied at coarse resolution, the energy balance studies, which are mainly focused on agricultural applications, require a high spatial resolution. In this context Landsat is one of the most used remote sensing sensors.
   The albedo, estimated through the angular integration of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), requires an appropriate angular sampling of the surface. However, Landsat sampling characteristics, with nearly constant observation geometry and low illumination variation, prevent from deriving a surface albedo product.
   In this paper we present an algorithm to derive a Landsat surface albedo based on the BRDF parameters estimated from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) surface reflectance product (M{O,Y}D09) using the VJB method (Vermote, Justice, & Breon, 2009). We base our method on Landsat unsupervised classification to disaggregate the BRDF parameters to the Landsat spatial resolution. We tested the proposed algorithm over five different sites of the US Surface Radiation (SURFRAD) network and inter-compare our results with Shuai, Masek, Gao, and Schaaf (2011) method, which also provides Landsat albedo. The results show that with the proposed method we can derive the surface albedo with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.015 (7%). This result supposes an improvement of 5% in the RMSE compared to Shuai et al.'s (2011) method (with a RMSE of 0.024, 12%) that is mainly determined by the correction of the negative bias (lower retrieved albedo than in situ data).

AB Landsat Thematic Mapper and Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) satellite based optical sensors, NASA Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) polarimetric SAR (PolSAR), and field data captured the occurrence and the recovery of an undetected dieback that occurred between the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012 in the Spartina alterniflora marshes of coastal Louisiana. Field measurements recorded the dramatic biomass decrease from 2010 to 2011 and a biomass recovery in 2012 dominated by a decrease of live biomass, and the loss of marsh as part of the dieback event. Based on an established relationship, the near-infrared/red vegetation index (VI) and site-specific measurements delineated a contiguous expanse of marsh dieback encompassing 6649.9 ha of 18,2923 ha of S. alterniflora marshes within the study region. PoISAR data were transformed to variables used in biophysical mapping, and of this variable suite, the cross-polarization HV (horizontal send and vertical receive) backscatter was the best single indicator of marsh dieback and recovery. HV backscatter exhibited substantial and significant changes over the dieback and recovery period, tracked measured biomass changes, and significantly correlated with the live/dead biomass ratio. Within the context of regional trends, both HV and VI indicators started higher in pre-dieback marshes and exhibited substantially and statistically higher variability from year to year than that exhibited in the non-dieback marshes. That distinct difference allowed the capturing of the S. altemiflora marsh dieback and recovery; however, these changes were incorporated in a regional trend exhibiting similar but more subtle biomass composition changes.

AB Most active fire detection algorithms applied to data from geostationary Earth Observation (EO) satellites are adjustments of those originally developed for polar-orbiting systems, and thus the high temporal imaging frequencies offered from geostationary systems are often not fully utilized within such detection approaches. Here we present a new active fire detection algorithm that fully exploits geostationary data's temporal dimension, including both for detecting actively burning fires and quantifying their fire radiative power (FRP). The approach uses a robust matching algorithm to model each pixels diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) in the middle infra-red (MIR) spectral band, the most important band for active fire detection. For each pixel, a Kalman filter (KF) is used to blend the set of basis DTCs with the actual geostationary observations during times of confirmed cloud-and fire-free measurements, allowing for estimates of the pixels true non-fire 'background' signal to be provided throughout the day, even when a fire maybe present. This is different to the standard 'spatial contextual' approach, where the non-fire background signal is estimated from nearby non-fire pixels. A series of spectral thresholds are then applied to the analyzed pixel in order to identify whether the actual observation departs sufficiently from the estimated non-fire signal to confidently suggest that the pixel contains an active fire. If it does, the difference between the fire pixel and non-fire background signal estimate in the MIR is used to estimate the fire radiative power (FRP) output. We apply this new 'Kalman Filter Algorithm' (KFA) to one month of African imagery acquired by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), which is carried onboard the geostationary Meteosat satellite. We compare the resulting active fire detections and FRPs to those produced using the prototype (offline) version of the 'spatial contextual' based 'Fire Thermal Anomalies' (FTA) algorithm, here termed the pFTA, now used to generate the operational SEVIRI FRP-PIXEL product in the EUMETSAT Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility (http://landsaf.meteo.pt/), and also compare results to simultaneous detections from the MODIS MOD14/MYD14 active fire products. The KFA shows some advantages over the pFTA algorithm, detecting a greater number of fire pixels, up to similar to 80% more at the peak of the diurnal fire cycle. These additional fire pixels are primarily low FRP fires (<30 MW), which results in the overall fire radiative energy (FRE) increasing by only 20% compared to the pFTA algorithm, though this is still a substantial difference. Comparison against simultaneous MODIS active fire observations confirms that the KFA detects more of the MODIS-detected active fires than does the pFTA (60% more), but at the expense of doubling the false alarm rate. Analysis of the ability of the KFA to aid in the estimation of FRP by providing a more certain estimate of the fire pixels background signal indicates a small 0.2 K reduction (rmsd) between the 'estimate' of the background temperature and the 'truth'. One limitation of the KFA approach currently is that it is computationally costly, and also requires the full day diurnal variation to be measured prior to the multi-temporal fire detection process. In its present form it is therefore unsuited to the generation of real-time products.
   We recommend future work concentrate on extracting maximum performance and utility of geostationary active fire observations by blending both 'spatial contextual' and 'multi-temporal' approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data provide a global, long-term, consistent time series with favorable spectral and spatial resolution. Such measurements are necessary for climate change studies. However, significant problems with the AVHRR calibration have been seen in two separate sources of early AVHRR data lack onboard calibration and observed trends and biases when the AVHRR radiances are compared with other accurate top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiances sources. In this paper, new calibration coefficients for channels 1 and 2 of the AVHRR sensors onboard 16 NOM satellites from TIROS-N, NOAA-6 to NOAA-19, and Metop-A, B are reported. The calibration slopes are derived based on several pseudo-invariant sites endorsed by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS) channels 6 and 8 radiance data are applied in characterizing the bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDF) of the TOA reflectance over the employed targets, and MODTRAN simulations are carried out to parameterize the spectral channel adjustment factors (SBAFs) between SeaWiFS and each AVHRR sensor to eliminate the spectral response differences over different targets considering the impacts of observing geometries and gaseous absorption. The BRDFs and SBAFs are then applied to filtered AVHRR time-series to generate time series of calibration slopes presented in the form of quadratic polynomials as a function of time and applied in the recalibration of AVHRR data records. Comparisons with calibration coefficients generated from other products exhibit preferable validity and consistency, and notable incoherence and trend in the TOA reflectance time series of the L1B AVHRR data over each site from all the launched NOAA series polar orbiting satellites are largely eliminated after the recalibration. The long-term and inter-sensor consistent AVHRR data records after this post calibration can provide valuable insight into global climate changes since 1978.

AB Tree species display different abundance patterns over the landscape due to a number of hierarchical factors, all of which have implications when modeling their distribution. While climate is often the primary driver for global to regional scale tree species distributions, modeling of presence and abundance patterns at finer scales, and in landscapes with less topographic variation may require predictors that capture biotic processes and local abiotic conditions. Proxies for biotic and disturbance processes may be captured by a combination of multispectral remote sensing and light detection and ranging (WAR) data. LiDAR data have shown great potential for capturing three-dimensional (3D) characteristics of the forest canopy and a number of these characteristics may have strong relationships with drivers of local tree species distributions. The objective of this study was to investigate the importance of remote sensing derived variables related to biotic and disturbance processes in predicting fine-scale abundance patterns of several dominant tree species in a mixed mature forest in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Forest Region, Ontario, Canada. Boosted regression trees, an ensemble classification and regression algorithm, was used to compare tree species abundance models that included LiDAR derived topographic variables with models that included spectral and LiDAR derived topographic and vegetation variables. Average model fit (rescaled Nagelkerke R-2) and predictive accuracy (correlation) improved from 0.12 to 0.63 and 0.25 to 0.71, respectively, when spectral and LiDAR derived vegetation variables were included in the tree species abundance models. This indicates that these variables capture some of the variance in local tree species' abundance distributions generated by biotic and disturbance processes in a landscape with limited topographic and climatic variation. Decreased model performance at higher tree species' abundances additionally suggests that our models do not capture all of the local drivers of tree species' abundance. Variables related to historical and current silvicultural practices may be missing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Analysts utilize a variety of datasets to manually derive the daily extent of snow, ice, water and land, available at both 24 and 4 km. The 4 km IMS product was assessed for 2004-2008 against several previously established melt/freeze algorithms using Scatterometer Image Reconstruction (SIR) SeaWinds/QuikSCAT (QuikSCAT) backscatter (sigma degrees), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) brightness temperature (T-B) measurements, data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Image data (SSM/I) and sea ice concentrations derived from DMSP Special Sensor Microwave/Imager-Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMI-SSMIS) data (NASATeam dataset). The resolution possible with the 4 km IMS product allows for better spatial representation of sea ice along the coastlines, the ice edges and in the narrow channels of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago as compared to the microwave products. IMS detects open water earlier and freeze onset later than the automated microwave products, and also allows for the detection of opening, and the subsequent closing, of leads that the other datasets are unable to detect. Using RADARSAT-1 imagery for evaluation, IMS is shown to outperform the other datasets for the timing and extent of the first open water detection. IMS identified between 17 and 53% greater open water coverage than the other datasets in the narrow channels of the Northwest Passage (Barrow Strait). In order to further the use of IMS for sea ice applications, we derived two new spatial datasets using the full record of IMS data (4 km: 2004-present 24 km: 1997-present): melt duration to open water (duration from melt onset detected with SSM/I passive microwave until open water detected by IMS) and first year ice cover duration (duration from freeze onset until open water, both detected by IMS).

AB The Soil Moisture/Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite, launched in November 2009, measures visibilities at L-band, from which brightness temperatures are computed. This information is used to retrieve values of the sea surface salinity (SSS) and soil moisture; two variables whose observation is a key to better understand the oceanic component of the water cycle. A hierarchy of SSS products has been defined in the SMOS data processing chain. This work focuses on the so-called Level 3 (binned maps of SSS) and Level 4 (products combining SMOS data with any other source of information). The objective is to illustrate the feasibility of using data assimilation to produce Level 4 maps of sea surface salinity. The numerical model will increase the geophysical coherence of SMOS data as a dynamical interpolator. Here, the employment of data assimilation differs from its usual applications (improving model outputs for example). Indeed, the numerical model will interpolate the observations according to the general laws of fluid mechanics and, if possible, reduce the error contained in the original observations. The data assimilation method analyzed is a nudging algorithm. The domain of application for this feasibility study is the Northeast subtropical Atlantic gyre, a challenging region due to the presence of a large amount of noise that deteriorates the SMOS data. The main sources of errors are the vicinity of large landmasses that introduce a spurious bias, and the presence of a significant amount of artificial radio frequency interferences (RFI). While the Quality Controls already set up in the SMOS processing chain do filter the retrievals containing too large errors, wrong data are still present in Level 3 maps. Despite this difficulty, the results provide meaningful SMOS SSS Level 4 products in terms of their geophysical coherence (estimated using singularity analysis) and better agreement with in-situ data than Level 3 product.

AB The updated Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) third generation global satellite Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset provides very detailed global information on the state of vegetation from 1982 to 2011. Using these data we investigated the changes in the vegetation photosynthetic activity in the Asia-Pacific (AP) (including Australia, South East Asia, China, and the Pacific Coast of North America) region, by discerning gradual changes into two key metrics: 1) the cumulative annual NDVI in each year and 2) the seasonality or variance in that index. We then assessed changes using break and turning points using three statistical models (least-square linear, expanded paired-consecutive linear and piecewise regression models). We found that the AP region overall experienced increasing NDVI from 1982 through 2011 with an average rate of 530 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1) (0.13% yr(-1)). The annual NDVI increased from 1982 at a faster rate of 26.14 x 10(-4) NDVI yr-1 (0.65% yr(-1)) until a break in the trend after 1991 (after that the trend reduced to 5.78 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1)). In the Asia-Australia (AA) subarea of the AP, vegetation greening slowly increased at 8.71 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1) before 2003 and then increased to 28.30 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1) after 2003. In contrast, in the North America (NA) subarea NDVI rapidly increased initially at 18.72 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1) before 1992 and then marginally increased (3.96 x 10(-4) NDVI yr(-1)) after 1992. The turning points were found to be 2008 and 1987 for the AA and NA subareas respectively. Analysis of monthly NDVI data showed that the trends were positive for most of the months of the study period, particularly during the growing season. Geospatial analyses demonstrated that cumulative annual NDVI and the variance or seasonality across the large AP region varied across the different subareas. As well, we found evidence for different spatial patterns of the NDVI changes with strong spatial heterogeneity in the patterns of the break and turning points. This suggests complex and nonlinear responses of vegetation photosynthetic activity to regional climatic changes and other drivers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The 2008 global burned area product MODIS-MCD45 was validated and accuracy measures were estimated globally and for several terrestrial biomes. Stratified random sampling was used to select 102 non-overlapping Thiessen scene areas (TSA) and reference fire perimeters were determined from two multi-temporal Landsat TM/ETM+ images for each sampled TSA. Error matrices and six accuracy measures were chosen to satisfy criteria specified by end-users of burned area products. Globally, MODIS-MCD45 had estimated commission and omission error rates of 46% and 72% respectively, and a Dice coefficient of 0.37. Burned area extent tended to be underestimated as the MODIS product detected an estimated 48% of the burned area as determined from the reference data. The two biomes with highest accuracy were Boreal Forest and Tropical & Subtropical savanna, two of the most fire-prone biomes. In general, accuracy slightly improved in those areas where burned area was more prevalent. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Forest management seeks sustainability for a diverse set of goals, including economic objectives, provision of ecosystem services, and provision of a variety of possible land uses. It is important to quantify, map and monitor forest dynamics resulting from natural and anthropogenic processes over time periods appropriate to the temporal scale of change as well as to land management goals and decision making. This paper presents temporal trend analyses of temperate mixed forest dynamics in Gatineau Park, Quebec, Canada, using a time series of Landsat 5 TM scenes. Several vegetation indices were first evaluated as indicators of field measured vegetation abundance parameters such as leaf area index, canopy openness, DBH, and basal area. Of these, Tasseled Cap Wetness (TON) provided the best relationships (e.g., r = 0.81 against LAI) and it differentiated between coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests. Thirteen clear sky 5 TM scenes from the growing seasons of 1987 to 2010 were relatively calibrated and assembled into an image time-series. TCW applied to the image time-series followed by Theil-Sen and Contextual Mann-Kendall trend analysis detected subtle and gradual field-verified forest change. Gradual and abrupt forest decline or regrowth periods were identified; over the full period, 641 ha (1.8% of the park) exhibited statistically significant growth, and 689 ha (1.9%) exhibited decline. Mapping the timing, location, magnitude, and duration of forest change will help inform land management policy and actions within Gatineau Park and such methods may be applied in other similar forests.

AB Previous studies showed that fine particulate matter (PM2.5, particles smaller than 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) is associated with various health outcomes. Ground in situ measurements of PM2.5 concentrations are considered to be the gold standard, but are time-consuming and costly. Satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have the potential to supplement the ground monitoring networks to provide spatiotemporally-resolved PM2.5 exposure estimates. However, the coarse resolutions (e.g., 10 km) of the satellite AOD products used in previous studies make it very difficult to estimate urban-scale PM2.5 characteristics that are crucial to population-based PM2.5 health effects research. In this paper, a new aerosol product with 1 km spatial resolution derived by the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm was examined using a two-stage spatial statistical model with meteorological fields (e.g., wind speed) and land use parameters (e.g., forest cover, road length, elevation, and point emissions) as ancillary variables to estimate daily mean PM2.5 concentrations. The study area is the southeastern U.S., and data for 2003 were collected from various sources. A cross validation approach was implemented for model validation. We obtained R-2 of 0.83, mean prediction error (MPE) of 1.89 mu g/m(3), and square root of the mean squared prediction errors (RMSPE) of 2.73 mu g/m(3) in model fitting, and R-2 of 0.67, MPE of 2.54 mu g/m(3), and RMSPE of 3.88 mu g/m(3) in cross validation.

AB Post-stratification is commonly used to improve the precision of survey estimates. In traditional post-stratification methods, the stratification variable must be known at the population level. When suitable covariates are available at the population level, an alternative approach consists of fitting a model on the covariates, making predictions for the population and then stratifying on these predicted values. This method is called Endogenous Post-Stratification Estimation (EPSE) and it is well suited for applications using remote sensing data. In this article, we investigate the performance of EPSE in a realistic setting using data from the United States Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus. This article has three specific objectives: first, to evaluate the statistical properties of EPSE when using linear regression, spline regression, and the machine learning tool Random Forest to predict tree canopy cover using remote sensing and Geographic Information System data; second, to investigate the effect on the EPSE variance estimator using estimated stratum boundaries instead of fixed stratum boundaries; and third, to investigate the effect on the EPSE variance estimator when optimizing the stratum boundaries to minimize the variance estimate. The main findings of this article are that the EPSE variance estimator performs well using Random Forests, but can underestimate the true variance if an optimization is performed on the stratum boundaries in an attempt to minimize the variance estimate. This result supports the use of the EPSE estimator using remote sensing data in cases where there is no optimization on the variance estimator. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB State and local governments in China have implemented a series of grassland protection policies to address the problem of grassland degradation. In 2003, Ningxia was the first province to implement a province-wide grazing ban. The effect of this ban is contentious at all levels of government and has become a topic of public concern. Grassland desertification is the most direct indicator of the effect of the grazing ban. We selected 14 counties and cities in north-central Ningxia as the study area. A desertification classification and grading system for Ningxia's grassland was then designed based on fieldwork and expert review. Using the Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) and decision-tree methods, we interpreted Landsat TM/ETM + images of the study area during four years: 1993, 2000, 2006 and 2011. The following results were obtained: from 1993 to 2011, the area of desertified grassland in north-central Ningxia decreased gradually from 8702 km(2) in 1993 to 7485 km(2) in 2011, a decrease of 13.98%; the degree of desertification gradually decreased from 3573 km(2) of severely desertified grassland in 1993 to 1450 km(2) in 2011, a decrease of 59.41%; desertified grassland vegetation was restored rapidly during 2000-2006 and 2006-2011, reducing the total area of desertified grassland annually by 1.87 and 0.61%, respectively; finally, the area of severely desertified grassland decreased annually by 5.78 and 6.28% during 2000-2006 and 2006-2011, respectively. These results show that the region-wide grazing ban, together with other ecological engineering measures, has helped reverse desertification and promote the restoration of grassland vegetation.

AB The changing sizes of glaciers in the Cordillera Real (16.2 degrees S, 68.2 degrees W), Bolivian Andes, between 1987 and 2010 were determined by a band ratio method using cloud-free LANDSAT TM and ALOS AVNIR-2 data. From 1987 to 2010, glacier-covered areas in the Cordillera Real were found to have diminished by more than 30%. The rate of glacierized area shrinkage within this Andean region, and particularly of its glaciers, has significantly increased in the past 5 years. To characterize the change in glacierized area, a changing factor k was introduced to capture the effects of topographic factors, including elevation, slope angle, and aspect as identified using ASTER 30-m Global DEM data on the Huayna Potosi, Mururata, Charquini, Illimani, and Serkhe Khollu glaciers. This study also further analyzed the Huayna Potosi glacier and discussed the inhomogeneity of changes in its area with elevation, slope, aspect, and the distribution of solar radiation.

AB A simple approach for simulating forest albedo based on the spectral invariants theory was applied to produce the black-sky albedos of 644 boreal forest stands composed of Scots pine, Norway spruce and Silver birch. Results were compared to those simulated using a detailed forest radiative transfer model with input from an extensive forest inventory database. The model based on the spectral invariants produced similar ranges of albedo values for the stands of all species as the detailed model, indicating that despite its simplicity and limited input variables it is flexible enough when predicting the albedo of a forest.

AB Due to limited in-situ data global soil moisture products should also be validated with respect to independent global data sets. Our study investigates possibilities and benefits of relating soil moisture products from remote sensing and hydrological modeling to information on total water storage change from satellite gravimetry. We use soil moisture data from the active satellite sensor ASCAT and the hydrological model WGHM as well as satellite gravity field observations from the GRACE mission. First we apply a data harmonization procedure to equalize the distinct data representations and formats of those data sets. Then we perform a correlation analysis. The results show correlations close to one between GRACE and soil moisture data specifically for humid and temperate regions. A comparison of correlation coefficients from different data pairs highlights that in arid environments total water storage from GRACE corresponds better to surface soil moisture captured by ASCAT than to total soil moisture from WGHM. In humid and temperate regimes the observation is reversed. Furthermore regions could be identified where the input data of the WGHM might be of low quality, producing higher correlations between ASCAT and GRACE than between ASCAT and WGHM. We therefore conclude that GRACE data can deliver valuable information for the quality assessment of soil moisture products and provide a link to their contribution to continental water storage.

AB We computed the daily AVHRR snow cover from all available AVHRR level1b raw data over central Asia (CA) with an aggregated rating based snow identification scheme. The daily AVHRR snow cover was further processed into an 8-day maximum-snow-extent data, and then went through a set of spatial and temporal filters to fill cloud or gap pixels. A correction method based on known long term snow probability in small sub-regions has been developed for computing corrected 8-day AVHRR snow cover, which is comparable to 8-day MODIS snow data. Validation of the daily AVHRR snow product against ground snow survey suggested a high accuracy of the snow identification scheme. Comparison of the daily AVHRR snow cover with the daily MODIS snow cover in Amu Dar'ya River basin within CA showed high accuracy of daily AVHRR snow, with a general accuracy of 99.60% and Kappa Coefficient, of 0.92 in the basin. Comparison of the corrected 8-day AVHRR snow cover with 8-day MODIS cloud/gap free snow cover in the same basin also showed high comparability between both data, with a general accuracy of 95.61% and Kappa Coefficient of 0.84. Seasonal snow cover analysis in Amu Dar'ya River basin revealed the spatial and temporal patterns of snow distribution and negative trends in snow cover duration in 1986 to 2008 due to earlier snow melting dates. The newly developed long-term snow dataset from AVHRR and MODIS data over CA, with its high accuracy and internal comparability, is suitable for seasonal snow cover studies in mountainous regions over CA (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB The sub-glacial Plinian explosive eruption of the Grimsvotn volcano, which occurred on May 2011, is for the first time analyzed and quantitatively interpreted by using ground-based weather radar data and the Volcanic Ash Radar Retrieval (VARR) physically-based technique. The prevailing southerly winds stretched the erupted plume toward the Artic pole, thus preventing the ash cloud to move toward continental Europe and threatening the airline traffic (different from the less explosive Eyjafjoll eruption on April and May 2010). The 2011 Grimsvotn eruption has been continuously monitored by the Keflavik C-band weather radar, located at a distance of about 260 km from the volcano vent. The VARR methodology is summarized and applied to available radar time series to estimate the coarse ash particle category, volume, fallout, concentration and the plume maximum height, every 5 min within the volcano vent surroundings (i.e. an area of about 100 x 100 km(2) around the volcano). Due to the large distance from the volcano, fine-grained ash cannot be detected and estimated by the Keflavik C-band weather radar. Estimates of the eruption discharge rate, based on the retrieved ash plume top height, are provided together with an evaluation of the total erupted mass and volume. Deposited ash at ground is also retrieved from radar data by empirically reconstructing the vertical profile of radar reflectivity and estimating the near-surface ash fallout. Radar-based ash retrieval results can be compared with available satellite microwave radiometric imagery in order to show the potential contribution and limitations of these microwave remote sensing products to the understanding and modeling of explosive volcanic ash eruptions. Spaceborne microwave brightness temperatures show a correlation with ash columnar content, derived from VARR, depending on the millimeter-wave frequency and on the spatial averaging. Microphysical sensitivity of satellite microwave brightness temperatures to plume fine and coarse ash suggests their exploitation in synergy with satellite thermal infrared radiometer and ground-based microwave radar observations.

AB The area of land use or land cover change obtained directly from a map may differ greatly from the true area of change because of map classification error. An error-adjusted estimator of area can be easily produced once an accuracy assessment has been performed and an error matrix constructed. The estimator presented is a stratified estimator which is applicable to data acquired using popular sampling designs such as stratified random, simple random and systematic (the stratified estimator is often labeled a poststratified estimator for the latter two designs). A confidence interval for the area of land change should also be provided to quantify the uncertainty of the change area estimate. The uncertainty of the change area estimate, as expressed via the confidence interval, can then subsequently be incorporated into an uncertainty analysis for applications using land change area as an input (e.g., a carbon flux model). Accuracy assessments published for land change studies should report the information required to produce the stratified estimator of change area and to construct confidence intervals. However, an evaluation of land change articles published between 2005 and 2010 in two remote sensing journals revealed that accuracy assessments often fail to include this key information. We recommend that land change maps should be accompanied by an accuracy assessment that includes a clear description of the sampling design (including sample size and, if relevant, details of stratification), an error matrix, the area or proportion of area of each category according to the map, and descriptive accuracy measures such as user's, producer's and overall accuracy. Furthermore, mapped areas should be adjusted to eliminate bias attributable to map classification error and these error-adjusted area estimates should be accompanied by confidence intervals to quantify the sampling variability of the estimated area. Using data from the published literature, we illustrate how to produce error-adjusted point estimates and confidence intervals of land change areas. A simple analysis of uncertainty based on the confidence bounds for land change area is applied to a carbon flux model to illustrate numerically that variability in the land change area estimate can have a dramatic effect on model outputs.

AB The United Nations Collaborative Program on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN REDD) was launched with the aim of contributing to the development of capacity for reducing emissions from loss of forest carbon in developing countries. It is understood that REDD mechanisms must be supported by forest assessment programs that can monitor the carbon stocks by carbon pools and human activities. Reporting at a national level will be required but many countries are likely to benefit from more local monitoring programs within the countries as well, gauging the effects of national policies and local financial mechanisms aimed at reaching goals for emission control for the nation as a whole. Field-based forest sample surveys are typically used as support for national reporting purposes. However, monitoring within the countries will require huge investments in field surveys to provide reliable change estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution. Airborne scanning LiDAR has emerged as a promising tool to provide auxiliary data for sample surveys aiming at estimation of above-ground tree biomass. The aim of this study was to demonstrate how "wall-to-wall" LiDAR data can be used for change estimation. Estimators for areal changes of categories representing human activities such as "deforestation", "degradation" and "untouched" were presented. Corresponding estimators for variance were also provided. Furthermore, it was shown how net change in biomass for the defined activity categories and for the entire area of interest can be estimated from a field sample survey with and without support of LiDAR remote sensing data and how the uncertainty can be quantified by corresponding variance estimates. In a case study in a small boreal forest area in southeastern Norway (852.6 ha) a probability sample of 176 field sample plots distributed according to a stratified systematic design was measured twice over an 11 year period. Corresponding multi-temporal scanning LiDAR data were also available. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to predict change category for every LiDAR grid cell in the area, and areal changes were estimated from the pure field sample and with the support of the LiDAR data applying model-assisted estimators. The standard errors of the areal change estimates were reduced by 43-75% by adding LiDAR data to the estimation. The change categories were used as post-strata in a subsequent estimation of net change in biomass. The standard errors of the biomass change estimates for the respective change categories were reduced by 18-84% compared to the pure field survey when using LiDAR data as auxiliary information in a model-assisted estimation procedure, which translates to a need for 1.5-38.7 times as many field plots when relying only on the field data. For the entire area of interest, the standard error of the overall net change in biomass was reduced by 57% compared to the uncertainty reported from the pure field survey. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Clouds are the most important modulator of the amount of solar energy absorbed by the earth-atmosphere system. Traditional one-dimensional (1D) plane-parallel atmospheric radiative transfer models which use the independent pixel approximation (IPA) can only consider two extreme conditions, i.e., either cloud-free or overcast cases. In this paper, two cloud fraction related factors (hemispherical effective cloud fraction and regional cloud fraction) are calculated and incorporated into MODTRAN 4 (one of the most popular radiative transfer packages) to simulate the surface shortwave radiation components and the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance for all possible solar-cloud-viewing geometries. The accuracy of this modified solar radiative transfer model (named as MODTRAN-CF) is consistent with its prototype (MODTRAN 4) which has been widely used and validated in radiative transfer modeling. Some field measurements are used to validate the superiority of MODTRAN-CF. For further understanding and simplifying of this physical model, a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is employed to analyze the effect of model parameters on each surface shortwave radiation component. Five parameters including solar zenith angle, surface albedo, hemispherical effective cloud fraction, ground altitude and atmospheric visibility show non-negligible impacts on almost all surface shortwave fluxes, which indicates that these five parameters should be carefully considered in the future modeling of the surface shortwave radiation fluxes. Two cloud optical thickness related parameters (cloud extinction coefficient and cloud thickness) exhibit obvious importance only under cloudy illumination condition especially with optically thin clouds. These findings on the improved model will enhance our knowledge on how to accurately model the surface shortwave radiation fluxes under all sky conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Sand dune movements pose potential hazards against various land use activities in Egypt. To avoid or to minimize the hazards associated with sand dunes, it is critical to determine their rates and patterns of migration at high accuracy and over wide spatial coverage. This is, however, a real challenge using field work and traditional remote sensing approaches. The co-registration of optically sensed images and correlation (COSI-Corr) complements traditional approaches to provide accurate measurements at wide spatial coverage. Applying the COSI-Corr technique to two SPOT 4 panchromatic images acquired above North Sinai, we measured lateral migration of 6.0 to 19.4 m/yr with an average of 7.7 m/yr, and 9.3 to 15.0 m/yr with an average of 11.9 m/yr for the whole barchans dune areas and a selected sample of barchan dunes, respectively. We also detected that the lateral movements along the crest lines of linear dunes ranged from 4.0 to 20.1 m/yr with an average of 6.8 m/yr for the whole area occupied by linear dunes. For a selected linear dune within the study area, the lateral migration of peaks and saddles along the crest lines ranged from 5.5 to 16.7 m/yr with an average of 12.4 m/yr. The lateral migration of both barchans dunes and linear dunes showed high spatial variability. Validation of these results against the previously measured migration rates indicated high degree of accuracy of the technique. In addition, the displacement field produced from the correlation indicated that the direction of sand dune movements occurred towards the east and southeast, which is well aligned with the previously determined sand dune drifting potentials.

AB Spatially explicit and temporally continuous estimates of photosynthesis will be of great importance for increasing our understanding of and ultimately closing the terrestrial carbon cycle. Current capabilities to model photosynthesis, however, are limited by accurate enough representations of the complexity of the underlying biochemical processes and the numerous environmental constraints imposed upon plant primary production. A potentially powerful alternative to model photosynthesis through these indirect observations is the use of multi-angular satellite data to infer light-use efficiency (epsilon) directly from spectral reflectance properties in connection with canopy shadow fractions. Hall et al. (this issue) introduced a new approach for predicting gross ecosystem production that would allow the use of such observations in a data assimilation mode to obtain spatially explicit variations in epsilon from infrequent polar-orbiting satellite observations, while meteorological data are used to account for the more dynamic responses of epsilon to variations in environmental conditions caused by changes in weather and illumination. In this second part of the study we implement and validate the approach of Hall et al. (this issue) across an ecologically diverse array of eight flux-tower sites in North America using data acquired from the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (CHRIS) and eddy-flux observations. Our results show significantly enhanced estimates of epsilon and therefore cumulative gross ecosystem production (GEP) over the course of one year at all examined sites. We also demonstrate that epsilon is greatly heterogeneous even across small study areas. Data assimilation and direct inference of GEP from space using a new, proposed sensor could therefore be a significant step towards closing the terrestrial carbon cycle. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB This study evaluates the potential to use waveform data from bathymetric airborne lidar for mapping seabed substratum and vegetation using a site in the Northern Baltic Sea as a study area. One objective of the study was to develop classification procedures including accurate corrections of waveform data for environmental and lidar system factors, to make them useful for mapping areas with variable water quality. Other objectives were to evaluate the classification accuracy using a combination of depth-derived variables and additional waveform variables, and to compare the results with the classification accuracy obtained when classification is performed using depth-derived variables only (without additional waveform variables). The analysis was based on two waveform variables (bottom pulse width and pulse area), in addition to two depth-derived variables (slope and depth standard deviation). The classification was performed using a model-based maximum likelihood approach. The classification models were created and evaluated with lidar data taken from locations documented with underwater video. The results show that inclusion of the waveform variables significantly improved the classification accuracy. Classification of the seabed into three classes (hard substrate; soft substrate with high vegetation; and soft substrate with low vegetation) had an overall accuracy of 86% when evaluated with an independent data set. This highlights the potential of data from airborne lidar, including waveform data (bottom pulse width and pulse area), for mapping shallow seabed habitats in coastal areas. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The robust and accurate retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables using radiative transfer models (RTM) is seriously hampered by the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. With this research we further develop our previously published (object-based) inversion approach [Atzberger, 2004, RSE 93: 53-67] and evaluate it against simulated Sentinel-2 data. The proposed RTM inversion takes advantage of the geostatistical fact that the biophysical characteristics of nearby pixels are generally more similar than those at a larger distance. This leads to spectral co-variations in the n-dimensional spectral features space, which can be used for regularization purposes. A simple two-step inversion based on PROSPECT + SAIL generated look-up-tables is presented that can be easily adapted to other radiative transfer models. The approach takes into account the spectral signatures of adjacent pixels in gliding (3 x 3) windows. Using a set of leaf area index (LAI) measurements (n = 26) acquired over alfalfa, sugar beet and garlic crops of the Barrax test site (Spain), it is demonstrated that the proposed regularization using neighbourhood information yields more accurate results compared to the pixel-based inversion. With the proposed regularization, the RMSE between ground measured and Sentinel-2 derived LAI is 0.54 m(2)/m(2) and hence significantly lower compared to the RMSE of the standard inversion approach (RMSE: 1.46 m(2)/m(2)) and also of higher accuracy compared to a scaled NDVI model (RMSE: 0.90 m(2)/m(2)). At the same time, a positive effect on the modelled leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) is noticed, albeit too few field measurements were available for deriving statistically sound results. For the other retrieved biophysical parameters such as leaf dry matter content (C-m), soil brightness (alpha(soil)) and average leaf angle (ALA) the proposed algorithm yields more plausible and spatially consistent results. Altogether the findings confirm the positive effect of regularizing the model inversion using spatial constraints. As for any other inversion strategy, the approach requires a RTM well suited for the crop under study. For three additional crops (maize, potatoes and sunflower), the forward modelling with field measured LAI did not match the observed signatures. Consequently, for these canopies both the standard and the object-based inversion failed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates vegetation effects at L-band by using a first-order radiative transfer (RT) model and truck-based microwave measurements over natural conifer stands to assess the applicability of the tau - omega (tau-omega) model over trees. The tau-omega model is a zero-order RT solution that accounts for vegetation effects with two vegetation parameters (vegetation opacity and single-scattering albedo), which represent the canopy as a whole. This approach inherently ignores multiple-scattering effects and, therefore, has a limited validity depending on the level of scattering within the canopy. The fact that the scattering from large forest components such as branches and trunks is significant at L-band requires that zero-order vegetation parameters be evaluated (compared) along with their theoretical definitions to provide a better understanding of these parameters in the retrieval algorithms as applied to trees.
   This paper compares the effective vegetation opacities, computed from multi-angular pine tree brightness temperature data, against the results of two independent approaches that provide theoretical and measured optical depths. These two techniques are based on forward scattering theory and radar corner reflector measurements, respectively. The results indicate that the effective vegetation opacity values are smaller than but of similar magnitude to both radar and theoretical estimates. The effective opacity of the zero-order model is thus set equal to the theoretical opacity and an explicit expression for the effective albedo is then obtained from the zero- and first-order RT model comparison. The resultant albedo is found to have a similar magnitude as the effective albedo value obtained from brightness temperature measurements. However, both are less than half of the single-scattering albedo estimated using the theoretical calculations (0.5-0.6 for tree canopies at L-band). This lower observed effective albedo balances the scattering darkening effect of the large theoretical single-scattering albedo with a first-order multiple-scattering contribution. The retrieved effective albedo is different from theoretical definitions and not the albedo of single forest elements anymore, but it becomes a global parameter, which depends on all the processes taking place within the canopy, including multiple-scattering and canopy ground interaction.

AB One and a half years after the worst oil spill in U.S. history, we present the first quantitative assessment on the ecological impact of the spill on the salt marsh habitats along the southeastern Louisiana (LA) coast. This research combined satellite and ground data to quantify the impact of the oil and dispersant on the salt marshes in terms of their photosynthetic capacity and physiological status over a large spatial scale. Two of the most important marsh biophysical characteristics, including distribution of canopy chlorophyll content and above ground green biomass, were monitored across the southeastern LA coast during the salt marsh growing season (May-October) of 2009 (pre-spill) and 2010 (post-spill) in order to compare and isolate the spill impacted areas. The initial assessment showed that there was a significant post-spill increase in areas with reduced biomass and canopy chlorophyll (>400 km(2)) during the 2010 growing season compared to 50-65 km(2) during the 2009 growing season. Phenological analysis of the post oil-spill data revealed a significant decrease in the magnitude of biomass and canopy chlorophyll during the peak of the 2010 growing season. June was consistently found to be the worst month in terms of salt marsh health across LA over the 2010 phenological cycle followed by the initial signs of recovery along the fringing marsh areas proximal to the shoreline that were first impacted by oil. Interior marsh patches exhibited persistent signs of stress towards the end of the growing season. Extensive reduction in photosynthetic activity was observed during the peak of the growing season, particularly in Plaquemines Parish and St. Bernard Parish. The products generated through this study successfully delineate the critical hotspots of marsh stress so that prioritization of areas needing immediate restoration can be performed.

AB Coastal areas of the North Sea are commercially important for fishing and tourism, and are subject to the increasingly adverse effects of harmful algal blooms, eutrophication and climate change. Monitoring phytoplankton in these areas using Ocean Colour Remote Sensing is hampered by the high spatial and temporal variations in absorption and scattering properties. In this paper we demonstrate a clustering method based on specific-absorption properties that gives accurate water quality products from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). A total of 468 measurements of Chlorophyll a (Chla), Total Suspended Material (TSM), specific- (sIOP) and inherent optical properties (IOP) were measured in the North Sea between April 1999 and September 2004. Chla varied from 0.2 to 35 mg m(-3). TSM from 0.2 to 75 g m(-3) and absorption properties of coloured dissolved organic material at 442 nm (a(CDOM)(442)) was 0.02 to 0.26 m(-1). The variation in absorption properties of phytoplankton (a(ph)) and non-algal particles (a(NAP)) were an order of magnitude greater than that for a(ph) normalized to Chla (a(ph)*) and a(NAP) normalized to TSM (a(NAP)*). Hierarchical cluster analysis on a(ph)*, a(NAP). and a(CDOM) reduced this large data set to three groups of high a(NAP)*-a(CDOM). low a(ph)* situated close to the coast, medium values further offshore and low a(NAP)* a(CDOM), high a(ph)* in open ocean and Dutch coastal waters. The median sIOP of each cluster were used to parameterize a semi-analytical algorithm to retrieve concentrations of Chla, TSM and a(CDOM)(442) from MERIS data. A further 60 measurements of normalized water leaving radiance (nL(w)), Chla, TSM, a(CDOM)(442) and a(NAP)(442) collected between 2003 and 2006 were used to assess the accuracy of the satellite products. The regionalized MERIS algorithm showed improved performance in Chla and a(CDOM)(442) estimates with relative percentage differences of 29 and 8% compared to 34 and 134% for standard MERIS Chla and a(dg)(442) products, and similar retrieval for TSM at concentrations >1 g(-3).

Subsiding areas are distributed as either concentrated circular patterns corresponding to intense groundwater extraction (e.g., Rio Grande meander area; maximum deformation of 7-8 cm/yr) or as elongate patterns oriented along NE-SW or E-W directions and parallel to major faults (i.e. La Colina, La Paloma and Central Camionera; maximum deformation of 4-5 cm/yr). High subsidence rates are also measured on the hanging wall of major normal faults, where the thickest sequences of compressible Quaternary sediments crop out. Strong contrasts in subsidence rates are identified across major faults, suggesting that these faults act as barriers to horizontal movement of groundwater. Subsidence rates show a weak positive correlation with the total thickness of compressible deposits, while there is no correlation with either water extraction rates or changes in static water level. Time-lapse analysis of ground deformation with conventional InSAR reveals temporal variations of subsidence north of the La Canna fault and the Rio Grande meander area. For this latter area, cross sections and 3D perspectives of InSAR measures, and analysis of subsidence rates through time, show an acceleration of subsidence velocities since 2005, corresponding to recasing of the Prados Verdes II well, whose location is centered in the area of highest subsidence.

AB We present new radiative transfer simulations to support determination of sea surface temperature (SST) from Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) imagery. The simulations are to be used within the ATSR Reprocessing for Climate project. The simulations are based on the "Reference Forward Model" line-by-line model linked with a sea surface emissivity model that accounts for wind speed and temperature, and with a discrete ordinates scattering model (DISORT). Input to the forward model is a revised atmospheric profile dataset, based on full resolution ERA-40, with a wider range of high-latitude profiles to address known retrieval biases in those regions. Analysis of the radiative impacts of atmospheric trace gases shows that geographical and temporal variation of N2O, CH4, HNO3. and CFC-11 and CFC-12 have effects of order 0.05, 0.2, 0.1 K on the 3.7, 11, 12 mu m channels respectively. In addition several trace gases, neglected in previous studies, are included using fixed profiles contributing similar to 0.04 K to top-of-atmosphere BTs. Comparison against observations for ATSR2 and AATSR indicates that forward model biases have been reduced from 0.2 to 0.5 K for previous simulations to similar to 0.1 K. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB A new aerosol index for the Along-Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSRs) is presented that provides a means to detect desert dust contamination in infrared SST retrievals. The ATSR Saharan dust index (ASDI) utilises only the thermal infrared channels and may therefore be applied consistently to the entire ATSR data record (1991 to present), for both day time and night time observations. The derivation of the ASDI is based on a principal component (PC) analysis (PCA) of two unique pairs of channel brightness temperature differences (BTDS). In 2-D space (i.e. BTD vs BTD), it is found that the loci of data unaffected by aerosol are confined to a single axis of variability. In contrast, the loci of aerosol-contaminated data fall off-axis, shifting in a direction that is approximately orthogonal to the clear-sky axis. The ASDI is therefore defined to be the second PC, where the first PC accounts for the clear-sky variability. The primary ASDI utilises the ATSR nadir and forward-view observations at 11 and 12 mu m (ASDI2). A secondary, three-channel nadir-only ASDI (ASDI3) is also defined for situations where data from the forward view are not available. Empirical and theoretical analyses suggest that ASDI is well correlated with aerosol optical depth (AOD: correlation r is typically >0.7) and provides an effective tool for detecting desert mineral dust Overall. ASDI2 is found to be more effective than ASDI3, with the latter being sensitive only to very high dust loading. In addition, use of ASDI3 is confined to night time observations as it relies on data from the 3.7 mu m channel, which is sensitive to reflected solar radiation. This highlights the benefits of having data from both a nadir- and a forward-view for this particular approach to aerosol detection. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In response to the urgent need for improved mapping of global biomass and the lack of any current space systems capable of addressing this need, the BIOMASS mission was proposed to the European Space Agency for the third cycle of Earth Explorer Core missions and was selected for Feasibility Study (Phase A) in March 2009. The objectives of the mission are 1) to quantify the magnitude and distribution of forest biomass globally to improve resource assessment, carbon accounting and carbon models, and 2) to monitor and quantify changes in terrestrial forest biomass globally, on an annual basis or better, leading to improved estimates of terrestrial carbon sources (primarily from deforestation); and terrestrial carbon sinks due to forest regrowth and afforestation. These science objectives require the mission to measure above-ground forest biomass from 70 degrees N to 56 degrees Sat spatial scale of 100-200 m, with error not exceeding +/- 20% or +/- 10 t ha(-1) and forest height with error of +/- 4 m. To meet the measurement requirements, the mission will carry a P-Band polarimetric SAR (centre frequency 435 MHz with 6 MHz bandwidth) with interferometric capability, operating in a dawn-dusk orbit with a constant incidence angle (in the range of 25 degrees-35 degrees) and a 25-45 day repeat cycle. During its 5-year lifetime, the mission will be capable of providing both direct measurements of biomass derived from intensity data and measurements of forest height derived from polarimetric interferometry. The design of the BIOMASS mission spins together two main observational strands: (1) the long heritage of airborne observations in tropical, temperate and boreal forest that have demonstrated the capabilities of P-band SAR for measuring forest biomass; (2) new developments in recovery of forest structure including forest height from Pol-InSAR, and, crucially, the resistance of P-band to temporal decorrelation, which makes this frequency uniquely suitable for biomass measurements with a single repeat-pass satellite. These two complementary measurement approaches are combined in the single BIOMASS sensor, and have the satisfying property that increasing biomass reduces the sensitivity of the former approach while increasing the sensitivity of the latter. This paper surveys the body of evidence built up over the last decade, from a wide range of airborne experiments, which illustrates the ability of such a sensor to provide the required measurements.
   At present, the BIOMASS P-band radar appears to be the only sensor capable of providing the necessary global knowledge about the world's forest biomass and its changes. In addition, this first chance to explore the Earth's environment with a long wavelength satellite SAR is expected to make yield new information in a range of geoscience areas, including subsurface structure in arid lands and polar ice, and forest inundation dynamics.

AB Conservation of biodiversity requires information at many spatial scales in order to detect and preserve habitat for many species, often simultaneously. Vegetation structure information is particularly important for avian habitat models and has largely been unavailable for large areas at the desired resolution. Airborne LiDAR, with its combination of relatively broad coverage and fine resolution provides existing new opportunities to map vegetation structure and hence avian habitat. Our goal was to model the richness of forest songbirds using forest structure information obtained from LiDAR data. In deciduous forests of southern Wisconsin, USA, we used discrete-return airborne LiDAR to derive forest structure metrics related to the height and density of vegetation returns, as well as composite variables that captured major forest structural elements. We conducted point counts to determine total forest songbird richness and the richness of foraging, nesting, and forest edge-related habitat guilds. A suite of 35 LiDAR variables were used to model bird species richness using best-subsets regression and we used hierarchical partitioning analysis to quantify the explanatory power of each variable in the multivariate models. Songbird species richness was correlated most strongly with LiDAR variables related to canopy and midstory height and midstory density (R-2=0.204, p<0.001). Richness of species that nest in the midstory was best explained by canopy height variables (R-2=0.197, p<0.001). Species that forage on the ground responded to mean canopy height and the height of the lower canopy (R-2=0.149, p<0.005) while aerial foragers had higher richness where the canopy was tall and dense and the midstory more sparse (R-2=0.216. p<0.001). Richness of edge-preferring species was greater where there were fewer vegetation returns but higher density in the understory (R-2=0.153, p<0.005). Forest interior specialists responded positively to a tall canopy, developed midstory, and a higher proportion of vegetation returns (R-2=0.195, p<0.001). LiDAR forest structure metrics explained between 15 and 20% of the variability in richness within deciduous forest songbird communities. This variability was associated with vertical structure alone and shows how LiDAR can provide a source of complementary predictive data that can be incorporated in models of wildlife habitat associations across broad geographical extents.

AB In this study, a combination of low and high density airborne LiDAR and satellite SPOT-5 HRG data were used in conjunction with ground measurements of forest structure to parameterize four models for zero-plane displacement height d(m) and aerodynamic roughness length z(0m)(m), over cool-temperate forests in Heihe River basin, an arid region of Northwest China. For the whole study area, forest structural parameters including tree height (Ht) (m), first branch height (FBH) (m), crown width (ON) (m) and stand density (SD) (trees ha(-1)) were derived by stepwise multiple linear regressions of ground-based forest measurements and height quantiles and fractional canopy cover (f(c)) derived from the low density LiDAR data. The high density LiDAR data, which covered a much smaller area than the low density LiDAR data, were used to relate SPOT-5's reflectance to the effective plant area index (PAIe) of the forest. This was done by linear spectrum decomposition and Li-Strahler geometric-optical models. The result of the SPOT-5 spectrum decomposition was applied to the whole area to calculate PAIe (and leaf area index LAI). Then, four roughness models were applied to the study area with these vegetation data derived from the LiDAR and SPOT-5 as input. For validation, measurements at an eddy covariance site in the study area were used. Finally, the four models were compared by plotting histograms of the accumulative distribution of modeled d and z(0m) in the study area. The results showed that the model using by frontal area index (FAI) produced best d estimate, and the model using both LAI and FM generated the best z(0m). Furthermore, all models performed much better when the representative tree height was Lorey's mean height instead of using an arithmetic mean. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite remote sensing has the potential to contribute to plant phenology monitoring at spatial and temporal scales relevant for regional and global scale studies. Historically, temporal composites of satellite data, ranging from 8 days to 16 days, have been used as a starting point for satellite-derived phenology data sets. In this study we assess how the temporal resolution of such composites affects the estimation of the start of season (SOS) by: 1) calibrating a relationship between satellite derived SOS with in situ leaf unfolding (LU) of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) across Canada and 2) quantifying the sensitivity of calibrated satellite SOS estimates and trends, over Canadian broadleaf forests, to the temporal resolution of NDVI data. SOS estimates and trends derived from daily NDVI data were compared to SOS estimates and trends derived from multiday NDVI composites that retain the exact date of the maximum NDVI value or that assume the midpoint of the multiday interval as the observation date. In situ observations of LU dates were acquired from the PlantWatch Canada network. A new Canadian database of cloud and snow screened daily 1-km resolution National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advanced very high resolution radiometer surface reflectance images was used as input satellite data. The mean absolute errors of SOS dates with respect to in situ LU dates ranged between 13 and 40 days. SOS estimates from NDVI composites that retain the exact date of the maximum NDVI value had smaller errors (similar to 13 to 20 days). The sensitivity analysis reinforced these findings: SOS estimates from NDVI composites that use the exact date had smaller absolute deviations from the LU date (0 to 5 days) than the SOS estimates from NDVI composites that use the midpoint (-2 to -27 days). The SOS trends between 1985 and 2007 were not sensitive to the temporal resolution or compositing methods. However, SOS trends at individual ecozones showed significant differences with the SOS trends from daily NDVI data (Taiga plains and the Pacific maritime zones). Overall, our results suggest that satellite based estimates of vegetation green-up dates should preferably use sub-sampled NDVI composites that include the exact observation date of the maximum NDVI to minimize errors in both. SOS estimates and SOS trend analyses. For trend analyses alone, any of the compositing methods could be used, preferably with composite intervals of less than 28 days. This is an important finding, as it suggests that existing long-term 10-day or 15-day NDVI composites could be used for SOS trend analyses over broadleaf forests in Canada or similar areas. Future studies will take advantage of the growing in situ phenology networks to improve the validation of satellite derived green-up dates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A desirable feature of a global sampling design for estimating forest cover change based on satellite imagery is the ability to adapt the design to obtain precise regional estimates, where a region may be a country, state, province, or conservation area. A sampling design stratified by an auxiliary variable correlated with forest cover change has this adaptability. A global stratified random sample can be augmented by additional sample units within a region selected by the same stratified protocol and the resulting sample constitutes a stratified random sample of the region. Stratified sampling allows increasing the sample size in a region by a few to many additional sample units. The additional sample units can be effectively allocated to strata to reduce the standard errors of the regional estimates, even though these strata were not initially constructed for the objective of regional estimation. A complete coverage map of deforestation within the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) is used as a population to evaluate precision of regional estimates obtained by augmenting a global stratified random sample. The standard errors of the regional estimates for the BLA and states within the BLA obtained from the augmented stratified design were generally smaller than those attained by simple random sampling and systematic sampling.

AB Remote sensing provides spatially and temporally continuous measures of forest reflectance, and vegetation indices calculated from satellite data can be useful for monitoring climate change impacts on forest tree phenology. Monitoring of evergreen coniferous forest is more difficult than monitoring of deciduous forest, as the new buds only account for a small proportion of the green biomass, and the shoot elongation process is relatively slow. In this study, we have analyzed data from 186 coniferous monitoring sites in Sweden covering boreal, southern-boreal, and boreo-nemoral conditions. Our objective was to examine the possibility to track seasonal changes in coniferous forests by time-series of MODIS eight-day vegetation indices, testing the coherence between satellite monitored vegetation indices (VI) and temperature dependent phenology. The relationships between two vegetation indices (NDVI and WDRVI) and four phenological indicators (length of snow season, modeled onset of vegetation period, tree cold hardiness level and timing of budburst) were analyzed.
   The annual curves produced by two curve fitting methods for smoothening of seasonal changes in NDVI and WDRVI were to a large extent characterized by the occurrence of snow, producing stable seasonal oscillations in the northern part and irregular curves with less pronounced annual amplitude in the southern part of the country. Measures based on threshold values of the VI-curves, commonly used for determining the timing of different phenological phases, were not applicable for Swedish coniferous forests. Evergreen vegetation does not have a sharp increase in greenness during spring, and the melting of snow can influence the vegetation indices at the timing of bud burst in boreal forests. However, the interannual variation in VI-values for specific eight-day periods was correlated with the phenological indicators. This relation can be used for satellite monitoring of potential climate change impacts on northern coniferous spring phenology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The temporal frequency of the thermal data provided by current spaceborne high-resolution imagery systems is inadequate for agricultural applications. As an alternative to the lack of high-resolution observations, kilometric thermal data can be disaggregated using a green (photosynthetically active) vegetation index e.g. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) collected at high resolution. Nevertheless, this approach is only valid in the conditions where vegetation temperature is approximately uniform. To extend the validity domain of the classical approach, a new methodology is developed by representing the temperature difference between photosynthetically and non-photosynthetically active vegetation. In practice, both photosynthetically and non-photosynthetically active vegetation fractions are derived from a time series of Formosat-2 shortwave data, and then included in the disaggregation procedure. The approach is tested over a 16 km by 10 km irrigated cropping area in Mexico during a whole agricultural season. Kilometric MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) surface temperature is disaggregated at 100 m resolution, and disaggregated temperature is subsequently compared against concurrent ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data. Statistical results indicate that the new methodology is more robust than the classical one, and is always more accurate when fractional non-photosynthetically active vegetation cover is larger than 0.10. The mean correlation coefficient and slope between disaggregated and ASTER temperature is increased from 0.75 to 0.81 and from 0.60 to 0.77, respectively. The approach is also tested using the MODIS data re-sampled at 2 km resolution. Aggregation reduces errors in MODIS data and consequently increases the disaggregation accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Mean stand height is an important parameter for forest volume and biomass estimation in support of monitoring and management activities. Information on mean stand height is typically obtained through the manual interpretation of aerial photography, often supplemented by the collection of field calibration data. In remote areas where forest management practices may not be spatially exhaustive or where it is difficult to acquire aerial photography, alternate approaches for estimating stand height are required. One approach is to use very high spatial resolution (VHSR) satellite imagery (pixels sided less than 1 m) as a surrogate for air photos. In this research we demonstrate an approach for modelling mean stand height at four sites in the Yukon Territory, Canada, from Quick Bird panchromatic imagery. An object-based approach was used to generate homogenous segments from the imagery (analogous to manually delineated forest stands) and an algorithm was used to automatically delineate individual tree crowns within the segments. A regression tree was used to predict mean stand height from stand-level metrics generated from the image grey-levels and within-stand objects relating individual tree crown characteristics. Heights were manually interpreted from the Quick Bird imagery and divided into separate sets of calibration and validation data. The effects of calibration data set size and the input metrics used on the regression tree results were also assessed. The approach resulted in a model with a significant R-2 of 0.53 and an RMSE of 2.84 m. In addition, 84.6% of the stand height estimates were within the acceptable error for photo interpreted heights, as specified by the forest inventory standards of British Columbia. Furthermore, residual errors from the model were smallest for the stands that had larger mean heights (i.e., >20 m), which aids in reducing error in subsequent estimates of biomass or volume (since stands with larger trees contribute more to overall estimates of volume or biomass). Estimated and manually interpreted heights were reclassified into 5-metre height classes (a schema frequently used for forest analysis and modelling applications) and compared; classes corresponded in 54% of stands assessed, and all stands had an estimated height class that was within +/- 1 class of their actual class. This study demonstrates the capacity of VHSR panchromatic imagery (in this case QuickBird) for generating useful estimates of mean stand heights in unmonitored, remote, or inaccessible forest areas.

AB The ground data used as a reference in the validation of land cover change products are often not an ideal gold standard but degraded by error. The effects of ground reference data error on the accuracy of land cover change detection and the accuracy of estimates of the extent of change were evaluated. Twelve data sets were simulated to allow the exploration of the impacts of a spectrum of ground data imperfections on the estimation of the producer's and user's accuracy of change as well as of change extent Simulated data were used since this ensured that the actual properties of the data were known and to exclude effects due to other sources of ground reference data error; although the impacts of simulated reference data error on two real confusion matrices are also illustrated. The imperfections evaluated ranged from the inclusion of small amounts of known error into the ground reference data through to the extreme situation in which ground data were absent. The results show that even small amounts of error in the ground reference data can introduce large error into studies of land cover change by remote sensing and reinforce the desire to avoid the expression ground truth as this might imply that the data are a gold standard reference. The effect of reference data imperfections was dependent on the degree of association between the errors in the cross-tabulated data sets. For example, in the scenarios investigated, a 10% error in the reference data set introduced an underestimation of the producer's accuracy of 18.5% if the errors were independent but an over-estimation of the producer's accuracy of 12.3% if the errors were correlated. The magnitude of the misestimation of the producer's accuracy was also a function of the amount of change and greatest at low levels of change. The amount of land cover change estimated also varied greatly as a function of ground reference data error. Some possible methods to reduce or even remove the impacts of ground reference data error were illustrated. These ranged from simple algebraic means to estimate the actual values of accuracy and change extent if the imperfections were known through to a latent class analysis that allowed the assessment of classification accuracy and estimation of change extent without the use of ground reference data if the underlying model is defined appropriately.

AB Atmospheric mineral dust is an important component of the climate system; however, representation of dust production in the climate models poses significant challenges. Satellite remote sensing has the potential to aid in determining the surface characteristics of active dust source regions that are of importance to dust emission modeling. This study uses data from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in conjunction with soil texture to investigate linkages of spatial distribution of surface characteristics related to dust emission, and their dynamics, at the seasonal time scale. In addition to standard MODIS land products such as surface albedo and NDVI which are strongly linked to dust emission, we introduce a roughness index (RI) and an arid soil surface index (ASSI) to aid in land surface characterization. Three regions of northwestern China known for dust emission, the Taklamakan, Badain Jaran, and Gurbantunggut Deserts, are examined for spatial and temporal changes of surface characteristics during winter-spring-summer transition February-July 2005. A new methodology is proposed by introducing regional masking derived from MODIS Band 10 surface albedo. The analysis demonstrates regional unique temporal and spatial characteristics in the 2005 seasonal transition for these areas. Seasonal modes of response are clearly present. The soil texture correlation results demonstrate that clay fraction has a consistently high negative correlation to albedo, as does vegetation. The analysis also demonstrates that RI is a dynamic characteristic changing both with season and on much shorter time scales. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB To reduce environment pollution from cropping activities, a reliable indicator of crop N status is needed for site-specific N management in agricultural fields Nitrogen Nutrition Index (NNI) can be a valuable candidate, but its measurement relies on tedious sampling and laboratory analysis This study proposes a new spectral index to estimate plant nitrogen (N) concentration, which is a critical component of NNI calculation. Hyperspectral reflectance data, covering bands from 325 to 1075 nm, were collected using a ground-based spectroradiometer on corn and wheat crops at different growth stages from 2005 to 2008 Data from 2006 to 2008 was used for new index development and the comparison of the new index with some existing indices. Data from 2005 was used to validate the best index for predicting plant N concentration. Additionally, a hyperspectral image of corn field in 2005 was acquired using an airborne Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). and the corresponding plant N concentration was obtained by conventional laboratory methods on selected area. These data were also used for validation. A new N index, named Double-peak Canopy Nitrogen Index (DCNI), was developed and compared to the existing indices that were used for N detection In this study, DCNI was the best spectral index for predicting plant N concentration, with R-2 values of 072 for corn, 044 for wheat, and 0.64 for both species combined, respectively. The validation using an independent ground-based spectral database of corn acquired in 2005, yielded an R-2 value of 062 and a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.7 mg N g(-1) d m The validation using the CASI spectral information, DCNI calculation was related to actual corn N concentration with a R-2 value of 051 and a RMSE value of 3 1 mg N g(-1) d m. It is concluded that DCNI. in association with indices related to biomass, has a good potential for remote assessment of NNI Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of identifying overlapping clouds that contain thin cirrus overlying a lower-level water cloud by synergetic use of POLDER-3 (Polarization and Directionality of the Earth Reflectance) and MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data. When thin cirrus clouds overlap the liquid cloud layer, the liquid information may be obtained by POLDER observations and the presence of the cirrus may be Inferred from the MODIS CO(2)-slicing technique. An initial comparison of the POLDER cloud phase and the MODIS cloud-top pressure for one scene over East Asia also shows that a large portion of clouds declared as liquid water clouds by POLDER-3 correspond to the lower cloud-top pressures derived from MODIS As a result, an overlapped cloud identification method is proposed under the assumption that the multilayered cloud would be present if the POLDER cloud phase is liquid water and the MODIS cloud-top pressure is less than 500 hPa. For the studied scene, the comparison of the multilayered cloud identification results with CloudSat and CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) observations illustrates that the proposed method could detect multilayered clouds when the upper cirrus has a visible optical thickness of less than 2 0 Then the identification results are compared with the MODIS Cloud_Multi_Layer_Flag. It is indicated that the consistency between the multilayered clouds from the proposed synergy and MODIS-operational algorithm increases gradually from over 40% to nearly 100% with the increase of the confidence level of the MODIS multilayered clouds from the lowest to the highest Further analysis suggests that the majority of multilayered clouds falsely classified as single-layered clouds by the proposed method may correspond to relatively thick cirrus covering lower-level water clouds. Additionally, an Index by using the multilayered cloud detection differences from the two methods is proposed to provide some information on the optical thickness of the cirrus covering lower-level water cloud Finally, quantitative comparisons are extended to four other scenes at different locations by using active measurements. The results also show that the mean visible optical thickness of the high-level clouds of the multilayered clouds detected by both methods (1 57) is remarkably less than that by only MODIS-operational method (2.84), which means that the differences between the results from the two methods are mainly caused by the different sensitivities to the visible optical thickness of the high-level cloud and could be used to indicate the range of the visible optical thickness of the cirrus clouds covering the lower-level water clouds.

AB Leaf Area Index (LAI) is one of the most important variables characterizing land surface vegetation and dynamics. Many satellite data, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), have been used to generate LAI products. It is important to characterize their spatial and temporal variations by developing mathematical models from these products. In this study, we aim to model MODIS LAI time series and further predict its future values by decomposing the LAI time series of each pixel into several components: trend, intra-annual variations, seasonal cycle, and stochastic stationary or irregular parts. Three such models that can characterize the non-stationary time series data and predict the future values are explored, including Dynamic Harmonics Regression (DHR), STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on Loess), and Seasonal ARIMA (AutoRegressive Intergrated Moving Average) (SARIMA). The preliminary results using six years (2001-2006) of the MODIS LAI product indicate that all these methods are effective to model LAI time series and predict 2007 LAI values reasonably well. The SARIMA model gives the best prediction, DHR produces the smoothest curve, and STL is more sensitive to noise in the data. These methods work best for land cover types with pronounced seasonal variations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Debris cover on glacier boundaries critically impedes the global inventorying of glaciers and confounds most of the techniques developed for semi-automated mapping of glaciers. Debris on the glacier (referred as supraglacial debris) and that occurring outside the glacier boundaries (referred as periglacial debris) being derived from a common source, i.e. the valley rock, tend to have a similar spectral response in the reflection region which renders them mutually indistinguishable. However, there exist temperature differences between them. This aspect has been considered in this remote sensing based study to distinguish between the supraglacial and periglacial debris in a test area in the Chenab basin, Himalayas, by inclusion of thermal infrared (TIR) bands in remote sensing data processing. A synergistic multisensor approach for the delineation of debris-covered glacier boundaries is used here which integrates the inputs from thermal (TERRA-ASTER sensor) and optical (IRS-P6-AWiFS sensor) remote sensing data, multispectral classification techniques and the DEM derived geomorphometric parameters. The results of this study corroborate earlier findings on utilization of temperature differences as one of the parameters in glacial studies. The proposed synergistic approach therefore appears useful in accurate mapping of debris-covered glaciers in the Himalayan region. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Monitoring the growth and distribution of Arctic tundra vegetation is important for understanding changes in early growing season conditions in Arctic ecosystems in response to a warming climate. The primary objective of this study is to examine the utility of computed Daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products relative to 16-day maximum value composite (MVC) datasets for observing early season green-up dynamics of Arctic tundra vegetation across the North Slope of Alaska. Greening in the Arctic typically occurs shortly after snowmelt and can potentially be captured by using satellite observations that are available on a daily basis. Daily MODIS Snow Cover products were employed to retrieve dates of complete snowmelt (DOCS) for 2003-2005 for pixels that were cloud free at the time of complete snowmelt. Given the sparseness of cloud-free observations in both space and time, early season NDVI trajectories for cloud-free pixels were derived using daily MODIS data based on two approaches: a chronosequence (temporally continuous but aspatial) and a pixel trajectory (temporally discontinuous but spatial explicit) approach.
   On average during the three-year period, 12.5% of the North Slope region was cloud free at the time of complete snowmelt and a majority of these cloud-free pixels (65%) were associated with the Coastal Plain province. In contrast, the Foothills region was relatively less cloudy from the time following complete snowmelt until peak greenness (56%) than the Coastal Plain province (61%). As a result, vegetation communities that lie mostly in the Foothills province such as shrub tundra and moist acidic tundra classes had more cloud-free observations available to characterize NDVI trajectories using the pixel trajectory approach. Complete snowmelt in the North Slope generally occurred between day of year (DOY) 140 and 170 over the three years with areas covered by the shrub tundra vegetation community (Foothills province) experiencing snowmelt first in all three years with mean DOCS ranging from DOY 148 in 2004 to DOY 158 in 2003. For approximately two weeks following complete snowmelt (Phase I, a period of rapid NDVI increase), the Daily NDVI derived trajectories were substantially different from the MVC NDVI trajectories. Early season integrated NDVI (ESINDVI) values computed for Phase I were 7% higher using the Daily NDVI approaches relative to those derived from the MVC MODIS data for the North Slope region. Following this initial period, until peak greenness (Phase 2, a period of gradual NDVI increase), the Daily and MVC trajectories were similar in shape and magnitude. This study demonstrates the utility of the Daily MODIS Snow product for assessing cloud cover and snowmelt patterns and Daily MODIS NDVI data for observing and detecting sharp and rapid changes in early season vegetation phenology as seen during Phase I.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is a commonly required parameter when modelling land surface fluxes. Satellite based imagers, such as the 300 m full resolution (FR) Medium Spectral Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), offer the potential for timely LAI mapping. The availability of multiple IMERIS LAI algorithms prompts the need for an evaluation of their performance, especially over a range of land use conditions. Four current methods for deriving LAI from MERIS FR data were compared to estimates from in-situ measurements over a 3 km x 3 km region near Ottawa, Canada. The LAI of deciduous dominant forest stands and corn, soybean and pasture fields was measured in-situ using digital hemispherical photography and processed using the CANEYE software. MERIS LAI estimates were derived using the MERIS Top of Atmosphere (TOA) algorithm, MERIS Top of Canopy (TOC) algorithm, the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) Empirical algorithm and the University of Toronto (UofT) GLOBCARBON algorithm. Results show that TOA and TOC LAI estimates were nearly identical (R(2)>0.98) with underestimation of LAI when it is larger than 4 and overestimation when smaller than 2 over the study region. The UofT and CCRS LAI estimates had root mean square errors over 1.4 units with large (similar to 25%) relative residuals over forests and consistent underestimates over corn fields. Both algorithms were correlated (R(2)>0.8) possibly due to their use of the same spectral bands derived vegetation index for retrieving LAI. LAI time series from TOA, TOC and CCRS algorithms showed smooth growth trajectories however similar errors were found when the values were compared with the in-situ LAI. In summary, none of the IMERIS LAI algorithms currently meet performance requirements from the Global Climate Observing System. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI Influence of forest cover fraction on L-band soil moisture retrievals

AB Airborne L-band data from the Australian National Airborne Field Experiment 2005 (NAFE '05) field campaign were used to investigate the influence of fractional forest cover on soil moisture retrievals from heterogeneous (grass/forest) pixels. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to use experimental data on this subject and was done in view of the SMOS mission, in order to contribute to calibration/validation studies and the analysis of heterogeneous surfaces. Because the multi-angle observations were contained in swaths, swaths were used instead of pixels as the basic surface unit in this study. Simultaneous retrievals of soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (tau(NAD)) were undertaken by inversion of the L-MEB zero-order radiative transfer model. This was done for two different retrieval configurations, the first consisting of swath-effective values of SM and tau(NAD) and the second consisting of values of SM and tau(NAD) for the non-forested (i.e. grass) fraction of the swath, with forest emission known from forward modelling. Model inputs for non-retrieved parameters were either default values taken from the literature or site- and time-specific values obtained from observations of nearby homogeneous swaths gathered during the same flight. The main focus of this study was on retrieval behaviour for various soil moisture conditions and forest fractions. Area-averaged retrieval results were generally very reasonable for both retrieval configurations. When retrieving swath-effective values of SM and tau(NAD), tau(NAD) showed an increased overestimation with increased forest fraction. Highest retrieved values of SM were found at intermediate values of forest fraction. The results show the difficulty in flagging upper limits of pixel forest fraction during soil moisture retrievals, besides the fact that erroneous parameter values can lead to high errors in retrieved SM, especially in wet conditions. This study is the first to give a realistic idea of the errors and uncertainties involved in soil moisture retrievals from partly forested swaths, and as such will contribute to a better understanding of SMOS calibration/validation issues.

AB A spectral matching algorithm (SMA) that allows atmospheric correction in the presence of dust aerosols is applied to SeaWiFS imagery in the northwest Mediterranean Sea. The goal is to find criteria that could be used to identify SMA target pixels and to gain insights into the method's accuracy relative to the standard SeaWiFS processing scheme (STD). This work also represents the first validation of SMA using in situ data. The validation dataset includes water-leaving radiances collected from both a fixed buoy site and from a ship during the Advanced Optical Properties Experiment (AOPEX) cruise in August 2004. Supplementary information was provided by the ship LIDAR and coastal AERONET stations in Villefranche (France) and Blida (Algeria) that recorded aerosol conditions near the buoy and proximal to the dust sources. respectively. Backward aerosol transport trajectories were also available for the AERONET sites. allowing identification of potential dust sources, especially for aerosol layers observed by the LIDAR. Over the study period, four aerosol events affected the buoy vicinity, but SMA retrievals proved superior to standard processing results only when dust was dominant, rather than when dust was simply present. The conditions appropriate for an SMA application could be defined using AERONET parameters. They are a combination of high aerosol optical depth tau(a) and low Angstrom exponent alpha (or tau(a)/alpha>0.2). Similar results are obtained using the equivalent SeaWiFS parameters produced by the M method although the threshold value is different Since it is preferable to apply the criterion on a per-pixel basis prior to atmospheric correction to select SMA or STD processing, an analogous test using aerosol model-independent quantities derived from SeaWiFS data is proposed. Thus, SMA and STD processing can be applied to a single image, where appropriate. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We developed a novel method to quantify subtle rates of landscape evolution using two satellite imaging systems with different viewing angles and spectral sensitivities. We selected the slowly migrating, high-latitude, subarctic Great Kobuk Sand Dunes (GKSD), Kobuk Valley National Park, Alaska (USA), for our study. The COSI-Corr technique was used for precise orthorectification, co-registration, and subpixel correlation of satellite data. ASTER Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) and SPOT Panchromatic images with a 5-year temporal separation were correlated to measure the horizontal velocity of the GKSD. To reduce correlation noise, ASTER VNIR bands were linearly mixed to match the SPOT Panchromatic band, and raw correlation measurements were projected onto a local robust migration direction to estimate unbiased velocity magnitudes. The results show that the most likely migration rate for the GKSD ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 m/year. with peak velocities up to 3.8 m/year, and uncertainty of approximately 0.16 m/year. The unprecedented ability to measure slow migration rates, including those that may occur over a relatively short time interval, illustrates the value of this method to reliably detect and monitor subtle ground movements including dune migration, glacier flow, mass movements, and other small-scale processes.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing is the definitive optical tool for increasing knowledge and understanding of the Earth's surface. Contiguous high-resolution spectrometry provides a new dimension in mapping capability because of the potential for quantitative measurement of surface biogeochemistry. Alexander Goetz provided the vision and leadership that has produced nearly all critical developments in this field. He was among the first to recognize that spectrometry would change optical remote sensing from qualitative observations to quantitative physical measurements. His significant accomplishments over the last 25 years include development of critical image processing and atmospheric correction software, spectrometers that made it possible to move research out of the lab and into the field environment, and the development of NASA's airborne imaging spectrometer program. This special issue is dedicated to Dr. Goetz and his accomplishments. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity are key parameters in estimating the land surface radiation budget, a major controlling factor of global climate and environmental change. In this study, Terra Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Aqua MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 5 LST and emissivity products are evaluated using long-term ground-based longwave radiation observations collected at six Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites from 2000 to 2007. LSTs at a spatial resolution of 90 m from 197 ASTER images during 2000-2007 are directly compared to ground observations at the six SURFRAD sites. For nighttime data. ASTER LST has an average bias of 0.1 degrees C and the average bias is 0.3 degrees C during daytime. Aqua MODIS LST at 7 km resolution during nighttime retrieved from a split-window algorithm is evaluated from 2002 to 2007. MODIS LST has an average bias of -0.2 degrees C. LST heterogeneity (defined as the Standard Deviation, STD, of ASTER LSTs in 1 x 1 km(2) region, 11 x 11 pixel in total) and instrument calibration error of pyrgeometer are key factors impacting the ASTER and MODIS LST evaluation using ground-based radiation measurements. The heterogeneity of nighttime ASTER LST is 1.2 degrees C, which accounts for 71% of the STD of the comparison, while the heterogeneity of the daytime LST is 2.4 degrees C, which accounts for 60% of the STD. Collection 5 broadband emissivity is 0.01 larger than that of MODIS Collection 4 products and ASTER emissivity. It is essential to filter out the abnormal low values of ASTER daily emissivity data in summer time before its application. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB COSMOS (Campaign for validating the Operation of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity), and NAFE (National Airborne Field Experiment) were two airborne campaigns held in the Goulburn River catchment (Australia) at the end of 2005. These airborne measurements are being used as benchmark data sets for validating the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) ground segment processor over prairies and crops. This paper presents results of soil moisture inversions and brightness temperature simulations at different resolutions from dual-polarisation and multi-angular L-band (1.4 GHz) measurements obtained from two independent radiometers. The aim of the paper is to provide a method that could overcome the limitations of unknown surface roughness for soil moisture retrievals from L-band data. For that purpose, a two-step approach is proposed for areas with low to moderate vegetation. Firstly, a two-parameter inversion of surface roughness and optical depth is used to obtain a roughness correction dependent on land use only. This step is conducted over small areas with known soil moisture. Such roughness correction is then used in the second step, where soil moisture and optical depth are retrieved over larger areas including mixed pixels. This approach produces soil moisture retrievals with root mean square errors between 0.034 m(3) m(-3) and 0.054 m(3) m(-3) over crops, prairies, and mixtures of these two land uses at different resolutions.

AB Sulphur dioxide retrievals of three satellite-based sensors (the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) were performed on the volcanic cloud from the Sierra Negra, Galapagos Islands eruption of October 22 to October 30, 2005. Near-coincidental plume acquisitions on 23 October from each of the sensors were compared spatially on a pixel-by-pixel basis in order to assess the level of agreement between the retrievals. The variation in pixel size and shape between sensors was accounted for by resampling MODIS data to the geometry of the UV sensors.
   It was found that correlations between retrievals were wide ranging with estimates of total tonnage ranging from 60 kt up to 1800 kt. Spatial comparisons show variation according to plume altitude and overpass time and are compounded by interference from other volcanic species as well as individual instrument error.
   The comparison of these sensors provides an insight into the relative merits of each method and illustrates the usefulness of a holistic approach to satellite remote sensing of sulphur dioxide. This will permit the development of more robust retrieval schemes and therefore increasingly reliable estimations of volcanic SO2 emissions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB We describe and validate a model that retrieves fractional snow-covered area and the grain size and albedo of that snow from surface reflectance data (product MOD09GA) acquired by NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS). The model analyzes the MODIS visible, near infrared, and shortwave infrared bands with multiple endmember spectral mixtures from a library of snow, vegetation, rock, and soil. We derive snow spectral endmembers of varying grain size from a radiative transfer model specific to a scene's illumination geometry; spectra for vegetation, rock, and soil were collected in the field and laboratory. We validate the model with fractional snow cover estimates from Landsat Thematic Mapper data, at 30 m resolution, for the Sierra Nevada, Rocky Mountains, high plains of Colorado, and Himalaya. Grain size measurements are validated with field measurements during the Cold Land Processes Experiment, and albedo retrievals are validated with in situ measurements in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. The pixel-weighted average RMS error for snow-covered area across 31 scenes is 5%, ranging from 1% to 13%. The mean absolute error for grain size was 51 mu m and the mean absolute error for albedo was 4.2%. Fractional snow cover errors are relatively insensitive to solar zenith angle. Because MODSCAG is a physically based algorithm that accounts for the spatial and temporal variation in surface reflectances of snow and other surfaces, it is capable of global snow cover mapping in its more computationally efficient, operational mode.

AB Coastal waters (Case 2) are generally more optically complex than oceanic waters and contain much higher quantities of colored detrital matter (CDM, a combination of dissolved organic matter and detrital particulates) as well as suspended sediment. Exclusion of CDM in the retrieval can lead to an overestimation of chlorophyll a concentration (C). We present a validation of a Case 2 version of the coupled spectral optimization algorithm (SOA) for simultaneous atmospheric correction and water parameter retrieval using Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) satellite ocean color data. Modeling of water constituents uses the Carver, Siegel and Maritorena (GSM) semi-analytic bio-optical model locally tuned for Chesapeake Bay. This includes a parameterization for CDM through its absorption spectrum.
   SOA-retrieved C and CDM are compared with in situ measurements in Chesapeake Bay. Results are also compared with output from two alternate models 1) the standard algorithm (Std) and 2) the standard atmospheric correction combined with the locally tuned GSM model (StdGSM). The comparisons indicate that the SOA is a viable alternative to both given models in Chesapeake Bay. In contrast, StdGSM appears to require improvement before it can be considered for operational use in these waters. Perhaps the most important result is the high-quality of CDM retrievals with the SOA, They suggest that there is value added using the SOA method in Chesapeake waters, as the Std method does not retrieve CDM. In a companion paper we describe in detail the model implementation, and its accuracy and limitations when applied to the Chesapeake Bay. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Geosciences Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) space LiDAR data are used to attribute a MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) 500 m land cover classification of a 10 degrees latitude by 12 degrees longitude study area in south-central Siberia. Timber volume estimates are generated for 16 forest classes, i.e., four forest cover types x four canopy density classes, across this 811,414 km(2) area and compared with a ground-based regional volume estimate. Two regional GLAS/MODIS timber volume products, one considering only those pulses falling on slopes <= 10 degrees and one utilizing all GLAS pulses regardless of slope, are generated. Using a two-phase (GLAS-ground plot) sampling design, GLAS/MODIS volumes average 163.4 +/- 11.8 m(3)/ha across all 16 forest classes based on GLAS pulses on slopes <= 10 degrees and 171.9 +/- 12.4 m(3)/ha considering GLAS shots on all slopes. The increase in regional GLAS volume per-hectare estimates as a function of increasing slope most likely illustrate the effects of vertical waveform expansion due to the convolution of topography with the forest canopy response. A comparable, independent, ground-based estimate is 146 m(3)/ha [Shepashenko, D., Shvidenko, A., and Nilsson, S. (1998). Phytomass (live biomass) and carbon of Siberian forests. Biomass and Bioenergy, 14, 21-31], a difference of 11.9% and 17.7% for GLAS shots on slopes <= 10 degrees and all GLAS shots regardless of slope, respectively. A ground-based estimate of total volume for the entire study area, 7.46 x 109 m(3). is derived using Shepashenko et al.'s per-hectare volume estimate in conjunction with forest area derived from a 1990 forest map [Grasia, M.G. (ed.). (1990). Forest Map of USSR. Soyuzgiproleskhoz, Moscow, RU. Scale: 1:2,500,000]. The comparable GLAS/MODIS estimate is 7.38 x 10(9) m(3), a difference of less than 1.1 %. Results indicate that GLAS data can be used to attribute digital land cover maps to estimate forest resources over subcontinental areas encompassing hundreds of thousands of square kilometers.

ID RETRIEVAL; ALGORITHMS; IMAGERY
AB Optimal estimation (OE) is applied as a technique for retrieving sea surface temperature (SST) from thermal imagery obtained by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) on Meteosat 9. OE requires simulation of observations as part of the retrieval process, and this is done here using numerical weather prediction fields and a fast radiative transfer model. Bias correction of the simulated brightness temperatures (BTs) is found to be a necessary step before retrieval, and is achieved by filtered averaging of simulations minus observations over a time period of 20 days and spatial scale of 2.5 degrees in latitude and longitude. Throughout this study, BT observations are clear-sky averages over cells of size 0.5 degrees in latitude and longitude. Results for the OE SST are compared to results using a traditional non-linear retrieval algorithm ("NLSST"), both validated against a set of 30108 night-time matches with drifting buoy observations. For the OE SST the mean difference with respect to drifter SSTs is -0.01 K and the standard deviation is 0.47 K, compared to -0.38 K and 0.70 K respectively for the NLSST algorithm. Perhaps more importantly, systematic biases in NLSST with respect to geographical location, atmospheric water vapour and satellite zenith angle are greatly reduced for the OE SST. However, the OE SST is calculated to have a lower sensitivity of retrieved SST to true SST variations than the NLSST, This feature would be a disadvantage for observing SST fronts and diurnal variability, and raises questions as to how best to exploit OE techniques at SEVIRI's full spatial resolution.

AB The generation of multi-decade long Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR) from remote sensing measurements of multiple sensors is key to monitoring long-term changes in vegetation due to natural and anthropogenic influences. Challenges in developing such ESDRs include problems in remote sensing science (modeling of variability in global vegetation, scaling, atmospheric correction) and sensor hardware (differences in spatial resolution, spectral bands, calibration, and information content). In this paper, we develop a physically based approach for deriving LAI and FPAR products from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data that are of comparable quality to the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI and FPAR products, thus realizing the objective of producing a long (multi-decadal) time series of these products. The approach is based on the radiative transfer theory of canopy spectral invariants which facilitates parameterization of the canopy spectral bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). The methodology permits decoupling of the structural and radiometric components and obeys the energy conservation law. The approach is applicable to any optical sensor, however, it requires selection of sensor-specific values of configurable parameters, namely, the single scattering albedo and data uncertainty. According to the theory of spectral invariants, the single scattering albedo is a function of the spatial scale, and thus, accounts for the variation in BRF with sensor spatial resolution. Likewise, the single scattering albedo accounts for the variation in spectral BRF with sensor bandwidths. The second adjustable parameter is data uncertainty. which accounts for varying information content of the remote sensing measurements, i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, low information content), vs. spectral BRF (higher information content). Implementation of this approach indicates good consistency in LAI values retrieved from NDVI (AVHRR-mode) and spectral BRF (MODIS-mode). Specific details of the implementation and evaluation of the derived products are detailed in the second part of this two-paper series. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A new technology was developed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) for generating Canada-wide and North America continental scale clear-sky composites at 250 m spatial resolution for all seven MODIS land spectral bands (B1-B7). The MODIS Level 1B (MOD02) swath level data are used as input to circumvent the problems with image distortion in the mid latitude and polar regions inherent to the global sinusoidal (SIN) projection utilized for the standard MODIS data products. The MODIS 500 m land bands B3 to B7 are first downscaled to 250 m resolution using an adaptive regression and normalization scheme for compatibility with the 250 m bands B1 and B2. A new method has been developed to produce the mask of clear-sky, cloud and cloud shadow at 250 m resolution. It shows substantial advantages in comparison with the MODIS 250 m standard cloud masks. The testing of new cloud mask showed that it is in reasonable agreement with the MODIS 1-km standard product once it is aggregated to 1-km scale, while the cloud shadow detection looks more reliable with the new methodology. Nevertheless, more quantitative analyses of the presented scene identification technique are required to understand its performance over the range of input scenes in various seasons. The new clear-sky compositing scheme employs a scene-dependent decision matrix. It is demonstrated that this new scheme provides better results than any others based on a single compositing criterion, such as maximum NDVI or minimum visible reflectance. To account for surface bidirectional properties, two clear-sky composites for the same time period are produced by separating backward scattering and forward scattering geometries, which separate pixels with the sun-satellite relative azimuth angles within 90 degrees-270 degrees and outside of this range. Comparison with Landsat imagery and with MODIS standard composite products demonstrated the advantage of the new technique for screening cloud and cloud shadow, and generating high spatial resolution MODIS clear-sky composites. The new data products are mapped in the Lambert Conformal Conic (LCC) projection for Canada and the Lambert Azimuthal Equal-Area (LAEA) projection for North America. Presently this activity is limited to MODIS/TERRA due to known problems with band-to-band registration and noisy SWIR channels on MODIS/AQUA. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Vegetation indices are valuable in many fields of geosciences. Conventional, visible-near infrared, indices are often limited by the effects of atmosphere, background soil conditions, and saturation at high levels of vegetation. In this study, we will establish the theoretical basis for our new passive microwave vegetation indices (MVIs) based on data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on the Aqua satellite. Through the analysis of numerical simulations by surface emission model, the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM), we found that bare soil surface emissivities at different frequencies can be characterized by a linear function with parameters that are dependent on the pair of frequencies used. This makes it possible to minimize the surface emission signal and maximize the vegetation signal when using multi-frequency radiometer measurements. Using a radiative transfer model (omega-tau model), a linear relationship between the brightness temperatures observed at two adjacent radiometer frequencies can be derived. The intercept and slope of this linear function depend only on vegetation properties and can be used as vegetation indices. These can be derived from the dual-frequency and dual-polarization satellite measurements under assumption that there is no significant impact of the polarization dependence on the vegetation signals. To demonstrate the potential of the new microwave vegetation indices, we compared them with the Normalized Difference of Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived using MODIS the optical sensor at continental and global scales. The major purpose of this paper is to describe the concept and techniques involved in these newly developed MVIs and explore the general relationships between these MVIs and NDVI. In this first investigation, the information content of NDVI and MVIs, both are qualitative indices, was compared by examining its response in global pattern and to seasonal vegetation phenology. The results indicate that the MVIs can provide significant new information since the microwave measurements are sensitive not only to the leafy part of vegetation properties but also to the properties of the overall vegetation canopy when the microwave sensor can "see" through it. In combination with conventional optical sensor derived vegetation indices, they provide a possible complementary dataset for monitoring global short vegetation and seasonal phenology from space.

AB We use the Li-Strahler geometric-optical model combined with a scaling-based approach to detect forest structural changes in the Three Gorges region of China. The physical-based Li-Strahler model can be inverted to retrieve forest structural properties. One of the main input variables for the inverted model is the fractional component of sunlit background, which is calculated by using pure reflectance spectra (endmembers) of surface components. In this study, we extract these endmembers from moderate spatial resolution MODIS data using two scaling-based methods (namely, a regional based linear unmixing and a purest-pixel approach) relying on corresponding high spatial resolution Landsat TM images. Then, the forest structural property crown closure (CC) is estimated by inverting the Li-Strahler model based on the extracted endmembers. Changes in CC are mapped using MODIS mosaics dated 2002 and 2004 for the whole Three Gorges region. Validation of the estimated CC using 25 sample sites indicates that the regional scaling-based endmembers extracted using linear unmixing are more suitable to be used in combination with the inverted Li-Strahler model for monitoring the forest CC than the purest-pixel approach, and results in significantly better estimates in both years (R-2002(2)=0.614, RMSE2002=6%, R-2004(2)=0.631 and RMSE2004=5.2%). A change detection map of the model derived CC in 2002 and 2004 shows a decrease in CC in the eastern counties of the Three Gorges region located close to the Three Gorges Dam. An increase in CC has been observed in other counties of the Three Gorges region, implying a preliminary positive feedback on certain policy measures taken safeguarding forest structure.

AB One of the needs of the Pelagos Sanctuary for the Conservation of Mediterranean Marine Mammals is information on critical habitats for cetaceans. This study modelled habitat use and preferences of fin whales and striped dolphins (the two most abundant species in the area) with the aim of providing this information, using sighting data collected between 1993 and 1999. The study area was divided into a 21 latitude by 21 longitude grid. The explanatory variables considered in the models were physiographic variables (mean, range and standard deviation of depth and slope, and distance from the nearest coastline) and remotely-sensed data (Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll-a concentration). The former were calculated for each cell using GIS tools, while the latter were obtained from AVHRR and SeaWiFS sensors. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) with multidimensional smoothers were used to model the distribution of fin whales and striped dolphins in relation to these variables, and Classification And Regression Trees were used for habitat characterization and predictive models. The GAMs were coupled with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) to account for temporal autocorrelation in the errors and to help ensure model selection was reliable; the QIC statistic was used alongside GEE-based p-values. Bathymetric features were the most valuable predictors in the Pelagos Sanctuary area for both species. Sea Surface Temperature values were indicators of striped dolphin and fin whale presence, with both species showing a tendency to prefer colder waters (21-24 degrees C). Chl-a levels were selected by the GAM models only for striped dolphins, and with large associated uncertainty; this may be related to the relatively brief period examined (only 2 years) and/or to any functional relationship operating at a different geographical or temporal scale. The boosted classification trees however indicated an importance of Chl-a for both species. The techniques applied to this dataset proved to be valuable tools to describe habitat use and preferences of cetaceans, and the use of the remotely-sensed data can substantially improve the predictions. The results of this study will be used for assessing critical habitats within the Pelagos Sanctuary and will provide information for conservation and management in the Sanctuary.

AB Data on the distribution of northern minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in the coastal waters of the southern outer Moray Firth in northeast Scotland were collected from May to October, 2000 to 2004 inclusive. During this period, 127 encounters with B. acutorostrata were recorded during systematic boat-based surveys. The encounters were subsequently converted to number of animals sighted per unit of survey effort (SPUE) for comparison with mesoscale oceanographic features. Using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) imagery, monthly composite images of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) were obtained. In the SST imagery two oceanographic features appeared to dominate the Moray Firth region: a cold water current and a warm water plume. The results show that the SPUE of B. acutorostrata was significantly higher during warm plume events than when the cold current was dominant (Mann-Whitney U, P=0.0167). Levels of phytoplankton biomass also appeared to be substantially greater during warm water plume events. In conclusion, it is hypothesised that those areas of highest minke SPUE are directly related to the presence of targeted prey attracted by high densities of phytoplankton. Although these whales were found to occur across the survey area, throughout the study period, their distribution is concluded to be highly dependent upon the presence of co-occurring mesoscale features. These, as well as other physiographic environmental determinants, are all thought to be important in forming this heterogeneous coastal ecosystem. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Long-term vegetation dynamics associated with climatic changes can be assessed using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) red and near-infrared reflectance data provided that the data have been processed to remove the effects of non-target signal variability, such as atmospheric and sensor calibration effects. Here we present a new method that performs a relative calibration of reflectance data to produce consistent long-term vegetation information. It is based on a simple biological framework that assumes that the position of the vegetation cover triangle is invariant in reflectance space. This assumption is in fact an intrinsic assumption behind the commonly used Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and is violated when the NDVI is calculated from inadequately corrected reflectance data. In this new method, any temporal variability in the position of the cover triangle is removed by geometrically transforming the observed reflectance data such that two features of the triangle-the soil line and the dark point-are stationary in reflectance space. The fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation absorbed by vegetation (fPAR; 0.0-0.95) is then calculated, via the NDVI, from calibrated reflectances. This method was tested using two distinct, monthly AVHRR products for Australia: (i) the coarse-resolution, fully calibrated, partially atmospherically corrected PAL data (1981-1994); and (ii) the fine-resolution, fully calibrated, non-atmospherically Corrected HRPT data (1992-2004). Results show that, in the 20-month period when the two datasets overlap (1992-1994), the Australia-wide, root mean square difference between the two datasets improved from 0.098 to 0.027 WAR units. The calibrations have produced two approximately equivalent datasets that can be combined as a single input into time-series analyses. The application of this method is limited to areas that have a wide-enough variety of land-cover types so that the soil line and dark point are evident in the cover triangle in every image of the time-series. Another limitation is that the methodology performs only bulk, relative calibrations and does not remove the absolute effects of observation uncertainties. The simplicity of the method means that the calibration procedure can be easily incorporated into near-real-time operational remote-sensing environments.

AB Operational weather geostationary satellites have acquired data for more than two decades and offer thus the possibility to generate long time series of Essential Climate Variables like surface albedo as suggested by GCOS. This paper investigates the possibility to generate consistent global, to the exception of the polar regions, surface broadband albedo product from these satellites. In this context, the paper addresses two specific issues. Firstly, the spatial consistency of surface albedo derived from five different geostationary satellites is examined in detail. Secondly, this product is compared with the equivalent MODIS one to define the temporal consistency between surface albedo derived with old geostationary instruments and technologically advanced radiometers like MODIS. The analysis of the surface albedo products has revealed a good agreement between the products derived from the various geostationary satellites. Comparison of this global product with the one routinely derived from MODIS shows that on the average, the mean relative difference between these two data sets agree within 10%. These first encouraging results open therefore a new avenue for the exploitation of the archived data for the generation of long time series, covering the last 25 years or so, of global surface albedo from geostationary weather satellites.

TI Estimates of sea surface nitrate concentrations from sea surface

AB The knowledge of nitrate fields at global or regional scales in the ocean is fundamental for the study of oceanic biogeochemical processes, particularly those linked to new primary production. The estimate of nitrate concentrations from space is generally based on empirical inverse relationships between sea surface temperature (SST) and nitrate concentrations. These relationships, however, are often highly variable spatially and temporally, and hardly applicable to large areas (i.e., larger than a few degrees in latitude). In this paper we propose a new approach specifically developed for areas influenced by upwelling processes. It relates the nitrate concentration to the difference between SST and the estimated temperature of the upwelled water (variable with latitude and season), delta T, which is an indicator of the time elapsed since upwelling. This approach is tested for the Benguela upwelling system, and algorithms are developed using in situ data provided by the World Ocean Database 2005 of the NOAA-NESDIS-National Oceanographic Data Center. The results reveal a significant improvement compared to the NO3-SST relationships, and a single algorithm can be applied to the whole upwelling area (15 to 35 degrees S). Further improvement is gained by coupling this approach with a method that derives sea surface nitrate concentrations from SST and surface chlorophyll a concentration using multiple regression analyses, as proposed by Goes et al. [Goes, Saino, Oaku, Jiang, (1999). Method for estimating sea surface nitrate concentrations from remotely sensed SST and chlorophyll a: A case study for the North Pacific Ocean using OCTS/ADEOS data.

AB Vegetation structure is an important factor that influences wildlife-habitat selection, reproduction, and survival. However, field-based measurements of vegetation structure can be time consuming, costly, and difficult to undertake in areas that are remote and/or contain rough terrain. Light detection and ranging (lidar) is an active remote sensing technology that can quantify three-dimensional vegetation structure over large areas and thus holds promise for examining wildlife-habitat relationships. We used discrete-return airborne lidar data acquired over the Black Hills Experimental Forest in South Dakota, USA in combination with field-collected vegetation and bird data to assess the utility of lidar data in quantifying vegetation structural characteristics that relate to avian diversity, density, and occurrence. Indices of foliage height diversity calculated from lidar data were positively and significantly correlated with indices of bird species diversity, with the highest correlations observed when foliage height diversity categories contained proportionally more foliage layers near the forest floor (<5 m). In addition, lidar-derived indices of vegetation volume were significantly correlated with bird density. Using lidar-derived vegetation height data in combination with multispectral IKONOS data, we delineated five general habitat types within the study area according to the presence of prominent vegetation layers at lower levels of the forest and predominant tree type (deciduous or conifer). Habitat type delineations were tested by examining the occurrence and relative density of two bird species common to the study area that prefer lower level vegetation for foraging and nesting. Dark-eyed Juncos were significantly associated with the 0.5-2.0 m high vegetation layer in pine-dominated stands, and Warbling Vireos were significantly associated with this same layer in aspen-dominated stands. These results demonstrate that discrete-return lidar can be an effective tool to remotely quantify vegetation structural attributes important to birds, and may be enhanced when used in combination with spectral data.

AB Woody lianas are critical to tropical forest dynamics because of their strong influence on forest regeneration, disturbance ecology, and biodiversity. Recent studies synthesizing plot data from the tropics indicate that lianas are increasing in both abundance and importance in tropical forests. Moreover, lianas exhibit competitive advantages over trees in elevated CO2 environments and under strong seasonal droughts, suggesting that lianas may be poised to increase not only in abundance but also in spatial distribution in response to changing climate. We used a combination of high-resolution color-infrared videography and hyperspectral imagery from EO-1 Hyperion to map low-lying lianas in Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP) in the Bolivian Amazon. Evergreen liana forests comprise as much as 14% of the NKMNP landscape, and low-stature liana patches occupy 1.5% of these forests. We used change vector analysis (CVA) of dry season Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery from 1986 and 2000 to determine changes in liana-dominated patches over time and to assess whether those patches were regenerating to canopy forest. The spatial distribution of liana patches showed that patches were spatially aggregated and were preferentially located in proximity to waterways. The CVA results showed that most of the dense liana patches increased in brightness and greenness and decreased in wetness over the 14 years of the change analysis, while non-liana forest patches changed less and in more random directions. Persistent liana patches increased in area by an average of 59% over the time period. In comparison, large burned areas appeared to recover completely to canopy forest in the same time period. This suggests that the dense liana patches of NKMNP represent an alternative successional pathway characterized not by tree regeneration but rather by a stalled state of low-canopy liana dominance. This research supports hypotheses that liana forests can be a persistent rather than transitional component of tropical forests, and may remain so due to competitive advantages that lianas enjoy under changing climatic conditions.

AB The latitudinal tree cover gradient is an important characteristic of the tundra-taiga transition zone stretching around the northern hemisphere. Accurately mapped continuous tree cover fields would enable the depiction of forest extent over this ecotone, which is sensitive to climate change, natural disturbances and human activities. The objective of this study was to assess the explanatory power of multispectral, -temporal and -angular MODIS data to estimate tree cover at the regional scale in northernmost Finland. The standard MODIS BRDF/Albedo (MOD43B) data products at approximately 1 km resolution were used. The tree cover was estimated using generalized linear models (GLM), which were calibrated and evaluated by high resolution biotope inventory data. The benefit of coupling the multispectral, -temporal and -angular variables was assessed by variation partitioning. The predicted tree cover fields were also used for the forest-non-forest classification over a larger region and compared with the forest extent of Finnish CORINE land cover 2000 data set. The results show that multitemporal and -angular variables can increase the accuracy of the tree cover estimates and mapping of the forest extent in comparison to the peak of the growing season nadir-view multispectral data. The season of the data acquisition also affect the model performance, the late-spring and early-summer data being superior to mid- and late-summer data. Although the pure effect of the multiangular variables i.e. the parameters of the MODIS BRDF model and selected multiangular indices were relatively small in the models, the inclusion of these data increased the accuracy of the tree cover estimates in the mires in comparison to the peak of the growing season nadir-view multispectral data and multitemporal variables.

AB The derivation of leaf area index (LAI) from satellite optical data has been the subject of a large amount of work. In contrast, few papers have addressed the effective model inversion of high resolution satellite images for a complete series of data for the various crop species in a given region. The present study is focused on the assessment of a LAI model inversion approach applied to multitemporal optical data, over an agricultural region having various crop types with different crop calendars. Both the inversion approach and data sources are chosen because of their wide use. Crops in the study region (Barrax, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) include: cereal, corn, alfalfa, sugar beet, onion, garlic, papaver. Some of the crop types (onion, garlic, papaver) have not been addressed in previous studies. We use in-situ measurement sets and literature values as a priori data in the PROSPECT+ SAIL models to produce Look Up Tables (LUTs). Those LUTs are subsequently used to invert Landsat-TM and Landsat-ETM+ image series (12 dates from March to September 2003). The Look Up Tables are adapted to different crop types, identified on the images by ground survey and by Landsat classification. The retrieved LAI values are compared to in-situ measurements available from the campaign conducted in mid July-2003. Very good agreement (a high linear correlation) is obtained for LAI values from 0.1 to 6.0. LAI maps are then produced for each of the 12 dates. The LAI temporal variation shows consistency with the crop phenological stages. The inversion method is favourably compared to a method relying on the empirical relationship between LAI and NDVI from Landsat data. This offers perspectives for future optical satellite data that will ensure high resolution and high temporal frequency. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All fights reserved.

AB The Fire Potential Index (FPI) relies on relative greenness (RG) estimates from remote sensing data. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery is currently used to calculate RG operationally. Here we evaluated an alternate measure of RG using the Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index (VARI) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. VARI was chosen because it has previously been shown to have the strongest relationship with Live Fuel Moisture (LFM) out of a wide selection of MODIS-derived indices in southern California shrublands. To compare MODIS-based NDVI-FPI and VARI-FPI, RG was calculated from a 6-year time series of MODIS composites and validated against in-situ observations of LFM as a surrogate for vegetation greenness. RG from both indices was then compared in terms of its performance for computing the FPI using historical wildfire data. Computed RG values were regressed against ground-sampled LFM at 14 sites within Los Angeles County. The results indicate that VARI-based RG consistently shows a stronger relationship with observed LFM than NDVI-based RG. With an average R-2 of 0.727 compared to a value of only 0.622 for NDVI-RG, VARI-RG showed stronger relationships at 13 out of 14 sites. Based on these results, daily FPI maps were computed for the years 2001 through 2005 using both NDVI-RG and VARI-RG. These were then validated against 12,490 fire detections from the MODIS active fire product using logistic regression. Deviance of the logistic regression model was 408.8 for NDVI-FPI and 176.2 for VARI-FPI. The c-index was found to be 0.69 and 0.78, respectively. The results show that VARI-FPI outperforms NDVI-FPI in distinguishing between fire and no-fire events for historical wildfire data in southern California for the given time period.

AB Validation comparisons between satellite-based surface energy balance models and tower-based flux measurements over heterogeneous landscapes can be strongly influenced by the spatial resolution of the remote sensing inputs. In this paper, a two-source energy balance model developed to use thermal and visible/near-infrared remotely sensed data is applied to Landsat imagery collected during the 2004 Soil Moisture Experiment (SMEX04) conducted in southern Arizona. Using a two dimensional flux-footprint algorithm, modeled surface fluxes are compared to tower measurements at three locations in the SMEX04 study area: two upland sites, and one riparian site. The effect of pixel resolution on evaluating the performance of the land surface model and interpreting spatial variations of land surface fluxes over these heterogeneous areas is evaluated. Three Landsat scenes were examined, one representing the dry season and the other two representing the relatively wet monsoon season. The model was run at three resolution scales: namely the Landsat visible/near-infrared band resolution (30 m), the Landsat 5 thermal band resolution (120 m), and 960 m, which is nominally the MODIS thermal resolution at near-nadir. Comparisons between modeled and measured fluxes at the three tower sites showed good agreement at the 30 m and 120 m resolutions - pixel scales at which the source area influencing the tower measurement (similar to 100 m) is reasonably resolved. At 960 m, the agreement is relatively poor, especially for the latent heat flux, due to subpixel heterogeneity in land surface conditions at scales exceeding the tower footprint. Therefore in this particular landscape, thermal data at 1-km resolution are not useful in assessing the intrinsic accuracy of the land-surface model in comparison with tower fluxes. Furthermore, important spatial patterns in the landscape are lost at this resolution. Currently, there are no definite plans supporting high resolution thermal data with regular global coverage below similar to 700 m after Landsat 5 and ASTER fail. This will be a serious problem for the application and validation of thermal-based land-surface models over heterogeneous landscapes. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB For the validation of snow/ice products of the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite-II/Global Imager (ADEOS-II/GLI), several field campaigns were performed for various types of snow conditions with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and GLI overpasses at four sites in Alaska and eastern Hokkaido, Japan from 2001 to 2005. The target satellite-derived snow parameters are snow surface temperature, mass fraction of soot, and two types of snow grain size retrieved from different spectral channels. The retrieved satellite products were compared with in-situ measured snow parameters based on snow pit work and snow sampling. The satellite-derived snow surface temperatures agreed well with in-situ measured values with a correlation coefficient (R-c) of 0.900 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.1 K. The satellite-derived mass fractions of soot were close to in-situ measured mass fractions of snow impurities for the snow layer between the surface and down to 7 or 10 cm rather than between 0 and 2 cm, while the satellite-derived absolute values were lower than the in-situ measured ones (R-c=0.506 and RMSE=5.0 parts per million by weight (ppmw)). This discrepancy is due primarily to the difference in the composition of snow impurities assumed in the satellite algorithm (soot) and measured in-situ (mineral dust) suggesting that the satellite retrieval of soot is not producing soot concentrations in many cases but rather dust. Snow grain sizes retrieved from two satellite channels lambda = 0.460 and 0.865 pm had better accuracy (R-c =0.840 and RMSE = 125 mu m) than those from a satellite channel at lambda = 1.64 mu m (R-c=0.524 and RMSE = 123 mu m) from the comparison with simply depth-averaged snow grain size. When similar comparisons are made with the depth-averaged measured grain size by a 1/e weighting using flux transmittance, the results for R-c and RMSE are not improved due to some difficulties in calculating the depth-averaging by a 1/e weighting. For all our satellite products, the possible causes of errors are (1) satellite sensor calibration and (2) the bidirectional reflectance model (directional emissivity model for surface temperature) used in the algorithm together with the atmospheric correction. Two ways to improve the in-situ measurements are (1) the representativeness of the measured values and (2) the measuring methods. Field measurements also indicated that the increased reflectance due to "sun crust" observed at wet snow surfaces under clear sky could cause an underestimation of satellite-derived snow grain size. This problem will be more severe for the grain size retrieved from the channel at lambda = 1.64 mu m. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Coupling radiative transfer models for the soil background and vegetation canopy layers is facilitated by means of the four-stream flux interaction concept and use of the adding method. Also the coupling to a state-of-the-art atmospheric radiative transfer model like MODTRAN4 can be established in this way, thus enabling the realistic simulation of top-of-atmosphere radiances detected by space-bome remote sensing instruments. Possible applications of coupled modeling vary from mission design to parameter retrieval and data assimilation. This paper introduces a modified Hapke soil BRDF model, a robust version of the PROSPECT leaf model, and a modernized canopy radiative transfer model called 4SAIL2. The latter is a hybrid two-layer version of SAIL accommodating horizontal and vertical heterogeneities, featuring improved modeling of the hot spot effect and output of canopy absorptances. The integrated model is simply called SLC (soil-leaf-canopy) and has been implemented as a speed-optimized Windows DLL which allows efficient use of computer resources even when simulating massive amounts of hyperspectral multi-angular observations. In this paper various examples of possible model output are shown, including simulated satellite image products. First validation results have been obtained from atmospherically corrected hyperspectral multi-angular CHRIS-PROBA data of the Upper Rhine Valley in Germany, (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB We observed surface water in a wetland, imaging in the subsolar or specular direction the exceptionally bright specular reflection of sunlight at aground resolution of 0.3 m. We then simulated ground resolutions between 1.7 m and 1.2 km through aggregation of the 0.3 m pixels. Contrary to the expectations of some of our colleagues in the wetlands community, for these data, the accuracy of spectral mixture analysis (SMA) estimates of surface water increases as pixel ground footprint size increases. Our results suggest that regional to global scale assessments of flooded landscapes and wetlands that do not involve issues requiring I m resolution per se may be addressed with acceptable accuracy by applying SMA techniques to low resolution imagery. Our results indicate within-pixel estimates of surface water area derived from data measured by subsolar viewing sensors with large ground pixel footprints, such as satellite POLarization and Directionality (of Earth Radiance (POLDER) data, may be highly accurate under strong surface wind conditions.

AB Burn severity is a key factor in post-fire assessment and its estimation is traditionally restricted to field work and empirical fitting from remotely sensed data. However, the first method is limited in terms of spatial coverage and cost effectiveness and the second is site- and data-specific. Since alternative approaches based on radiative transfer models (RTM) have been usefully applied in retrieving several biophysical plant parameters (leaf area index, water and dry matter content, chlorophyll), this paper has applied the inversion of a simulation model to estimate burn severity in terms of the Composite Burn Index (CBI). The performance of the model inversion method was compared to standard empirical techniques. The study area chosen was a large forest fire in central Spain which occurred in July 2005. The model inversion showed the most accurate estimation for high severity levels (for CBI > 2.7, RMSE=0.30) and for unburned areas (CBI < 0.5, RMSE=0). In both methodologies, the error associated to CBI from 0.5 to 2.7 was not acceptable (RMSE > 0.1), because it is higher than 25% of the total range of the index. Finally, burn severity maps from both methods were compared. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the use of time series of SAR images to map the flood temporal dynamics and the spatial distribution of vegetation over a large Amazonian floodplain. The region under study (3500 km(2)) presents a diversity of landscape units with open lakes, bogs, large meadows, savannahs, alluvial forests and terra firma forest, covered by 21 images acquired by J-ERS between 1993 and 1997. Ground data include in situ observations of vegetation structure and flood extent as well as water level records. Image analysis demonstrates that temporal variations of the radar backscatter can be used to monitor efficiently the flood extent regardless of the landscape units. Also, analysis of the backscatter temporal variation greatly reduces the confusion between smooth surfaces (e.g. open water bodies, bare soils) inherent to L-band backscatter. The mapping method is based on decision rules over two decision variables: 1) the mean backscatter coefficient computed over the whole time series; 2) the total change computed using an "Absolute Change" estimator. The first variable provides classification into rough vegetation types while the second variable yields a direct estimate of the intensity of change that is related to flood dynamics. The classifier is first applied to the whole time series to map the maximum and minimum flood extent by defining 3 flood conditions: never flooded (NF); occasionally flooded (OF); permanently flooded (PF). It also furnishes the broad land cover type: open water/bare soils/low vegetation/forest. The accuracy of the flood extent mapping shows a kappa value of 0.82. Then, the classifier is run iteratively on the OF pixels to monitor flood stages during which the occasionally flooded areas get submerged. The mapping accuracy is assessed on one intermediate flood stage, showing a precision in excess of 90%. The importance of the time sampling for flood mapping is discussed along with the influence of SAR backscatter accuracy and the number of images. Then general guidelines for floodplain mapping are presented. By combining water level reports with maps of different flood stages the flooding pattern can be retrieved along with the vegetation succession processes. It is shown that the spatial distribution of vegetation communities is governed by flood stress and can be modelled as a function of the mean annual exposure to floods. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB A number of studies have reported on environmental degradation in the Nepal Himalaya as a result of large-scale deforestation and the associated agricultural extension. In contrast to many previous regional scale studies, we consider land cover and its environmental impact on an individual catchment-scale, using fine-resolution Quickbird data and a soil erosion model. First, using a detailed land cover map generated from Quickbird imagery, we establish basic relationships between land cover, dwelling density and topographic variability, which exist in a typical mid-elevation Nepalese catchment, the Pokhare Khola. These data suggest a strongly subsistence type of household economy based predominantly on terraced arable farming. We demonstrate using multitemporal vegetation indices that this farmland has existed in the region since the late 1980s, and that widespread deforestation has not taken place since then, possibly as a result of specific forest conservation policies of the government coupled with efforts by local communities. Further, through the use of soil erosion modelling we demonstrate the role that the terraced farming practices can play in reducing runoff and hence soil nutrient loss, thereby enabling restoration of vegetation in the previously deforested land terrains. Finally, by combining this information with regional land cover data, we show that the findings of this research can be scaled up to draw conclusions about environmental degradation across the Nepal Himalayan region.

AB The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument provides global imagery at nine discrete viewing angles and four visible/near-infrared spectral bands. MISR standard products include green leaf area index (LAI) of vegetation and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (FPAR). This paper describes the research basis for transitioning the MISR LAI/FPAR products from provisional to validation status. The efforts included not only comparisons to field data but also analyses of relationships, consistency and complementarity between various MISR products derived by independent algorithms. For example, we show how the energy absorbed by the ground below vegetation can be estimated from two independent MISR products, FPAR and BHRPAR (bi-hemispheric reflectance at PAR wavelengths). Further, we show that this information can be used to derive at least three measures of canopy structure - Beer's law extinction coefficient, mean leaf inclination and the gap fraction or vegetation ground cover. The spatial and temporal coverage of the LAI/FPAR product is mainly limited by cloud contamination. However, when a successful aerosol retrieval is performed, typically 95% of pixels have surface reflectance retrievals suitable as input to the LAI/FPAR algorithm. The algorithm provides LAI/FPAR retrievals in 50-80% of these pixels with suitable input. The early versions of the algorithm overestimated LAI values in grasses and broadleaf crops. The MISR LAI product from the recalibrated algorithm (version 3.3) is assessed by comparison with field data collected in a 3 x 3 km agricultural area (grasses and cereal crops) near Avignon, France. LAI retrievals in other biomes are compared to MODIS LAI product of known accuracy. The MISR LAI product shows structural and phenological variability in agreement with data. Our results suggest that the product is accurate to within 0.66 LAI in herbaceous vegetation and savannas and is an overestimate by about 1 LAI in broadleaf forests. LAI retrievals over needle leaf forests remain at provisional quality level. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data retrieved by the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) from 2002 to 2004 were compared with AOT measurements from an Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site located in Beijing urban area. AERONET AOT data were first averaged within a two-hour time window and MISR data were collected using AOTs of the central regions covering the AERONET site and the average AOTs of the surrounding 3 x 3 regions. MISR and AERONET AOTs are highly correlated, with an overall linear correlation coefficient of 0.93 at 558 nm wavelength. On average, MISR AOT at 558 nm is 29% lower than the AERONET AOT at 558 nm interpolated from 440 rim and 675 nm. A linear regression analysis using MISR AOT as the response yields a slope of 0.58 0.03 and an intercept of 0.07 +/- 0.02 in the green band with similar results in the other three bands, indicating that MISR may underestimate AERONETAOT. After applying a narrower averaging time window to AERONET data and controlling their temporal variabilities, the agreement between MISR and AERONET AOTs is significantly improved with the correlation coefficient of 0.97 and a slope of 0.71 0.03 in an ordinary linear least squares fit. Aweighted linear least squares, which reduces the impact of spatial averaging, yields a better result with the slope going up to 0.73 +/- 0.03. When only the central region MISR AOTs are included in the regression analysis, the best agreement is achieved with a slope of 0.91 +/- 0.03 and an intercept of 0.00 +/- 0.01, and MISR AOT is only 9% lower than AERONET AOT on average. By investigating PM10 spatial distribution of Beijing, we found substantial spatial variations of aerosol loading with higher PM10 concentrations inthe MISR central region, which introduced low bias invalidating spatial average MISRAOT. When MISR andAERONETAOTare better spatiotemporally matched, their agreement can be much better than the previously reported results. Our findings also suggest that MISR aerosol retrieval algorithm might need to be adjusted for the extremely high aerosol loadings and substantial spatial variations that it will probably encounter in heavily polluted metropolitan areas.

AB Satellite aerosol data provide good temporal sampling and superior spatial coverage relative to ground-based stations, especially over the Indian subcontinent. We have used ground-based Kanpur Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) station aerosol optical depth (AOD), located in the central part of the Indo-Gangetic (IG) basin, to validate Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra level 3 AOD products for the 2001-2005 summer and winter seasons. MISR has been found to perform better than MODIS during both seasons, which we attribute to its unique design (viewing and spectral capability), despite its lower revisit frequency compared to MODIS. In both seasons, the MISR level 3 product distinctly shows a large gradient of AOD along north-south (N-S) and west-east (W-E) transects over the IG basin, compared to the southern part of the Indian subcontinent. An increase in satellite-derived aerosol loading over the 2000-2005 time period has been found over major cities located in the IG basin; this increase is also reflected in ground-based air quality data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). High MISR AOD during the winter season can be attributed primarily to anthropogenic activities, as major dust storms take place during summer (April-June). We have computed the spatial correlation between MISR and MODIS AOD during the 2000-2005 winter (November-January) seasons, when the effect of desert dust is smallest and the anthropogenic component over the IG basin is largest. The average pixel count with MISR-MODIS correlation coefficient > 0.6 during the winter season has been found to be higher over the IG basin and India (35.6% and 32.2% of pixels, respectively) compared to the world (20.4% of pixels). Since the MODIS AOD retrieval algorithm works best for dense and dark vegetative regions, whereas the MISR retrieval is generally less sensitive to surface type, we attribute this result to the relatively high vegetation cover (using MISR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as a proxy) found in the IG basin and over India.

AB The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission distinguished itself as the first near-global spaceborne mission to demonstrate direct sensitivity to vertical vegetation structure. Whether this sensitivity is viewed as exploitable signal or unwanted bias, a great deal of interest exists in retrieving vegetation canopy height information from the SRTM data. This study presents a comprehensive application-specific assessment of SRTM data quality, focusing on the characterization and mitigation of two primary sources of relative vertical error: uncompensated Shuttle mast motion and random phase noise. The assessment spans four test sites located in the upper Midwestern United States and examines the dependence of data quality on both frequency, i.e., C-band vs. X-band, and the number of acquired datatakes. The results indicate that the quality of SRTM data may be higher than previously thought. Novel mitigation strategies include a knowledge-based approach to sample averaging, which has the potential to reduce phase noise error by 43 to 80%. The strategies presented here are being implemented as part of an ongoing effort to produce regional- to continental-scale estimates of vegetation canopy height within the conterminous U.S. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB A great number of spectral vegetation indices (VIls) have been developed to estimate biophysical parameters of vegetation. Traditional techniques for evaluating the performance of VIs are regress ion-based statistics, such as the coefficient of determination and root mean square error. These statistics, however, are not capable of quantifying the detailed relationship between VIs and biophysical parameters because the sensitivity of a VI is usually a function of the biophysical parameter instead of a constant. To better quantify this relationship, we developed a "sensitivity function" for measuring the sensitivity of a VI to biophysical parameters. The sensitivity function is defined as the first derivative of the regression function, divided by the standard error of the dependent variable prediction. The function elucidates the change in sensitivity over the range of the biophysical parameter. The Student's t- or z-statistic can be used to test the significance of VI sensitivity. Additionally, we developed a "relative sensitivity function" that compares the sensitivities of two VIs when the biophysical parameters are unavailable. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Surface chlorophyll a concentrations (C-a, mg m(-3)) in the Southern Ocean estimated from SeaWiFS satellite data have been reported in the literature to be significantly lower than those measured from in situ water samples using fluorometric methods. However, we found that high-resolution (similar to 1 km(2)/pixel) daily SeaWiFS C-a (C-a(SWF)) data (SeaDAS4.8, OC4v4 algorithm) was an accurate measure of in situ C-a during January-February of 1998-2002 if concurrent in situ data measured by HPLC (C-a(HPLC)) instead of fluorometric (C-a(Fluor)) measurements were used as ground truth. Our analyses indicate that C-a(Fluor) is 2.48 +/- 2.23 (n = 647) times greater than C-a(HPLC) between 0.05 and 1.5 mg m(-3) and that the percentage overestimation of in situ C, by fluorometric measurements increases with decreasing concentrations. The ratio of C-a(SWF)/C-a(PLC) is 1.12 +/- 0.91 (n = 96), whereas the ratio of C-a(SWF)/Ca-Fluor is 0.55 +/- 0.63 (n = 307). Furthermore, there is no significant bias in C-a(SWF) (12% and -0.07 in linear and log-transformed C-a, respectively) when C-a(HPLC) is used as ground truth instead of C-a(Fluor). The high C-a(Fluor)/C-a(HPLC) ratio may be attributed to the relatively low concentrations of chlorophyll b (C-b/C-a = 0.023 +/- 0.034, n = 482) and relatively high concentrations of chlorophyll c (C-c/C-a = 0.25 +/- 0.59, n = 482) in the phytoplankton pigment composition when compared to values from other regions. Because more than 90% of the waters in the study area, as well as in the entire Southern Ocean (south of 60 degrees S), have C-a(SWF) between 0.05 and 1.5 mg m(-3), we consider that the SeaWiFS performance of C-a retrieval is satisfactory and for this C-a range there is no need to further develop a "regional" bio-optical algorithm to account for the previous SeaWiFS "underestimation".

AB There is considerable interest in using remote sensing to characterize the hydrologic behavior of the land surface on a routine basis. Information on moisture fluxes between the surface and lower atmosphere reveals linkages and land-atmosphere feedback mechanisms, aiding our understanding of energy and water balance cycles. Techniques that combine information on land and atmospheric properties with remotely sensed variables would allow improved prediction for a number of hydrological variables. Over the last few decades, there has been a focus on better determining evapotranspiration and its spatial variability, but for many regions routine prediction is not generally available at a spatial resolution appropriate to the underlying surface heterogeneity. Over agricultural regions, this is particularly critical, since the spatial extent of typical field scales is not regularly resolved within the pixel resolution of satellite sensors. Understanding the role of landscape heterogeneity and its influence on the scaling behavior of surface fluxes as observed by satellite sensors with different spatial resolutions is a critical research need. To attend this task, data from Landsat-ETM (60 in), ASTER (90 m), and MODIS (1020 in) satellite platforms are employed to independently estimate evapotranspiration. The range of the satellite sensor resolutions allows analyses that span scales from (point-scale) in-situ tower measurements to the MODIS kilometer-scale. Evapotranspiration estimates derived at these multiple resolutions were assessed against eddy covariance flux measurements collected during the 2002 Soil Moisture Atmospheric Coupling Experiment (SMACEX) over the Walnut Creek watershed in Iowa. Together, these data allow a comprehensive scale intercomparison of remotely sensed predictions, which include intercomparisons of the evapotranspiration products from the various sensors as well as a statistical analysis for the retrievals at the watershed scale. A high degree of consistency was observed between the retrievals from the higher-resolution satellite platforms (Landsat-ETM and ASTER). The MODIS-based estimates, while unable to discriminate the influence of land surface heterogeneity at the field scale, effectively reproduced the watershed average response, illustrating the utility of this sensor for regional-scale evapotranspiration estimation.

AB The MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) primary productivity products are evaluated against observed Above-ground Net Primary Production (AGNPP) in the semi-arid Senegal 2001. MODIS net primary productivity (NPP) modelling is a light use efficiency (LUE) based approach incorporating constraints on vegetation productivity arising from simulated radiation, water demand and temperature data from NASA's Data Assimilation Office (DAO). Annually integrated MODIS PSN (MOD17A2 net photosynthesis, Collection 4) explains more of the observed biomass variation (r(2) = 0.77) than MODIS fAPAR (fraction Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, Collection 4) (r(2) = 0.72), indicating the effect of including the canopy stress scalar (epsilon(s)) based on DAO data combined with modelled maintenance respiration costs (of leaf and fine roots). Annual MODIS NPP (MOD17A3, Collection 4 (C4) and Collection 4.5 (C4.5)) including growth respiration and live wood maintenance respiration costs and 2 modified DAO input (C4.5) however increases the residual unexplained observed AGNPP variance (C4 NPP; r(2) = 0.49) (C4.5 NPP; r(2) = 0.37). The overall quality of the annual NPP MODIS C4 and C4.5 products are moderate for the semi-arid Senegal because of the annual respiration cost modelling and a change in C4.5 biome-specific parameters stored in a Biome Properties Look-Up Table (BPLUT) is the main contributor to the observed discrepancy between C4 and C4.5 NPP. The dynamic range of the values of all MOD 17 products was too low when compared to observed AGNPP. An estimate of canopy water stress (SIWSI; Shortwave Infrared Water Stress Index) derived from MODIS channels 2 and 6 and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) irradiance derived from geostationary METEOSAT data were tested for primary production modelling using a stepwise linear regression analysis. PAR irradiance was combined with MODIS fAPAR into APAR (Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) explaining 79% of the observed AGNPP variation. Introducing SIWSI significantly increased the explained variance of observed AGNPP (r(2)=0.89). MODIS-derived percentage tree cover was tested as a predictor based on the hypothesis that tree cover provides information on differences in respiratory costs between trees and grasses thereby accounting for variations in the LUE conversion efficiency epsilon. No significant reduction in residual unexplained AGNPP variance was found. Earth observation based derivation of PAR and canopy water stress from SIWSI suggest potential improvements to primary production models in semi-arid biomes that can be implemented in general NPP modelling LUE methodology.

AB The ongoing mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, has reached epidemic proportions, with the beetle expanding into geographic areas outside its known biological range. In this study, estimates of red attack damage were derived from a logistic regression model using multi-date Landsat imagery, and ancillary information including terrain attributes and solar radiation. The model estimates were found to be approximately 70% accurate using an independent set of beetle survey data as validation. This probability surface of red attack damage, along with forest inventory and terrain attributes, were used as inputs to decision tree analyses, in order to identify which forest attributes were associated with stands that had a greater likelihood of mountain pine beetle red attack damage. Three distinct decision tree models were developed, with each having a different set of input variables. The results of the analyses indicated that site index (an indicator of the quality of a forest site) and slope were the principal discriminators of the current mountain pine beetle attack, followed by basal area of pine dominated stands, and to a lesser extent, crown closure and stem density. The results suggest that indicators of site quality, particularly site index, could be a complementary addition to existing stand susceptibility rating models. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

AB Hyperspectral remote sensing provides great potential to monitor and study biodiversity of tropical forests through species identification and mapping. In this study, five species were selected to examine crown-level spectral variation within and between species using HYperspectral Digital Collection Experiment (HYDICE) data collected over La Selva, Costa Rica. Spectral angle was used to evaluate the spectral variation in reflectance, first derivative and wavelet-transformed spectral domains. Results indicated that intra-crown spectral variation does not always follow a normal distribution and can vary from crown to crown, therefore presenting challenges to statistically define the spectral variation within species using conventional classification approaches that assume normal distributions. Although derivative analysis has been used extensively in hyperspectral remote sensing of vegetation, our results suggest that it might not be optimal for species identification in tropical forestry using airborne hyperspectral data. The wavelet-transformed spectra, however, were useful for the identification of tree species. The wavelet coefficients at coarse spectral scales and the wavelet energy feature are more capable of reducing variation within crowns/species and capturing spectral differences between species. The implications of this examination of intra- and inter-specific variability at crown-level were: (1) the wavelet transform is a robust tool for the identification of tree species using hyperspectral data because it can provide a systematic view of the spectra at multiple scales; and (2) it may be impractical to identify every species using only hyperspectral data, given that spectral similarity may exist between species and that within-crown/species variability may be influenced by many factors.

AB The accuracy of the sea ice concentration estimates in polar regions is reduced by the effects of atmospheric emission and absorption. A method is presented where a fast atmospheric radiative transfer model and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model fields are used to correct brightness temperatures before they enter the sea ice concentration algorithm. The skill of the method is a function of the errors in the NWP model fields modulated by the sensitivities of the sea ice concentration algorithm used. The NWP model fields representing the most significant atmospheric parameters, i.e. water vapour, cloud liquid water, surface temperature and wind speed over open water are evaluated using remote sensing data. For wind speed and total water vapour, it is found that the standard deviation of the difference is less than the RMS error quoted for the remote sensing algorithms. The best consistency is found for water vapour followed by wind speed. The NWP model cloud liquid water displays standard deviations much higher than the RMS error of the remote sensing algorithm and close to the total average content. Nine sea ice concentration algorithms are further evaluated in a sensitivity study to the above-mentioned atmospheric constituents using a detailed atmospheric radiative transfer model. The result shows that the class of algorithms based solely on the 19 and 37 GHz vertically polarised channels display the smallest sensitivity to all three atmospheric parameters: total water vapour, wind speed and cloud liquid water. Finally, it is demonstrated that this method overcomes many problems associated with conventional weather filtering over mixed ice-water and new-ice pixels and allows the retrieval of sea ice concentrations below 10%.

AB Estimation of aerosol loadings is of great importance to the studies on global climate changes. The current Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol estimation algorithm over land is based on the "dark-object" approach, which works only over densely vegetated ("dark") surfaces. In this study, we develop a new aerosol estimation algorithm that uses the temporal signatures from a sequence of MODIS imagery over land surfaces, particularly "bright" surfaces. The estimated aerosol optical depth is validated by Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements. Case studies indicate that this algorithm can retrieve aerosol optical depths reasonably well from the winter MODIS imagery at seven sites: four sites in the greater Washington, DC area, USA; Beijing City, China; Banizoumbou, Niger, Africa; and Bratts Lake, Canada. The MODIS aerosol estimation algorithm over land (MOD04), however, does not perform well over these non-vegetated surfaces. This new algorithm has the potential to be used for other satellite images that have similar temporal resolutions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Using simple models derived from spectral reflectance, we mapped the patterns of ecosystem CO2 and water fluxes in a semi-arid site in southern California during a period of extreme disturbance, marked by drought and fire. Employing a combination of low (similar to 2 km) and high (similar to 16 km) altitude images from the hyperspectral Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), acquired between April 2002 and September 2003, and ground data collected from an automated tram system, several vegetation indices were calculated for Sky Oaks field station, a FLUX-NET and SpecNet site located in northern San Diego County (CA, USA). Based on the relationships observed between the fluxes measured by the eddy covariance tower and the vegetation indices, net CO2 and water vapor flux maps were derived for the region around the flux tower. Despite differences in the scale of the images (from similar to 2 in to 16 m pixel size) as well as marked differences in environmental conditions (drought in 2002, recovery in early 2003, and fire in mid 2003), net CO2 and water flux modeled from AVIRIS-derived reflectance indices (NDVI, PRI and WBI) effectively tracked changes in tower fluxes across both drought and fire, and readily revealed spatial variation in fluxes within this landscape. After an initial period of net carbon uptake, drought and fire caused the ecosystem to lose carbon to the atmosphere during most of the study period. Our study shows the power of integrating optical and flux data in LUE models to better understand factors driving surface-atmosphere carbon and water vapor flux cycles, one of the main goals of SpecNet.

AB Small footprint LiDAR data were used to detect and characterize vegetation in a semi-arid sagebrush steppe environment in southeastern Idaho. Processing the raw data in individual flightlines maintained the high relative accuracy of the data set and allowed for the detection of sub-meter vegetation. First return LiDAR pulse data were used to both determine the ground surface as well as calculate vegetation heights. Surface roughness maps based on vegetation heights were found to best capture the variability of the canopy and accurately distinguish burned and unburned areas. Field validation of a sagebrush presence and absence classification based on a single roughness threshold value indicates an overall accuracy of 86%. The LiDAR-determined vegetation heights are moderately well correlated to those measured in the field, although the LiDAR heights uniformly underestimate the field heights. This underestimation is believed to be due to signal threshold limits within the LiDAR sensor, producing heights corresponding to the interior of the shrub canopy rather than the top.

AB A downscaling method for the near-surface soil moisture retrieved from passive microwave sensors is applied to the PBMR data collected during the Monsoon '90 experiment. The downscaling method requires (1) the coarse resolution microwave observations, (2) the fine-scale distribution of soil temperature and (3) the fine-scale distribution of surface conditions composed of atmospheric forcing and the parameters involved in the modeling of land surface-atmosphere interactions. During the Monsoon '90 experiment, eight ground-based meteorological and flux stations were operating over the 150km(2) study area simultaneously with the acquisition of the aircraft-based L-band PBMR data. The heterogeneous scene is hence composed of eight subpixels and the microwave pixel is generated by aggregating the microwave emission of all sites. The results indicate a good agreement between the downscaled and ground-based soil moisture as long as the intensity of solar radiation is sufficiently high to use the soil temperature as a tracer of the spatial variability of near-surface soil moisture.

AB Artificial neural networks (ANNs) may be of significant value in extracting vegetation type information in complex vegetation mapping problems, particularly in coastal wetland environments. Unsupervised, self-organizing ANNs have not been employed as frequently as supervised ANNs for vegetation mapping tasks, and further remote sensing research involving fuzzy ANNs is also needed. In this research, the utility of a fuzzy unsupervised ANN, specifically a fuzzy learning vector quantization (FLVQ) ANN, was investigated in the context of hyperspectral AVIRIS image classification. One key feature of the neural approach is that unlike conventional hyperspectral data processing methods, endmembers for a given scene, which can be difficult to deter-mine with confidence, are not required for neural analysis. The classification accuracy of FLVQ was comparable to a conventional supervised multi-layer perceptron, trained with backpropagation (MLP) (KHAT ((K) over cap) accuracy: 82.82% and 84.66%, respectively; normalized accuracy: 74.60% and 75.85%, respectively), with no significant difference at the 95% confidence level. All neural algorithms in the experiment yielded significantly higher classification accuracies than the conventional endmember-based hyperspectral mapping method assessed (i.e., matched filtering, where (K) over cap accuracy=61.00% and normalized accuracy= 57.96%). FLVQ was also dramatically more computationally efficient than the baseline supervised and unsupervised ANN algorithms tested, including the MLP and the Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM), respectively. The 400-neuron FLVQ network required only 3.6% of the computation time used by the MLP network, and only 5.9% of the MLP time was used by the 588-neuron FLVQ network. In addition, the 400-neuron FLVQ used only 16.7% of the time used by the 400-neuron SOM for model development. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Invasive nonindigenous plants are threatening the biological integrity of North American rangelands, as well as the economics that are supported by those ecosystems. Spatial information is critical to fulfilling invasive plant management strategies, Traditional invasive plant mapping has utilized ground-based hand or GPS mapping. The shortfalls of ground-based methods include the limited spatial extent covered and the associated time and cost. Mapping vegetation with remote sensing covers large spatial areas and maps can be updated at an interval determined by management needs. The objective of the study was to map leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) and spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa Lam.) using 128-band hyperspectral (5-m and 3-m resolution) imagery and assess the accuracy of the resulting maps. Beiman Cutler classifications (BCC) were used to classify the imagery using the randomForest package in the R statistical program. BCC builds multiple classification trees by repeatedly taking random subsets of the observational data and using random subsets of the spectral bands to determine each split in the classification trees. The resulting classification trees vote on the correct classification. Overall accuracy was 84% for the spotted knapweed classification, with class accuracies ranging from 60% to 93%; overall accuracy was 86 for the leafy spurge classification, with class accuracies ranging from 66% to 93%. Our results indicate that (1) BCC can achieve substantial improvements in accuracy over single classification trees with these data and (2) it might be unnecessary to have separate accuracy assessment data when using BCC, as the algorithm provides a reliable internal estimate of accuracy.

AB The urban heat-island effect occurs as a result of increased sensible beat flux from the land surface to the atmosphere near cities. Sensible heat flux consists of two components: exhausted anthropogenic heat, and heat radiation due to solar input. The latter may be enhanced by changes in the usage of artificial land surface. The authors have developed a new method to separate the anthropogenically discharged heat and natural heat radiation from the sensible heat flux, based on a heat-balance model using satellite remote sensing and ground meteorological data. This method was applied to ASTER and ETM+ data for the daytime during spring, summer and winter and for the nighttime during autumn in Nagoya, Japan. The increased sensible heat flux was approximately 100 W/m(2) in the central part of the city during the summer. Sensible heat flux at night during autumn was approximately 0 W/m(2), except in urban areas and over bodies of water. During the winter, anthropogenic heat accounted for almost all of the sensible heat flux in urban areas. The contribution of anthropogenic heat to sensible heat flux in spring was lower than the contributions in summer and winter. The anthropogenic heat flux was high in industrial areas throughout the year. These results are consistent with the fact that anthropogenic energy consumption is high in summer and winter and low in spring and autumn. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflectance Radiometer (ASTER) has three bands in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) with 15-m spatial resolution. The high spatial resolution has advantages for studying small aquatic areas, such as bay and lakes. Coastal areas are optically characterized by high concentrations of colored suspended matter, various phytoplankton pigments and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The color ratio bio-optical algorithms often used for open sea are very difficult to apply in optically complex coastal water, since it is assumed that the constituents of seawater are mainly phytoplankton pigments. The Neural Network (NN) method, which is one of inverse modeling, has the potential to estimate chlorophyll a, suspended matter and CDOM from remotely sensed data.
   In the present investigation, we implemented the NN method in the analysis of ASTER data of Tokyo Bay, as a case study in the coastal waters in order to demonstrate the usefulness of remote sensing with high spatial resolution. After validation of the NN using simulated data sets and a field data set observed from a ship, estimation of the concentration of TSS and Chl-a was reasonably accurate. However, in the case of CDOM, the result is not reliable. Disadvantages of the NN method are discussed in this paper. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a new algorithm for mapping evapotranspiration (ET) that requires only local weather-station data including the ground beat flux and high resolution airborne thermal imagery. This ET mapping algorithm (ETMA) is based on the surface energy budget and partitions the available energy between the latent and sensible heat fluxes. Two parameters T-latent and T-sensible are defined as the surface temperatures at which all of the turbulent heat flux is accounted for by the latent and sensible heat fluxes, respectively. These points are used to develop linear relationships between surface temperature and ET at specified times. Maps of ET at two times during the day are then used to model and integrate the diurnal pattern of ET using the Penman-Montieth and Jarvis-Stewart models of ET and surface resistance. The resulting maps of daily integrated ET have 1-m spatial resolution that is rarely available, yet important to the fields of hydrology, ecology, forestry, and agriculture. Our results comparing ET values to porometry-based local measurements within the meadows suggest that the mapped ETday values are accurate to within 10% of the potential ET rate or within 0.7 mm absolute error; however, under different conditions the error may be larger. The purpose of developing this algorithm was to investigate the hydroecology of restored and degraded meadows in the Sierra Nevada of northern California, USA. The pond-and-plug method of riparian restoration aims to raise the water table and re-establish native mesic vegetation that has been replaced by sagebrush and dryland species due to land-use practices over the past 150 years. By comparing the ET regime of two restored and two degraded meadows, we show that daily ET in the restored meadows (5-6.5 mm/day) was approximately twice that of the degraded ones (1.5-4 mm/day). The detailed images of ET show local impacts of land-use change and re-vegetation efforts. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We describe the production of a landform map of North Africa utilizing moderate resolution satellite imagery and a methodology that is applicable for sub-continental to global scale landform mapping. A mosaic of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) apparent surface reflectance imagery was compiled for Africa north of 10 degrees N. Landforrn image endmembers were chosen to characterize ten different types of vegetated and unvegetated desert surfaces: alluvial complexes, dunes, dry and ephemeral lakes, open water, basaltic volcanoes and flows, mountains, regs, stripped, low-angle bedrock surfaces, sand sheets, and Sahelian vegetation. Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was applied to the MODIS mosaic to estimate landform and vegetation endmember fractions. The major landform in each MODIS pixel was identified based on the majority endmember fraction in two- or three-endmember models. Accuracy assessment was conducted using two data sources: the historic Landform Map of North Africa [Raisz, E. (1952). Landform Map of North Africa. Environmental Protection Branch, Office of the Quartermaster General.] and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Comparison with the Raisz landform map gave an overall classification accuracy of 54% with significant confusion between alluvial surfaces and regs, and between sandy and clayey surfaces and dunes. A second validation using 20 Landsat images in a stratified sampling scheme gave a classification accuracy of 70%, with confusion between dunes and sand sheets. Both accuracy assessment schemes indicated difficulty in vegetation classification at the margin of the Sahel. A comparison with minimum distance and maximum likelihood supervised classifications found that the MESMA approach produced significantly higher classification accuracies. This digital landform map is of sufficiently high quality to form the basis for geomorphic studies, including parameterization of the surface in global and regional dust models.

AB The spatial distribution of very large trees in primary Amazon forest is studied with an indicative data set. Very large trees with height larger than 30 in are shown to be highly influential on forest structure, ecology and biomass regime. In particular, they account for a large portion of total above-ground biomass. Their spatial patterns are extracted from airborne SAR data, namely from a digital model- of interferometric forest height, by an approach of local maximum filtering. The spatial point patterns describing the distribution of very large trees in the forest within three sample blocks of 100 ha each are modeled by a series of Markov point process models. These models are fitted and assessed by standard spatial statistical methodology. Spatial distribution is regular, and interaction decreases with distance; very large trees are shown to exert repulsive interaction with their neighboring very large trees. The significance of these results for approaches of quantitative forest assessment in primary forests in the Brazilian Amazon is discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Previous studies of DMSP-OLS stable night lights have shown encouraging agreement between temporally stable lighted areas and various definitions of urban extent. However, these studies have also highlighted an inconsistent relationship between the actual lighted area and the boundaries of the urban areas considered. Applying detection frequency thresholds can reduce the spatial overextent of lighted area ("blooming") but thresholding also attenuates large numbers of smaller lights and significantly reduces the information content of the night lights datasets. Spatial analysis of the widely used 1994/1995 stable lights data and the newly released 1992/1993 and 2000 stable lights datasets quantifies the tradeoff between blooming and attenuation of smaller lights. For the 1992/1993 and 2000 datasets, a 14% detection threshold significantly reduces blooming around large settlements without attenuating many individual small settlements. The corresponding threshold for the 1994/1995 dataset is 10%. The size-frequency distributions of each dataset retain consistent shapes for increasing thresholds while the size-area distributions suggest a quasi-uniform distribution of lighted area with individual settlement size between 10 and 1000 kin equivalent diameter. Conurbations larger than 80 kin diameter account for < 1% of all settlements observed but account for about half the total lighted area worldwide. Area/perimeter distributions indicate that conurbations become increasingly dendritic as they grow larger. Comparison of lighted area with built area estimates from Landsat imagery of 17 cities shows that lighted areas are consistently larger than even maximum estimates of built areas for almost all cities in every light dataset. Thresholds > 90% can often reconcile lighted area with built area in the 1994/1995 dataset but there is not one threshold that works for a majority of the 17 cities considered. Even 100% thresholds significantly overestimate built area for the 1992/1993 and 2000 datasets. Comparison of lighted area with blooming extent for 10 lighted islands suggests a linear proportionality of 1.25 of lighted to built diameter and an additive bias of 2.7 kill. While more extensive analyses are needed, a linear relationship would be consistent with a physical model for atmospheric scattering combined with a random geolocation error. A Gaussian detection probability model is consistent with an observed sigmoid decrease of detection frequency for settlements < 10 km diameter. Taken together, these observations could provide the basis for a scale-dependent blooming correction procedure that simultaneously reduces geolocation error and scattering induced blooming.

ET is calculated based on the energy balance closure principle, The combination of evaporative fraction (EF), soil heat flux and instantaneous net radiation, results in an instantaneous spatial distribution of ET values, Surface broadband albedo and land surface temperature (LST) serve to determine EF. EF is derived using four methods based on NOAA/AVHRR satellite imagery. Instantaneous evapotranspiration, i.e. at time of satellite overpass, on European continental scale with emphasis on forest stands is estimated using the iNOAA-Chain, Finally, the estimated net radiation (R-n), soil heat fluxes (G(0)) and evaporative fraction and evapotranspiration at time of satellite overpass are validated against EUROFLUX site data for the growing season of 1997 (March-October). The regression line for the pooled R,, (iNOAA-Chain versus EUROFLUX) has a slope, intercept, Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (R-2) and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of respectively 0.943, 17.120, 0,926 and 5.5%, The soil heat fluxes, calculated with two approaches are not well modelled with slopes smaller than -3.000 and a R2 in the order of zero. We observe a slight underestimation of the NOAA-Chain estimated EF. The regression line for pooled EF data for the best performing method (SPLIT-method) has a slope of 0.935, an intercept of 0.041 and the R-2 is 0.847. A pooled RRMSE EF value of 12.3% is found. The pooled slope, intercept, R2 and RRMSE for EF derived with SORT-method 1 are respectively 0.449, 0.251, 0.043 and 65.1%, with SORT-method 2, 0.567, 0,203, 0.174 and 39.1%, and with SORT-method 3, 0.568, 0.254, 0.288, and 32.8%. Also instantaneous evapotranspiration is underestimated with a pooled RRMSE on ET of 23.4%. The regression curve of pooled ET data for the best performing method has a slope of 0.899 an intercept of 15.880 and a Pearson product moment correlation coefficient of 0.771. The other method gives a slope of 0.781, an intercept of 17.541 and a R2 of 0.776. Error propagation analysis reveals that the relative error on evapotranspiration at satellite overpass time is at least 27%. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Many large countries, including Canada, rely on earth observation as a practical and cost-effective means of monitoring their vast inland ecosystems. A potentially efficient approach is one that detects vegetation changes over a hierarchy of spatial scales ranging from coarse to fine. This paper presents a Change Screening Analysis Technique (Change-SAT) designed as a coarse filter to identify the location and timing of large (> 5-10 km(2)) forest cover changes caused by anthropogenic and natural disturbances at an annual, continental scale. The method uses change metrics derived from 1-km multi-temporal SPOT VEGETATION and NOAA AVHRR imagery (reflectance, temperature, and texture information) and ancillary spatial variables (proximity to active fires, roads, and forest tenures) in combination with logistic regression and decision tree classifiers. Major forest changes of interest include wildfires, insect defoliation, forest harvesting, and flooding. Change-SAT was tested for 1998-2000 using an independent sample of change and no-change sites over Canada. Overall accuracy was 94% and commission error, especially critical for large-area change applications, was less than 1%. Regions identified as having major or widespread changes could be targeted for more detailed investigation and mapping using field visits, aerial survey, or fine resolution EO methods, such as those being applied under Canadian monitoring programs. This multi-resolution approach could be used as part of a forest monitoring system to report on carbon stocks and forest stewardship. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Two remote sensing systems, which are considered to be operated in space, the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Water Vapour Lidar Experiment in Space (WALES) are compared with respect to their measurement methodologies and their performance. The focus is the retrieval of water vapor, which is determined by the inversion of the radiative transfer equation in case of IASI and by the differential absorption lidar (DIAL) technique in case of WALES. It is realized that different techniques and definitions for the specification of errors exist which are subject of confusion in the remote sensing community. After a clarification of this issue, a comparison of IASI and WALES water vapor retrievals is performed using the same water vapor climatologies and the same 2-d water vapor fields provided by a global numerical weather prediction (NWP) model.
   The methodologies and the capabilities of each instrument are compared in regions without clouds. Using end-to-end simulations for both instruments, which are to our knowledge performed for the first time, systematic errors are compared up to 16 km. It is found that the dependence of IASI retrievals on a variety of atmospheric parameters leads to compensating effects. Due to the multiwavelength retrieval, errors in the water vapor spectroscopy can partly cancel. The residual error is quantified by inversion of the radiative transfer equation in dependence of several atmospheric variables. In contrast, errors in water vapor DIAL are very sensitive to laser spectral properties as well as to the accuracy of water vapor spectroscopy, as single water vapor absorption lines are used for each vertical segment of the retrieval. As laser transmitters with excellent spectral specifications are feasible, this can still lead to very low systematic errors under all atmospheric conditions.
   Noise errors are determined using analytical models and are compared up to 16 km. At the same vertical (1-2 km) and horizontal (100-200 km) resolutions, respectively, the average noise errors in each profile are of the order of 10% for both methods. Depending on the climatology, the vertical range of IASI measurements is always several kilometers lower than that of DIAL. The performance of IASI degrades in dry atmospheres whereas the DIAL performance remains nearly independent of the climatology chosen. Bias errors show a similar behavior. Neglecting bias errors in the spectral measurements, from mid-latitudes to the tropics, IASI biases are < 2% in the vertical range where the noise errors remain < 20%. In the sub-arctic winter atmosphere, the bias increases to about -4% close to the ground. Space home DIAL bias profiles range between -2-1% under all conditions plus an additional height independent bias of about +/- 2 due to remaining uncertainties in absorption line spectroscopy.
   Operation in the region of clouds are not a focus of this publication but it is worth to mention that the results demonstrate that space home DIAL can perform measurements down to cloud tops and often through optically thin clouds. Particularly powerful is the synergistic combinations of both sensors in the future. Iteration between IASI temperature and DIAL water vapor retrievals will increase both accuracies.

AB Successful monitoring of ecologically significant, vulnerable fluvial systems will require improved quantitative techniques for mapping channel morphology and in-stream habitat. In this study, we assess the ability of remote sensing to contribute to these objectives by (1) describing the underlying radiative transfer processes, drawing upon research conducted in shallow marine environments; (2) modeling the effects of water depth, substrate type, suspended sediment concentration, and surface turbulence; (3) quantifying the limitations imposed by finite detector sensitivity and linear quantization; and (4) evaluating two depth retrieval algorithms using simulated and field-measured spectra and archival imagery. The degree to which variations in depth and substrate can be resolved depends on bottom albedo and water column optical properties, and scattering by suspended sediment obscures substrate spectral features and reduces the resolution of depth estimates. Converting continuous radiance signals to discrete digital numbers implies that depth estimates take the form of contour intervals that become wider as depth increases and as bottom albedo and detector sensitivity decrease. Our results indicate that a simple band ratio can provide an image-derived variable that is strongly linearly related to water depth across a broad range of stream conditions. This technique outperformed the linear transform method used in previous stream studies, most notably for upwelling radiance spectra [R-2=0.79 for the ln(560 nm/690 nm) ratio]. Applied to uncalibrated multispectral and hyperspectral images of a fourth-order stream in Yellowstone National Park, this flexible technique produced hydraulically reasonable maps of relative depth. Although radiometric precision and spatial resolution will impose fundamental limitations in practice, remote mapping of channel morphology and in-stream habitat is feasible and can become a powerful tool for scientists and managers.

AB This work presents a new algorithm designed to detect clouds in satellite visible and infrared (IR) imagery of ice sheets. The approach identifies possible cloud pixels through the use of the normalized difference snow index (NDSI). Possible cloud pixels are grown into regions and edges are determined. Possible cloud edges are then matched with possible cloud shadow regions using knowledge of the solar illumination azimuth. A scoring index quantifies the quality of each match resulting in a classified image. The best value of the NDSI threshold is shown to vary significantly, forcing the algorithm to be iterated through many threshold values. Computational efficiency is achieved by using sub-sampled images with only minor degradation in cloud-detection performance. The algorithm detects all clouds in each of eight test Landsat-7 images and makes no incorrect cloud classifications. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SEAWIFS
AB "Global" algorithms for satellite remote sensing do not always provide accurate retrievals in all areas of the ocean, particularly in coastal areas and high latitudes. Our current arctic algorithm shows that low chlorophyll concentrations ( similar to 0.6 mg m(-3)) are overestimated by the OC4V4 algorithm for Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), while higher concentrations common in blooms are underestimated almost twofold. Alternative algorithms or regionally tuned relationships can be used to produce more reliable chlorophyll retrievals; however, reprocessing of huge satellite data sets can be untenable. Several approaches were investigated to convert global products into regional values to improve accuracy while minimizing errors across the range of values. A simple, rapid transformation scheme employing linear interpolation circumvents reprocessing of entire data sets, but yields much more accurate regional values for the Arctic. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Satellite multi-sensor data is used to derive sensible heat flux (SHF), Bowen ratio (Bo), and thus latent heat flux (LHF) in the tropical Pacific. The temperature differences at the air-sea interface are determined empirically for regions where strong deep air convection is present due to the buoyancy force. The vertical airflow results in surface wind divergence, which is estimated from scatterometer wind vector fields. The areas of positive temperature differences between sea surface temperature and atmospheric temperature estimated using surface wind divergence and in situ measurements are highly consistent in the tropical Pacific, especially in two convergence zones, i.e., the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ). The bulk formulated SHF, determined by surface wind divergence (SHFBWD), is compared with a long-term time series (January 1993-December 1999) of the SHF from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalyzed model data (SHFM). In the ITCZ, the correlation coefficients and the Root Mean Square (RMS) differences between SHFBWD and SHFM are over 70% and in the order of less than 4 W/m(2), respectively. Furthermore, the bulk formulated latent heat flux (LHFB) is obtained using the empirical Bowen ratio (1300 and SHFBWD. The Bo(E) for the tropical Pacific was estimated using only sea surface temperature, which is valid when the vapor is saturated near sea surface. The RMS differences between SHFBWD and LHFB are estimated as 3.5 and 39.3 W/m(2), respectively. In addition, the differences of SHFBWD and LHFB during the boreal winters are smaller than that in the boreal summers. Finally, in order to study spatial and temporal variations, we apply Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis to SHFBWD and LHFB and compare with EOF analysis of Coupled Ocean and Atmosphere Data Set (COADS)'s SHF and LHF.

AB The dynamic nature of climate over Indian sub-continent is well known which influences Indian monsoon. Such dynamic variability of climate factors can also have significant implications for the vegetation and agricultural productivity of this region. Using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and wavelet decomposition techniques, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) monthly data over Indian sub-continent for 18 years from 1982 to 2000 have been used to study the variability of vegetation. The present study shows that the monsoon precipitation and land surface temperature over the Indian sub-continent landmass have significant impact on the distribution of vegetation. Tropospheric aerosols exert a strong influence too, albeit secondary to monsoon precipitation and prove to be a powerful governing factor. Local climate anomaly is seen to be more effective in determining the vegetation change than any global teleconnection effects. The study documents the dominating influence of monsoon precipitation and highlights the importance of aerosols on the vegetation and necessitates the need for remedial measures. The present study and an earlier one point towards a possible global teleconnection pattern of ENSO as it is seen to affect a particular mode of vegetation worldwide. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB This note investigates the structure of two data sets of highly resolved directional-reflectance of vegetation canopies, obtained with a spectroradiometer mounted on a goniometer. One canopy was a grass lawn (largely erectophile) and the other was of watercress (largely planophile). The data sets consist of radiance measurements in 356 spectral bands in visible and near-infrared wavelengths, and in either 61 or 358 different directions, but avoiding directions very close to the hot-spot. The singular value decompositions of the two-dimensional data sets are used to investigate their intrinsic dimensionality, and so also the redundancy contained in the data. A single directional function and a single spectral function together fit the data quite well in a least squares sense, with the root mean square residual amounting to one part in a hundred of the total sum of squares of the data. However, the residuals indicate that one or two further pairs of functions are needed to characterize the systematic variation of spectral reflectance with direction (or equivalently, of the angular reflectance distribution with wavelength). Three such pairs of functions are found to fit the data to better than one part in a thousand, with the residuals then showing no systematic structure. The consequences for atmospheric correction of multi-view remote sensing data are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing of urban heat islands (UHIs) has traditionally used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the indicator of vegetation abundance to estimate the land surface temperature (LST)-vegetation relationship. This study investigates the applicability of vegetation fraction derived from a spectral mixture model as an alternative indicator of vegetation abundance. This is based on examination of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of Indianapolis City, IN, U M, acquired on June 22, 2002. The transformed ETM+ image was unmixed into three fraction images (green vegetation, dry soil, and shade) with a constrained least-square solution. These fraction images were then used for land cover classification based on a hybrid classification procedure that combined maximum likelihood and decision tree algorithms. Results demonstrate that LST possessed a slightly stronger negative correlation with the unmixed vegetation fraction than with NDVI for all land cover types across the spatial resolution (30 to 960 m). Correlations reached their strongest at the 120-m resolution, which is believed to be the operational scale of LST, NDVI, and vegetation fraction images. Fractal analysis of image texture shows that the complexity of these images increased initially with pixel aggregation and peaked around 120 m, but decreased with further aggregation. The spatial variability of texture in LST was positively correlated with those in NDVI and in vegetation fraction. The interplay between thermal and vegetation dynamics in the context of different land cover types leads to the variations in spectral radiance and texture in LST. These variations are also present in the other imagery, and are responsible for the spatial patterns of urban heat islands. It is suggested that the areal measure of vegetation abundance by unmixed vegetation fraction has a more direct correspondence with the radiative, thennal, and moisture properties of the Earth's surface that determine LST.

AB The MODIS land science team produces a number of standard products, including land cover and leaf area index (LAI). Critical to the success of MODIS and other sensor products is an independent evaluation of product quality. In that context, we describe a study using field data and Landsat ETM+ to map land cover and LAI at four 49-km(2) sites in North America containing agricultural cropland (AGRO), prairie grassland (KONZ), boreal needleleaf forest, and temperate mixed forest. The purpose was to: (1) develop accurate maps of land cover, based on the MODIS IGBP (International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme) land cover classification scheme; (2) derive continuous surfaces of LAI that capture the mean and variability of the LAI field measurements; and (3) conduct initial MODIS validation exercises to assess the quality of early (i.e., provisional) MODIS products. ETM+ land cover maps varied in overall accuracy from 81% to 95%. The boreal forest was the most spatially complex, had the greatest number of classes, and the lowest accuracy. The intensive agricultural cropland had the simplest spatial structure, the least number of classes, and the highest overall accuracy. At each site, mapped LAI patterns generally followed patterns of land cover across the site. Predicted versus observed LAI indicated a high degree of correspondence between field-based measures and ETM+ predictions of LAI. Direct comparisons of ETM+ land cover maps with Collection 3 MODIS cover maps revealed several important distinctions and similarities. One obvious difference was associated with image/map resolution. ETM+ captured much of the spatial complexity of land cover at the sites. In contrast, the relatively coarse resolution of MODIS did not allow for that level of spatial detail. Over the extent of all sites, the greatest difference was an overprediction by MODIS of evergreen needleleaf forest cover at the boreal forest site, which consisted largely of open shrubland, woody savanna, and savanna. At the agricultural, temperate mixed forest, and prairie grassland sites, ETM+ and MODIS cover estimates were similar. Collection 3 MODIS-based LAI estimates were considerably higher (up to 4 m(2) m(-2)) than those based on ETM+ LAI at each site. There are numerous probable reasons for this, the most important being the algorithms' sensitivity to MODIS reflectance calibration, its use of a prelaunch AVHRR-based land cover map, and its apparent reliance on mainly red and near-IR reflectance. Samples of Collection 4 LAI products were examined and found to consist of significantly improved LAI predictions for KONZ, and to some extent for AGRO, but not for the other two sites. In this study, we demonstrate that MODIS reflectance data are highly correlated with LAI across three study sites, with relationships increasing in strength from 500 to 1000 in spatial resolution, when shortwave-infrared bands are included.

AB On 27th October 2002, after 15 months of small activity, the Mount Etna located on the island of Sicily, Italy (37.73degreesN, 15.00degreesE) erupted undergoing one of its most vigorous eruptions in years. During a few days, Europe's highest and most active volcano hurled lava and spewed significant amounts of ash and trace gases into the atmosphere. The smoke and ash plume originating from the volcano stretched from the Sicily to the north African coast.
   The plume from the volcano has been identified and tracked using half-hourly Meteosat-7 visible, infrared, and water vapor imagery in order to estimate the radiative forcing produced by the introduction of the volcanic cloud in a previously clear sky. Our results indicate that, while the volcanic cloud has introduced a well-discernable radiative perturbation, the magnitude of the shortwave volcanic forcing appears in the range of the one introduced by large clouds above the Mediterranean Sea. By contrast, the perturbation generated in the longwave spectrum at the top of the atmosphere is larger than the one introduced by large meteorological clouds. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB The capability of NASA radar altimeter Topex for land surface studies at regional or global scale is investigated. The analyzed data, available since mid-1992 consist of dual-frequency backscattering coefficients values (Ku and C band) estimated at the nadir pointing angle along the satellite tracks between 66degreesS and 66degreesN and averaged in 0.75degrees ground resolution cell. Mean global backscatter images of the entire land surfaces are presented in Ku, C band and the difference C-Ku. Statistics and major temporal signals over nine entire years are also presented at a global scale. Finally, temporal profiles of backscatters are extracted for main land types (desert, tropical forest, wet and dry savanna, boreal regions, ice sheet) to validate the dataset and to analyze radar response to land surface variability through 9 years. Results indicate the high capabilities of Topex-Poseidon (T-P) radar altimeter data for monitoring snow-covered regions at global and regional scale. The use of dual-frequency measurements can also improve methods developed with single frequency radar altimeter over complex vegetated areas. The complementarities for future synergy with wind-scatterometer or satellite imagery data over continents look also promising because of the T-P 10-day repeat cycle, a 10-year span dataset and a future better spatial resolution with combination of other dual-frequency altimetry missions such as ENVISAT or Jason.

AB In this paper, a reflectance-based method is proposed to accurately quantify percent grass cover from TM data for a semiarid grassland in western China. In situ measured percent grass cover was sampled over I in 2 plots at 68 sites. Their ground coordinates were logged with a global positioning system (GPS) receiver and their spectral reflectance measured with a spectrometer. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was derived from both in situ measured spectral reflectance and radiometrically calibrated Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) bands 3 and 4. It was found that the NDVI derived from in situ measured spectral reflectance was closely correlated with percent grass cover (R-2 = 0.74), but not with its counterpart derived from the satellite image. After standardization of the latter with the former, the TM-derived NDVI bore a close regression relationship with the in situ measured samples (R-2 = 0.74). This relationship enabled the successful quantification of grass cover from the satellite image at an overall accuracy of 89%. This reflectance-based method can be used to reliably quantify grass cover from TM imagery. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SURFACE ALBEDO; MELT PONDS; PARAMETERIZATION; DEPTH
AB The development of melt ponds on Arctic sea ice during spring and summer is of great importance to the Arctic climate system as it accelerates the decay of the sea ice and greatly reduces the albedo. Both melt pond development and its spatial distribution are needed to understand the surface energy balance in summer. Previously, a technique was developed for classifying summer sea ice characteristics, including the amount of open water, white (snow-covered) ice, wet ice, and melt ponds using Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) spectral information. In this paper, we refine this technique through the use of airborne video data coincident with Landsat ETM+ imagery obtained over Baffin Bay on June 27, 2000. The video images, having a resolution of about 1.5 m at an aircraft altitude of 1.4 km, are classified into open water, ponded or wet ice, and unponded sea ice. Comparison of the video and Landsat imagery shows that many of the melt ponds are too small to cover an entire Landsat pixel (resolution of 30 in) so that the Landsat classification scheme would underestimate melt pond fraction. Thirteen high-resolution video images are classified to develop a method to calculate fractions of open water, ponded or wet ice, and unponded ice from Landsat 7 data. A comparison between these classified video images and Landsat retrievals yields a correlation coefficient of 0.95 with rms errors of less than 9% for the two ice types and 2% for open water. Comparisons of Landsat and video analyses not used in the development of the algorithm yield correlation coefficients of 0.87 for open water, 0.68 for ponded ice, and 0.78 for unponded ice. The rms differences are 10%, 8%, and 11 %, respectively. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Methods for using airborne laser scanning (also called airborne LIDAR) to retrieve forest parameters that are critical for fire behavior modeling are presented. A model for the automatic extraction of forest information is demonstrated to provide spatial coverage of the study area, making it possible to produce 3-D inputs to improve fire behavior models.
   The Toposys I airborne laser system recorded the last return of each footprint (0.30-0.38 m) over a 2000 in by 190 m flight line. Raw data were transformed into height above the surface, eliminating the effect of terrain on vegetation height and allowing separation of ground surface and crown heights. Data were defined as ground elevation if heights were less than 0.6 m. A cluster analysis was used to discriminate crown base height, allowing identification of both tree and understory canopy heights. Tree height was defined as the 99 percentile of the tree crown height group, while crown base height was the I percentile of the tree crown height group. Tree cover (TC) was estimated from the fraction of total tree laser hits relative to the total number of laser hits. Surface canopy (SC) height was computed as the 99 percentile of the surface canopy group. Surface canopy cover is equal to the fraction of total surface canopy hits relative to the total number of hits, once the canopy height profile (CHP) was corrected. Crown bulk density (CBD) was obtained from foliage biomass (FB) estimate and crown volume (CV), using an empirical equation for foliage biomass. Crown volume was estimated as the crown area times the crown height after a correction for mean canopy cover. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Water masses of different temperature and salinity partially govern the distributions of chlorophyll concentration. In the present paper, chlorophyll concentration has been deduced over the northeastern Arabian Sea and the southern Bay of Bengal using Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) data onboard Indian Remote Sensing Series Polar satellite (IRS-P4). The chlorophyll concentration is found to be higher in the northeastern Arabian Sea compared to those in the southern Bay of Bengal. The higher chlorophyll concentration is found during the northeast monsoon compared to those during the pre- and post-monsoon period and also in the coastal water compared to the open ocean. Higher spatial and seasonal chlorophyll distributions in the northeastern Arabian Sea compared to the southern Bay of Bengal is attributed to the shallow depth of the shelf in the Arabian Sea.

AB A small set of independent variables generally seems to suffice when attempting to describe the spectral response of a vegetation canopy to incident solar radiation. This set includes the soil reflectance, the single-scattering albedo, canopy transmittance, reflectance and interception, the portion of uncollided radiation in the total incident radiation, and portions of collided canopy transmittance and interception. All of these are measurable; they satisfy a simple system of equations and constitute a set that fully describes the law of energy conservation in vegetation canopies at any wavelength in the visible and near-infrared part of the solar spectrum. Further, the system of equations specifies the relationship between the optical properties at the leaf and the canopy scales. Thus, the information content of hyperspectral data can be fully exploited if these variables can be retrieved, for they can be more directly related to some of the physical properties of the canopy (e.g. leaf area index). This paper demonstrates this concept through retrievals of single-scattering albedo, canopy absorptance, portions of uncollided and collided canopy transmittance, and interception from hyperspectral data collected during a field campaign in Ruokolahti, Finland, June 14-21, 2000. The retrieved variables are then used to estimate canopy leaf area index, vegetation ground cover, and also the ratio of direct to total incident solar radiation at blue, green, red, and near-infrared spectral intervals.

AB Mixture analysis is a necessary component for capturing sub-pixel heterogeneity in the characterization of land cover from remotely sensed images. Mixture analysis approaches in remote sensing vary from conventional linear mixture models to nonlinear neural network mixture models. Linear mixture models are fairly simple and generally result in poor mixture analysis accuracy. Neural network models can achieve much higher accuracy, but typically lack interpretability. In this paper we present a mixture discriminant analysis (MDA) model for inferring land cover fractions within forest stands from Landsat Thematic Mapper images. Specifically, individual class distributions are modeled as mixtures of subclasses of Gaussian distributions, and land cover fractions are estimated using the corresponding posterior probabilities. Compared to a benchmark study on accuracy of mixture models with Plumas National Forest data, this MDA model easily outperforms traditional linear mixture models and parallels the performance of the ARTMAP neural network mixture model. In other words, the MDA model is observed to successfully combine the performance characteristics of more complex neural network models (due to the nonlinear nature of its classification rules), with the ease of interpretation associated with linear mixture models (due to its relatively simple structure). MDA models therefore offer an attractive alternative for addressing the mixture modeling problem in remote sensing. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Correction
AB This paper presents simulation results of the backscattering coefficient, in order to discriminate between wet snow and dry snow covers sensed at 5.3 GHz by the RADARSAT Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor. Snow-field measurements coinciding with the RADARSAT SAR overpasses are used to explore and set out optimal conditions for wet snow detection, as a function of the sensor incidence angles. The conditions concern wet snow surface characteristics, mainly the roughness represented by the surface slope m and the volumetric liquid water content, snwc (vol.%). Based on the 3-dB threshold value used in several wet snow detection algorithms, the results show that in order to be discriminated from dry snow covers, wet snow surfaces must be characterized as: (a) m less than or equal to 0.058 and snwc greater than or equal to 1.1, if the sensor operates in the S1 mode (20-27degrees incidence angle range), and (b) m less than or equal to 0.082 and snwc greater than or equal to 3.0, if the observations are made in the S7 mode (45-49degrees incidence angle range). For the identification of a very wet snow, it is also shown that the S7 mode of RADARSAT SAR sensor is more suitable than the S 1 mode. The latter, however, provides better discrimination for low values of the snow liquid water content. Furthermore, for wet snow detection based on modeling, the present paper demonstrates the importance of using the appropriate methodology to assess the dielectric constant of the background medium.

AB Satellite observations play an important role in characterization of the interannual variation of vegetation. Here, we report anomalies of two vegetation indices for Northern Asia (40degreesN-75degreesN, and 45degreesE-179degreesE), using images from the SPOT-4 VEGETATION (VGT) sensor over the period of April 1, 1998 to November 20, 2001. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which are correlated to a number of vegetation properties (e.g., net primary production, leaf area index), were compared. The results show that there is a large disagreement between NDVI and EVI anomalies in 1998 and 1999 for Northern Asia. The NDVI anomaly in 1998 was largely affected by atmospheric contamination, predominantly aerosols from extensive forest fires in that year. The EVI anomaly in 1998 was less sensitive to residual atmospheric contamination, as it is designed to be, and thus EVI is a useful alternative vegetation index for the large-scale study of vegetation. The EVI anomaly also suggests that potential vegetation productivity in Northern Asia was highest in 1998 but declined substantially in 2001, consistent with precipitation data from 1998-2001.

AB Satellite scatterometer winds over the northwestern Pacific were analyzed with the vector empirical orthogonal function (VEOF) method. The Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), a newly developed non-linear and non-stationary time series data processing method, was also employed in the analysis. A combination of European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS) - 1/2 scatterometer, NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) and NASA's Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) winds covering the period from January 1992 to April 2000 and the area of 0-50degreesN, 100-148degreesE constitutes the baseline for this study. The results indicate that annual cycles dominate the two leading VEOF modes. The first VEOF shows the East Asian monsoon features and the second represents a spring-autumn oscillation. We removed the annual signal from the data set and calculated the interannual VEOFs. The first interannual VEOF represents the interannual variability existing in the spring-autumn oscillation. The temporal mode is correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index (Sol), but has a half-year lag with respect to the SOI. The spatial mode of the first interannual VEOF reflects the response of the tropical and extratropical winds to ENSO events. The second interannual VEOF is another ENSO related mode, and the temporal VEOF mode is correlated with the SOI with a correlation coefficient of 0.78, revealing the wind variability over mid-latitudes, which is associated with ENSO events. Further analysis indicated that the wind variability over the coast of East Asia represents anomalies of a Hadley cell. The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) was found in the temporal mode, indicating and verifying that the QBO in the wind fields is related to ENSO events. The third VEOF shows the interannaul variability in the winter-summer mode and displays the interannual variability of the East Asian monsoon. The three leading interannual VEOFs are statistically meaningful as confirmed by a significance test. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID NEAR-INFRARED REFLECTANCE; SPECTRA
AB The objective of this study was to explore the relationship between soil reflectance in the solar domain (400-2500 nm) and soil moisture. Ten soils covering a large range of composition have been sampled. To decrease the large dimensionality of the data set, we reduced the number of wavebands investigated thanks to a simple stepwise linear regression. Seven wavebands were selected, which represent the whole spectral domain for the 10 soils and all moisture conditions with a root mean square error (RMSE) better than 0.002, close to the experimental uncertainties. Each soil reflectance spectrum was normalized by the corresponding reflectance spectrum observed under the driest condition. This allows to minimize effects due to soil type, as well as those of other undesirable multiplicative factors such as roughness and measurement configuration. The relationship between the normalized soil reflectance and moisture was then investigated. For all the wavelengths and all the soils, results show that for low soil moisture levels, the reflectance decreased when the moisture increased. Conversely, after a critical point, soil reflectance increased with soil moisture. For some soils, the reflectance of the wettest conditions can overpass that of the driest conditions. The position of the critical point was related to soil hydrodynamic properties. For both low and high soil moisture levels, and the seven wavelengths selected, the relative reflectance was strongly correlated with moisture. Adjustment of the relationships over individual soil types provides better soil moisture retrieval performances. It also shows that the relationships are generally nonlinear. These results are discussed with regards to the underlying physical processes, as well as for application to soil moisture estimates from reflectance measurements. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The characteristics of calibration and validation data, especially sample size, distribution, thematic labeling, and representativeness, are important to supervised classification algorithms, as are their use to ascribe accuracy statements to supervised classification results. While random and stratified random sampling of calibration and validation into calibration (training) and validation (testing) subsets has often been based on pixel sampling, the resulting accuracy statements may be overly optimistic and biased due to spatial autocorrelation. This is especially true for decision tree and neural network algorithms that tend to learn examples well even when just a single pixel from a site is presented in the learning phase. Therefore, polygon- or site-based sampling (using groups of contiguous pixels) for calibration and validation may provide better estimates of prediction accuracies. This paper presents the results of pixel- versus polygon-based calibration and validation of a supervised Gaussian ARTMAP neural network algorithm. Both techniques were applied to (1) a multitemporal AVHRR vegetation index data set and (2) a multitemporal data set of NDVI, temperature, and additional temporal metric and physical data to map vegetation and land cover (VLC) based on a regional network of sites in Central America. Our results indicate that although pixel-based accuracy assessment because of spatial autocorrelation may overstate accuracy, polygon-based assessments are also problematic. The Gaussian ARTMAP algorithm was used to provide insight into the problems of site heterogeneity, per-class accuracy, sampling rate, sampling representativeness, and the generalization properties of sites and classes, as related to pixel- and polygon-based sampling.

AB This investigation aims at quantifying the various sources of uncertainties in the derivation of albedo products from geo-stationary and polar orbiting optical systems with emphasis on the sensor and surface type (soil, snow, vegetation) spectral characteristics, atmospheric condition, and angular sampling issues. This research specifically takes into account the uncertainties in albedo that we can expect due to the synergistic use of the European Polar System (EPS)/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)/Scanning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) instruments data. Satellite orbital models and a Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves (SAIL)-hotspot canopy radiative transfer model were used to simulate synthetic bidirectional reflectance data sets for a broad range of vegetation canopies. The surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) database derived from the Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance (POLDER) data was used in support of the simulations. Spectral atmospheric effects were generated using the 6S atmospheric radiative transfer code. Linear BRDF models, which are candidates for operational use, were inverted with the synthetic reflectance data sets of MSG, AVHRR and MSG-AVHRR combined. The BRDF parameters were then used to derive albedo by hemispherical angular integration. The retrieved model coefficients are discussed with regard to angular sampling and the implications these yield on spectral and broadband albedo determinations. It appears that the sampling problem is better conditioned thanks to the synergistic nature of MSG and AVHRR data. This synergy contributed to enhanced albedo retrievals, but can introduce larger uncertainties due to issues related to the differences in spectral bands and atmospheric state. Hence, the quality of the operational albedo products derived from one or More sources of satellite data will depend to a large extent on sensor characteristics (spectral, radiometric, and geometric), cloud detection, atmospheric correction, the angular distribution of the observations, and finally, the narrow-to-broadband albedo conversion.

AB The potential of canopy reflectance distributions in the hotspot region for characterizing leaf geometry (leaf size and shape) of grass and crop canopies is explored with computer simulations. In this article, a computer graphics method-Lindenmayer-systems (L-systems) - is used to render a series of leaf (grass) and architecturally realistic row-planted crop (corn-like) canopies that have a variety of geometrical structures. A radiosity-graphics combined model is then employed to calculate the radiation regime in a canopy, including canopy directional reflectance. An effectiveness ratio (E ratio) is proposed, which is able to evaluate the performance of a given measure or index in estimation of the parameter of interest under the influence of a number of "noise" factors (other geometric and optical parameters of the canopy) at various noise levels. This E ratio is then applied to evaluate reflectance and normalized reflectance in the hotspot region for leaf geometry characterization. The result from simulated hotspot reflectance demonstrates that for both canopies, leaf geometry is estimable by using normalized reflectance within +/-4-8degrees (or +/-2-4degrees) around the hotspot direction in the principal cone (or principal plane). However, the center position and angular width of the optimal sampling region are affected by the number of noise factors [such as leaf area index, leaf angle distribution for leaf canopies, plus row structure for row-plant crop canopies] and their variation ranges. In most cases, normalized spectral reflectance in the near-infrared at a high solar zenith angle in the PC produces the most reliable results. The reason for better estimation of leaf geometry for grass and crop canopies than forests from hotspot observations is also discussed in this article. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Surface climatic conditions are key determinants of arthropod vector distribution and abundance and consequently affect transmission rates of any diseases they may carry. Remotely sensed observations by satellite sensors are the only feasible means of obtaining regional- and continental-scale measurements of climate at regular intervals for real-time epidemiological applications, such as disease early warning systems. The potential of Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL) data to provide surrogate variables for near-surface air temperature (T-a) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) over Africa and Europe was assessed in this context. For the years 1988- 1990 and 1992, correlations were examined between meteorological ground measurements (monthly mean T-a and VPDgrd) and variables derived from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data [land surface temperature (LST) and VPDsat]. The AVHRR indices were derived from both daily and composite PAL data so that their relative performance could be determined. Furthermore, the ground observations were divided into African and European subsets, so that the relative performance of the satellite data at tropical/subtropical and temperate latitudes could be assessed. Significant correlations were shown between T-a and LST in all months. Temporal variability existed in the strength of correlations throughout any 12-month period, with the pattern of variability consistent between years. The adjusted r(2) values increased when elevation and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were included, in addition to LST as predictor variables of T-a. Attempts to derive monthly estimates of atmospheric moisture availability resulted in an overestimation of VPDsat compared to ground observations, VPDgrd,. The use of daily PAL data to derive monthly mean climatic indices was shown to be more accurate than those obtained using monthly maximum values from 10-day composite data. A subset of the 1992 data was then used to build linear regression models for the direct retrieval of monthly mean T-a from PAL data. The accuracy of retrieved estimates was greatest when NDVI was included with LST as predictor variables, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) varying from 1.83degreesC to 3.18degreesC with a mean of 2.38degreesC over the 12-month period.

ID RESOLUTION; ECOSYSTEMS; DATABASE
AB Landsat-7 science mission requires large-area analysis of land to cover to quantify anthropogenic and natural changes in Earth's terrestrial environment. Such a goal involves processing (and reprocessing) thousands of Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes, but current analysis methodologies that rely on "handcrafting" individual scenes cannot scale to this data flow. As an alternative, we have constructed a prototype computer system, REALM (Research Environment for Advanced Landsat Monitoring), to automate preprocessing and analysis of large volume of Landsat imagery. Users can submit arbitrary algorithms to the database using a query language to generate science results "on the fly." The current prototype, running on a cluster of Linux-based PCs, has created a preliminary forest-cover map for the northeastern US from 9 GB of ETM+ data in just 25 min, for an aggregate throughput of 6 MB/s. The exercise demonstrates the processing Landsat data over very large areas is now feasible. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

TI Characteristics of atmospheric forcing and SST cooling events in the
   Gulf of Mannar during winter monsoon
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID OCEAN
AB This work addresses the analysis of winter monsoon forcing and sea surface temperature (SST) cooling events in the Gulf of Mannar, which is situated between the southeast of the Indian tip and northwest of Sri Lanka, using a 7-year data set derived from satellite sensors. The surface forcing consists of wind stress and turbulent heat flux, which were estimated through the TOGA/COARE algorithm using Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) wind, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) SST, and surface atmospheric conditions derived from National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalyses data. Net heat flux was derived by combining the turbulent heat flux with net short- and long-wave radiation from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data set. SST cooling was monitored by using 9-km spatial resolution pathfinder SST that was derived from the AVHRR. The 7-year weekly mean maps of wind stress, net heat flux, and SST indicate that SST cooling is locally influenced by surface forcing in- and offshore of the Gulf of Mannar. A time series of these parameters near the Indian tip reveal that the strong wind stress and high surface heat loss, which are punctuated in time varying from 15 days to more than a month, occur every winter and lower SST by similar to1.5 degreesC. The occurrence of such a phenomenon is referred to as an event in this work. The bell-shaped events, which have a periodicity, of 15 days with a maximum wind stress around Day 8, occur every winter and are characterized by the SST cooling of less than a degree. The features of these events are studied by using the statistical correlation and composite technique. It is inferred that the SST cooling is strongly correlated with the surface forcing.

AB One objective of the MultiResolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium is to map general land-cover categories for the conterminous United States using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Land-cover mapping and classification accuracy assessment are complete for the eastern United States. The accuracy assessment was based on photo-interpreted reference data obtained from a stratified probability sample of pixels. Agreement was defined as a match between primary or alternate reference Land-cover labels assigned to each sample pixel and the mode (most common class) of the map's land-cover labels within a 3 x 3-pixel neighborhood surrounding the sampled point. At 30-m resolution, overall accuracy was 59.7% at an Anderson Level II thematic detail, and 80.5% at Anderson Level I. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

ID EMISSION; SENSITIVITY
AB The performance of single-channel, two-channel, and six-channel microwave radiometers is evaluated for the retrieval of soil moisture using parameterized numerical simulations. Commonly used frequencies of 1.4 GHz, 2.7 GHz, and 6.6 GHz at vertical and/or horizontal linear polarizations are considered. The best single-channel retrieval uses 1.4 GHz at vertical polarization (1.4 V). This channel is least sensitive to variable surface roughness and vegetation canopy, but all single-channel sensors, including 1.4 V, are degraded without some level of a priori information about these masking variables. The sensitivity to surface roughness is reduced significantly at 2.7 GHz and 6.6 GHz by increasing the angle of incidence beyond 25 degrees. The best two-channel case uses 1.4 V and 2.7 H to simultaneously retrieve both soil moisture and surface roughness. This improves the soil moisture retrieval and eliminates the need for a priori information about surface roughness. The sensitivity to variations in vegetation canopy is also acceptably small. Simultaneous use of all six channels to retrieve soil moisture, surface roughness, and vegetation canopy provides only marginal improvement over the best two-channel performance. The small amount of additional information contained in the other four channels is largely masked by typical levels of measurement noise. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.

AB Remote sensing is an efficient means of obtaining large-area land-cover data. Yet, remotely sensed data are not error-free. This paper presents a geostatistical method to model spatial uncertainty in estimates of the areal extent of land-cover types. The area estimates are based on exhaustive but uncertain (soft) remotely sensed data and a sample of reference (hard) data. The method requires a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive land-cover classes. Land-cover regions should be larger than the pixels' ground resolution cells. Using sequential indicator simulation, a set of equally probable maps are generated from which uncertainties regarding land-cover patterns are inferred. Collocated indicator cokriging, the geostatistical estimation method employed, explicitly accounts for the spatial cross-correlation between hard and soft data using a simplified model of coregionalization. The method is illustrated using a case study from southern Spain. Demonstrated uncertainties concern the areal extent of a contiguous olive region and the proportion of olive vegetation within large pixel blocks. As the image-derived olive data were not very informative, conditioning on hard data had a considerable effect on the area estimates and their uncertainties. For example, the expected areal extent of the contiguous olive region increased from 65 ha to 217 ha when conditioning on the reference sample. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB A stochastic radiative transfer equation for the mean field and its solution for the case of discontinuous vegetation canopies is discussed in this article. The equation set satisfies the law of energy conservation and is amenable to numerical solution by the method of successive orders of scattering approximations. Special attention is given to analytical analysis of the effect of spatial discontinuity on the radiation field. Research indicates that a complete description of the radiation field in discontinuous media is possible, using not only average values of radiation over total space but averages over space occupied by absorbing elements is also required. A new formula for absorbtance, which extends the formula for a homogeneous case, was obtained for the general case of discontinuous media. The internal as well as the emergent radiation fields were validated using available radiative transfer models (one- and three-dimensional) and Monte Carlo model of computer-generated maize canopy. Additionally, the canopy reflectance simulation is assessed by comparisons with field data from shrublands. In all cases, the simulations compare well with both the Monte Carlo results and the field data. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB This paper discusses the potential of an L-band 2-D microwave interferometric radiometer for monitoring surface variables over land surfaces. The instrument is the payload of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Mission recently selected for phase A studies by the European Space Agency (ESA) as the second Earth Explorer Opportunity Mission. The L-band radiometer is based on an innovative two-dimensional aperture synthesis concept. This sensor has new and significant capabilities, especially in terms of multiangular viewing configurations. The main aspects of the retrieval capabilities of SMOS for monitoring soil moisture, vegetation biomass, and surface temperature are presented in this paper. The analysis is based on model inversion. The standard errors of estimate of the surface variables are computed for variations configurations as a function of both the uncertainties associated with the space measurements and those associated with the ancillary information used in the retrievals. The potential of SMOS and the possibility to retrieve one, two, or three surface variables are investigated, depending on the view angle configuration. These questions are key issues to optimize the SMOS mission scenario to meet both the scientific requirements and the technical constraints of the mission. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

AB An empirical orthogonal function analysis of an advanced very high resolution radiometer sea surface temperature data set encompassing the spring-summer period during 1991-1993 was used to examine patterns of temperature variability off northern and central California. This analysis decomposed the spatial variability of remotely sensed sea surface temperature in 124 images that covered an offshore distance of 200 km and an alongshore distance of 500 km. The first mode empirical orthogonal function described 65% of the spatial variability in the data set. The spatial amplitude patter of the first mode, which closely resembled the mean of all the images, revealed a strong cross-shore gradient with much cooler water nearshore and warmer water offshore. These areas of cool waters were associated with known upwelling locales, and the large-scale temperature structure compared favorably to that derived from historical California Cooperative Oceanographic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI) climatology. The mode 1 temporal amplitude function, representing the temporal modulation of this spatial patter, was coupled with changes in the alongshore component of the coastal wind field. Interannual variations in the timing of the spring transition were reflected in this temporal amplitude time series. The second mode empirical orthogonal function described 11% of the variability in the data set. The spatial pattern revealed a north-south structure that appeared to be related to regional spatial variations in the strength of upwelling-favorable wind. The third empirical orthogonal function described only 3% of the data variability and the spatial structure suggested a meandering of the coastal surface flow. The results of this investigation indicate that the empirical orthogonal function method was effective at characterizing front the satellite data the dominant nearshore surface properties of die California Current System related to upwelling and rc;ind and by extension suggest that it is a suitable approach for remotely investigating other less well known easter boundary current systems.

ID BACKGROUNDS; CANOPIES; RESIDUE
AB The presence of plant litter on the soil surface influences the flow of nutrients, carbon, water, and energy in terrestrial ecosystems. Quantifying plant litter cover is important for interpreting vegetated landscapes and for evaluating the effectiveness of conservation tillage practices. Current methods of measuring litter cover are subjective, requiring considerable visual judgment. Reliable and objective methods are needed. The spectral reflectance (0.4-2.5 mu m) of wet and dry soils (six types) and plant litters (2 crops, 14 forest, and 2 grasses) of different ages were measured. Discrimination of plant litters from the soils was ambiguous in the visible and near-infrared (0.4-1.1 mu m) wavelength region. An absorption feature associated with cellulose and lignin was observed at 2.1 mu m in the spectra of dry plant litter, which was not present in the spectra of soils. A new spectral variable, cellulose absorption index (CAI), was defined using the relative depth of the reflectance spectra at 2.1 mu m. CAI of dry litter was significantly greater than CAI of soils. CAI generally decreased with age of the litter. Water absorption dominated the spectral properties of both soils and plant litter and significantly reduced the CAI of the plant litters. Nevertheless, the CAI of wet litter was significantly greater than CAI of wet soil. This study provides a new methodology to discriminate plant litter from soils by differences in spectral reflectance produced by their physical and chemical attributes. This remote sensing method should improve quantification of plant litter cover and thus improve estimates of phytomass production, surface energy balance, and the effectiveness of soil conservation practices. Plant litter reflectance is a verifiable component in vegetative landscapes and should be labeled and modeled separately from soils in landscape studies. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 2000.

TI Spatial scaling of a remotely sensed surface parameter by contexture
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

ID LEAF-AREA INDEX; HETEROGENEITY; TEXTURE
AB Various remote sensing sensors observe the Earth's surface at different spacial resolutions. In deriving surface parameters using remotely sensed data,the transportability of algorithms from one resolution to another is often of great concern because of the surface heterogenity. This article addresses this scaling issue through image degradation experiments using a Landsat TM image. It is shown theoretically that scaling problems in deriving surface parameters exist not only because of nonlinearity in the relationships between re-mofe sensing measurements such as NDVI(normalized difference vegetation index) and SR (simple ratio) and the parameters of interest, but also because of the discontinuity between contrasting cover types within a mixed pixel. To quantify the effects of the nonlinearity and discontinuity on scaling, it is found that contextural parameters are more: effective than textural parameters. Contexture-based functions ns are derived for the estimation of the scaling effects: on leaf area index (LAI) calculations using algorithms based on NDVI and SR separately. Based on NDVI-LAI and SR-LAI relationships that were derived at the Landsat TM scale (30 m) as part of the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), the effects of scaling on the retrieval of LAI were investigated using nine selected areas of the same size (990 mX990 m) but different water area fractions The following conclusions are drawn from the investigation: 1) Negative biases in the estimation of LAI occur when either the NDVI or SR algorithm derived at a fine resolution (Landsat TM) is used for calculations at a coarse resolution (for example, AVHRR). 2) The amount of the biases depends on the surface heterogenity . For a pure forest pixel, the bias caused by the nonlinearity of the NDVI algorithm was smaller than 2% and the linear SR algorithm induces no error in scaling. Therefore, the scaling problem for pure pixels may be ignored for many applications using either linens or non-linear algorithms. 3) Large negative-biases occur when a pixel contains interfaces between two or more contrasting surfaces. In the case of two contrasting surfaces between vegetation and open water; the biases can be up to 45% of the correct value depending of the water area fraction in the pixel. The biases in this case depend on contexture and little on texture. Simulations show; that the most useful contextural parameter for quantifying the scaling effects in vegetation-water;ater mixed pixels is the water area fraction within each degraded pixel. Algorithms for remote sensing applications can be transported from one scale to another, if the information on the water body size is available. This study shows the need for global water masks; at high resolutions for the purpose of accurate derivation of surface parameters maps at various resolutions. In boreal regions, this is particularly important because of the large number of small water bodies. Crown copyright (C) 1999. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Fluorescence,measurements were carried out with;, the ground-based DLidaR-2 of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in October 1994 oz pine trees (Pinus sylvestris L.) located in two differently polluted areas of eastern Germany. The DLidaR-2 instrument is a far-field;fluorescence lidar exciting the leaves with a doubled or tripled air-cooled Nd:YAG laser The lidar is configured as a coaxial system with variable beam divergence; irz front of the receiving telescope. The detection unit is set up with several channels equipped with; sensitive photomultiplier and interference and blocking filters for spectral separation. At two test sites (Neuglobsow, Rosa) as part of the SANA project, five nl-eas including three groups with five pine trees were selected Sor the fluorescence lidar measurements. At each area twigs in the zipper crown;iz of the 15 selected trees were cut. The young needles Ori rst needle age class) were prepared for pigment analysis (chlorophyll a and b), nutrition element analysis (e.g., Mg, K) and for the determination, of biochemical parameters (e.g., reduced glutnthione-GSH; glutathione reductase-GLR; superoxide dismutase-SOD, and soluble protein-PROT. Additional tip necroses were estimated for both needle age classes. The results show that the current year's needles from, the polluted site (Rosa) contain more SO4-S and antioxidants than those from nz the reference al-en (Neuglobsow ro). For both test sites a correlation between the detoxification enzyme SOD and the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio (F685/F730) is observed (r=0.82) as well as for chlorophyll a and b concentration and the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio (r=0.82). The blue-green fluorescence ratio (F440/F520) is also correlated with; damage symptoms as, Sor example, the needle damage index (r=0.83), which is derived from visual inspection of the needles. Taking into account that the fluorescence lidar measurements present an average over different twigs; alzneedles of different age, it can be summarized that lidar-measurements from the ground can yield useful information about the vitality; state of the trees. Therefore,Sere,differention between;een stressed and nonstressed trees is obvious. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1999.

ID IMAGERY; SYSTEM
AB We conducted in 1994 and 1995; several airborne campaigns with an aircraft version of the POLDER (POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance) instrument. We flew over the Straits of Dover. The main goal of this activity was to see how well we can, characterize the atmospheric aerosols using POLDER data in order to achieve atmospheric corrections for ocean color purposes. We also set up atmospheric measurements (solar extinction, sky radiance, and degree of polarization) on which we tested classical aerosol medals (Junge size distribution; Shettle and Fenn, 1979) for retrieval. For standard meteorological visibilities, such models allow correct matching of the measurements. For most turbid days, if is shown that a submicron particles haze can be superposed to the continental aerosol background. But we indicated that the SF models enable a good retrieval of the measurements. They thus appear relevant to describe more complex situations. Classically, we first used POLDER images to select an aerosol model based on the spectral dependence of the aerosol reflectance between the red and the infrared for which the water is dark off-shore of the Straits. Compared again to the SF models, the spectral dependence observed differ substantially bl large angular variations. A detailed analysis showed that these large dispersions are not related to instrumental noise but to natural variation of the aerosols and to residual errors in the Fresnel reflection correction. By averaging, we can also propose SF models. Both ground-based and POLDER-derived aerosol models are consistent In terms of retrieval of the atmospheric functions required for atmospheric corrections. We also tried less successfully a selection based on the polarized reflectance which is a POLDER capability. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB This report describes remote sensing experiments using highly capable polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR). In preparation for the launch of the SIR-C/X-SAR mission, NASA's JPL airborne polarimetric SAR (AIRSAR) was deployed over,many locations worldwide. The report describes SAR observations of desert dune fields in North American, Bolivia, and Australia acquired by AIRSAR and in Namibia acquired by SIR-C/X-SAR. The use of polarimetric and multiwavelength SAR is reviewed and comments on the advantages of the various combinations are noted. SAR data are very useful in mapping dunes because of the ability to control illumination parameters such as look angle, wavelength, and polarization. Furthermore, the unique responses of SAR to surface roughness are found very useful in mapping dune forms. For most sites, the longer wavelengths, P- and L-band at lambda=68 cm and 24 cm, are advantageous over the shorter (C-band at lambda.=5.6 cm) providing better contrast. Overall, copolarized channels (HH and W) are found best for mapping the dunes and dune types. When trying to discriminate active from inactive dunes cross-polarized channels provide essential information on vegetation. (C) Elsevier Science lnc., 1998.

AB The effects of terrain on conifer stand reflectance were estimated using sensitivity analysis of the Li and Strahler bidirectional reflectance (BRDF) model, and model inversions with both simulated and real Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) reflectance data. Emphasis was placed on surface characteristics, and atmospheric correction was assumed. The results of sensitivity analysis indicated that strong interactive effects between nadir coverage of crowns, stand structure, and the slope and aspect of the stand occur in the reflectance data. This was supported by the results of model inversions using simulated reflectance data of sloping stands. It was found that, by neglecting slope in the inversion process, significant errors occurred iia the retrieved values of forest coverage. Finally, inversion was tested using real TM reflectance data from a mountainous site in British Columbia, with a digital terrain model (DTM), forest attribute data, and the 6S atmospheric code. The results indicate that the effects of.sloping terrain would preclude the retrieval of forest coverage unless terrain effects were specifically included in the inversion process.

AB This article presents an analysis of ERS-1 wind-scatterometer (WSC) data acquired over a region located in the northern Sahel. The considered period extends from January 1992 to December 1995, that is, covering four vegetation cycles. Experimental observations show that WSC responses at 45 degrees of incidence angle display a marked seasonality associated with the development and senescence of annual grasses during the successive rainy seasons. The interpretation of the sigma degrees temporal plots is performed with the assistance of a semiempirical backscattering model combined with an ecosystem grassland model. Contributions of the various components of the Sahelian landscape to the total backscattering are identified. Overall, the soil contribution is always large but the sigma degrees(45) temporal plots reflect well the vegetation development. The analysis of the different contributions leads to a simplification of the backscattering model. Finally, this latter is parameterized as a function of two surface parameters, namely, the soil volumetric water content and the vegetation biomass. This simplified model allows the vegetation biomass to be estimated with a 33% error. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

ID SAVANNA FIRES; IDENTIFICATION; LIMITATIONS; TROPICS; CYCLES
AB The effect of fires on land cover was investigated with coarse spatial resolution remote sensing data on West Africa. We tested whether fires lead to land-cover changes or maintain land cover in a state of equilibrium. This was measured independently for early- and late-season fires, for different ecological zones, and for areas characterized by different levels of land-use intensity. Spatial associations between broad-scale land-cover-change maps and fire-distribution maps were calculated. The statistical results reveal that, for a few subregions, there is a statistically significant relation between fire occurrence and land-cover changes as measured by coarse-resolution remote sensing data, whereas, at a broad scale, there is no such relation. The main conclusion is that the scale of the data analyzed in this study is inappropriate for reaching any definitive conclusion on the effect of fires on land cover. This is due, first, to an inadequate spatial resolution to detect all fires and their associated ecological effects and second, to the heterogeneity of the population, given the size of the study area.

AB The potential for he combined use of microwave and optical data for crop management is explored with the use of images acquired in the visible, near-infrared, and thermal spectrum and the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) wavelengths in the Ku (14.85 GHz) and C (15.3 GHz) bands. The images were obtained during June 1994 and covered an agricultural site composed of large fields of partial-cover cotton, near-full-cover alfalfa, and bare soil fields of varying roughness. Results showed that the SAR Ku backscatter coefficient (Ku-band sigma degrees) teas sensitive to soil roughness and insensitive to soil moisture conditions when vegetation was present. When soil roughness conditions were relatively similar (e.g., for cotton fields of similar row direction and for all alfalfa fields), Ku-band sigma degrees was sensitive to the fraction of the surface covered by vegetation. Under these conditions, the Ku-band sigma degrees and the optical normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were generally correlated. The SAR C backscatter coefficient (C-band sigma degrees) was found to be sensitive to soil moistu re conditions for cotton fields with green leaf area index (GLAI) less than 1.0 and alfalfa fields with GLAI nearly 2.0. For both low-GLAI cotton and alfalfa, C-band sigma degrees was correlated with measurements of surface temperature (T-s). A theoretical basis for the relations between Ku-band sigma degrees and NDVI and between C-band sigma degrees and T-s was presented and supported with on-site measurements. On the basis of these findings, some combined optical and radar approaches are suggested for crop management applications. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

ID APERTURE RADAR DATA; MULTIFREQUENCY; PARAMETERS
AB Mapping forest cover types in the boreal ecosystem is important for understanding the processes governing the interaction of the surface with the atmosphere. In this paper we report the results of the land-cover classification of the SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data acquired during the Boreal Ecosystem Atmospheric Study's intensive field campaigns over the southern study area near Prince Albert, Canada. A Bayesian maximum a posteriori classifier was applied on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory airborne SAR images covering the region during the peak of the growing season in July 1994. The approach is supervised in the sense that a combination of field data and existing land-cover maps are used to develop training areas for the desired classes. The images acquired were first radiometrically and absolutely calibrated the incidence angle effect in airborne images was corrected to art acceptable accuracy, and the images were used in a mosaic form and geocoded and georeferenced with an existing land-cover map for validation purposes. The results shore that SAR images can be classified into dominant forest types such as jack pine, black spruce, trembling aspen, clearing, open. water and three categories of mired strands with better than 90% accuracy. The unispecies stands such as jack pine and black spruce are separated with 98% accuracy, but the accuracy of mixed coniferous and deciduous stands suffers from confusing factors such as varying species composition, surface moisture, and understory effects. To satisfy the requirements of process models, the number of cover types was reduced from eight to five general classes of conifer wet, conifer dry, mixed deciduous, disturbed, and open water. Reduction of classes improved the overall accuracy of the classification over the entire region from 77% to 92%. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB Ground-based nadir and off-nadir radiometric measurements were collected on the North Slope of Alaska in early June to determine their utility in 1) differentiating arctic tundra vegetation community types through remote sensing, and 2) examining differences in structure and phenology of arctic tundra vegetation communities. We employed a PS-II (personal spectrometer II) portable field spectroradiometer to measure narrow-band spectra at nadir and the PARABOLA (portable apparatus for rapid acquisition of bidirectional observations of the land and atmosphere) three-channel radiometer to gather bidirectional radiometric data over almost the complete ground hemisphere. Measurements were taken at a lowland wet sedge site and at two tussock tundra sites containing different amounts of woody deciduous shrub cover. PS-II nadir measurements alone allowed spectral differentiation between the highly senescent wet sedge site and the two relatively greener tussock tundra sites but did not allow clear discrimination between tussock tundra sites. Off-nadir measurements, however, permitted good discrimination between the two tussock tundra sites. For example, the reflectance-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVIrho) difference between the tussock tunda sites at a 75 degrees forward-scatter view angle averaged 26% over a range of solar zenith angles (Theta(s)s). Similarly, NDVI rho calculated from PARABOLA spectral hemispheric data averaged 6% higher in woody tussock tundra than in nonwoody tussock tundra. Differences between the tussock sites calculated by using NDVI based on hemispheric radiance (NDVIL) were greater than those calculated by using hemispheric NDVI rho by approximately a factor of two regardless of Theta(s). Measurements taken when Theta(s)=75 degrees generally exhibited the largest differences between NDVI at the two tussock tundra sites. Although nadir measurements exhibited minimal differences between tussock tundra types, bidirectional and hemispheric-based NDVI values revealed differences in tussock tundra woody vegetation cover because large view zenith angles were sensitive to the woody shrub foliage that extends above the hummocky tundra surface in early spring. These results may be useful for detecting changes in tundra woody cover through time. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB A group of volcanoes northeast of Aksayqin Lake, in the western Kunlun Mountains, China, have been identified on multifrequency, multipolarization spaceborne imaging radar-C/X-band synthetic aperture radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) images. Field observations made on the volcanic morphology and terrain features are described in this paper. Analysis of single-band, single-polarization radar backscatter coefficients (sigma(o)) shows that LHV best discriminates the two types of lava flows (pahoehoe and aa lavas), alluvium, and bedrock. The factors affecting the radar backscattering coefficient also are analyzed. Finally, this paper presents K-Ar isotopic ages of volcanic samples collected in the field and discusses the volcanic samples collected in the field and discusses the volcanism in the area.

AB We modified a PAM fluorimeter for remote detection from 0.5 m to 1 m distance by using a laser diode for excitation. It permitted us to compare directly and simultaneously measurements of relative fluorescence yield to the measurements of lifetime with the tau-LIDAR performed under natural conditions. The existence of a linear relationship, and therefore the equivalence between the lifetime and yield for chlorophyll fluorescence estimation in vivo was confirmed here for several plant types and under both optimal conditions and conditions of water stress. We have also shown that fluorescence lifetime measurements, with the tau-LIDAR, can be used to perform complex fluorescence quenching analysis in fluorosensing, like the one developed in the laboratory for near-contact measurements with PAM-fluorimetry, Water stress effects on fluorescence changes are especially pronounced in maize plants due to the C4 type of metabolism and the absence of photorespiration. This would permit the use of the steady state level of fluorescence (F-s, tau(s)) for stress detection, provided that the irradiance is known or is estimated. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996.

AB Calibration-based area correction models provide improved estimates of cover-type proportions measured at coarse scales. Three separate regions (Plumas and Stanislaus National Forests and Lake Tahoe Basin) in the northern Sierra Nevada serve as test sites: the first for model calibration and the others for extrapolation and validation of the area correction methods. The use of one (or a few) large sites to calibrate models for extrapolative application over large areas represents a global test-site sampling strategy that most easily can be employed for the development of global land cover and land-cover change products. The inverse estimator, calibrated on scale-specific interclass transition matrices, produces the best overall results at the coarser scales for both validation sites. Good results probably occur because the conditional probabilities in the transition matrices implicitly carry information about the spatial organization of the landscape. This method performs poorly at finer scales, or in cases where the calibration and validation sites have dissimilar spatial organization, or class confusions. The slope estimator, calibrated on the coefficients of scale-specific proportion transition lines, produces improved estimates over uncorrected values at all scales. The slope estimator appears to generalize most successfully because It characterizes the basic tendency of small classes to diminish and large classes to increase in size as the landscape is represented at increasingly coarser scales. The positive results achieved using the inverse estimator and the slope estimator indicate potential for using such a posteriori calibration methods to improve coarse resolution land-cover area estimates over large regions.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB Collecting reference samples for accuracy assessment is expensive, so that statistical procedures that improve the precision (reduce variance) of estimators of thematic map accuracy while incurring little additional cost are desirable. Auxiliary data available from existing land-cover maps, aerial photographs, videography, or AVHRR, for example, can be used in combination with ground visits to enhance the precision of map accuracy estimates. This precision gain is achieved by employing a regression estimator commonly used in survey sampling. Practically important gains in precision can be achieved with no additional complication in the sampling design and without additional field visits. The only additional cost incurred is that of obtaining the auxiliary data. The regression estimator can be used with simple random or systematic sampling if auxiliary information is available on the entire region represented by the land cover map. Alternatively, a more practical design for accuracy assessment would be double sampling, which requires that the auxiliary information be obtained for only a subsample of the map region. Appropriate estimators and standard errors are presented for using the regression estimator with either simple random or double sampling. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1996.

AB In vivo absorption spectra, pigment concentrations from algal cultures, and field samples (Po Delta, Northern Italy) are analyzed to differentiate the contribution by each optically active constituent to the total absorption by the water. The results yield systematic trends in the blue:red and blue:NIR absorption ratio for living phytoplankton cells and detrital material, which are then used to retrieve the absorption coefficient of dissolved organic material (yellow substance) at 410 nm from the total in vivo absorption coefficients of natural waters at 410 nm, 670 not, and 730 nm. A simple model was then been applied to retrieve in situ absorption coefficient by yellow substance and for different values of blue:red/NIR absorption ratios. Sensitivity and regional tests in the studied site and in the Baltic shores that the model can explain more than 85% of the variance in the observed data under various conditions of turbidity, and shows that predicted yellow substance is more sensitive to a change in detrital material than a change in living phytoplankton. Such work can be used with remote sensing techniques to differentiate the optically active constituents in coastal and turbid waters. Suggestions are given to solve the problem related to the backscattering coefficient of the water, and to propose an accurate method to remove the atmospheric effect from the remotely sensed signal.

AB A lightweight, rugged, high-spectral-resolution interferometer has been built by Designs and Prototypes based on a set of specifications provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Dr. J. W. Salisbury (Johns Hopkins University). The instrument, the micro Fourier Transform Interferometer (mu FTIR), permits the acquisition of infrared spectra of natural surfaces. Such data can be used to validate low and high spectral resolution data acquired remotely from aircraft and spacecraft in the 3-5 mu m and 8-14 mu m atmospheric windows. The instrument has a spectral resolution of similar to 6 wavenumbers, weighs 16 kg including batteries and computer, and can be operated easily by two people in the field. Laboratory analysis indicates the instrument is spectrally calibrated to better than 1 wavenumber and the radiometric accuracy is < 0.5 K if the radiances from the blackbodies used for calibration bracket the radiance from the sample. Several examples of field spectra are provided for a variety of rock types, minerals, and vegetation.

AB A simple single-scattering model for a surface with sparse erectophile plants Is developed as a plane-parallel canopy consisting of small leaves (relative to leaf-to-leaf spacing) with a spherical-shell distribution of the leaf area. The contributions to the overall surface reflectance in the visible spectral bands by the soil-reflectance, leaf-reflection, and leaf-transmission (which are assumed isotropic) are analyzed under different view/illumination geometries. High values of leaf reflectance r, relative to leaf transmittance t, produce significantly different patterns of bidirectional reflectance, because r and t control the backscattering and the forward scattering, respectively. These two effects, especially strong at large solar zenith angles, produce high canopy reflectance at large view zenith angles around the principal plane. Model inversion with the PARABOLA bidirectional reflectance measurements over the Konza Prairie yield values of r and t for grassblades of this grassland canopy. The inversion results point to a possibility of assessing canopy condition from its bidirectional reflectances, as both r and t are sensitive to plant vigor and phenology. In an inversion with satellite measurements over a desert-scrub surface in the northern Sinai, the optical thickness of these dark plants (inferred in the visible band) and the near-infrared reflectance of the plant elements were inferred. The value of the optical thickness of this sparse canopy essentially did not depend on the assumed plant-element transmittance, but the inferred infrared reflectances of the plant elements were appreciably dependent. The canopy structure representation (the spherical-shell distribution of the planar leaf area) constitutes a rotation-invariant reflectance model. It allows formulation of the longwave exchanges identical to the conventional radiative transfer calculation through a layer of molecules or particles with a specified optical thickness.

TI EVALUATION OF THE AIRSAR SYSTEM FOR SOIL-MOISTURE ANALYSIS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In many disciplines of science, soil moisture content (SMC) is an. important parameter for modeling of dynamic water cycles. In this study, the sensitivity of the backscattering coefficient was investigated in conjunction with the soil moisture content of vegetation-covered (corn) fields. As part of the MAC-Europe campaign in July 1991, the NASA/JPL three-frequency polarimetric AIRSAR system collected data over a test site at Oberpfaffenhofen in Germany. The AIRSAR overflight at Oberpfaffenhofen was complemented by intensive ground truth measurements The study was carried out with a monotemporal data set. The sampled corn fields are nearly in the same SAR incidence angle range (approximate to 30 degrees) to avoid effects caused by differences in the local incidence angle. The fields include three different soil types to get more variation in SMC. In summary, it can be stated that at L-band, and especially at C-band, frequencies and an incidence angle of approximately 30 degrees, the attenuation coefficient of the vegetation canopy is too high for monitoring soil moisture with only a monotemporal data set. Other parameters like phenology, plant density and geometry, and row direction mask differences in the SMC. The results show that the backscattering, measuring using the P-band, can be well described with just two parameters. SMC is the dominant parameter influencing the backscattering. The secondary parameter is the row direction of the corn plants relative to look direction. With these two parameters, about 90% of the backscattering can be described. The best polarization combinations for SMC analysis are HH polarization and the difference in power between HH and HV polarizations. The study results suggest that the P-band is very suitable for soil moisture analysis from SAR imagery.

AB Sampling Landsat TM imagery for land use is a very efficient method of data acquisition for many environmental models. These grid-based models are often used in the modeling of the long range transport and deposition of air pollutants. In this article, a simple procedure for estimating proportions of different land use in grid cells with sample unit Landsat TM picture element is presented. In the procedure, the bias of the maximum likelihood classification of the sample is corrected using double sampling. For a small number of random pixels, the true classification has to be provided additionally. From the comparison of the true classification and the maximum likelihood classification, the amount of bias in each estimate from misclassification is estimated. In this article, the case with several land-use classes is discussed.

AB Ecosystem process, biosphere-atmosphere transfer, and carbon exchange models all require parameterization of the land surface, including land vegetation cover and soil moisture. Although not yet a demonstrated global capability, the most feasible method for obtaining these parameters and updating them periodically, is satellite remote sensing. In this paper we will summarize our understanding of the desired land surface parameters, including soil moisture, and provide an assessment of the state of the art of surface state remote sensing algorithms to infer those parameters on a global basis.
   First, we will consider a) modeling requirements for land cover parameters, including vegetation community composition and biophysical parameters, for example, leaf area index (LAI), biomass density, fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (Fpar) absorbed by the vegetated land surface, and b) modeling requirements for soil moisture.
   We will then review the status of remote sensing algorithms for obtaining these parameters and examine a number of issues involved in the global implementation and testing of these algorithms. Finally, we will look at future needs to make global mapping of land cover parameters a reality.

TI MAPPING AND MONITORING CONIFER MORTALITY USING REMOTE-SENSING IN THE
   LAKE TAHOE BASIN
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID THEMATIC MAPPER DATA; TASSELED CAP
AB A prolonged drought in the western United States has resulted in alarming levels of mortality in conifer forests. Satellite remote sensing holds the potential for mapping and monitoring the effects of such environmental changes over large geographic areas in a timely manner. Results from the application of a forest canopy reflectance model using multitemporal Landsat TM imagery and field measurements, indicate conifer mortality can be effectively mapped and inventoried. The test area for this project is the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit in the Sierra Nevada of California. The Landsat TM images are from the summers of 1988 and 1991. The Li-Strahler canopy model estimates several forest stand parameters, including tree size and canopy cover for each conifer stand, from reflectance values in satellite imagery. The difference in cover estimates between the dates forms the basis for stratifying stands into mortality classes, which are used as both themes in a map and the basis of the field sampling design. Field measurements from 61 stands collected in the summer of 1992 indicate 15% of the original timber volume in the true fir zone died between 1988 and 1992. The resulting low standard error of 11% for this estimate indicates the utility of these mortality classes for detecting areas of high mortality. Also, the patterns in the estimated mean timber volume loss for each class follow the expected trends. The results of this project are immediately useful for fire hazard management, by providing both estimates of the degree of overall mortality and maps showing its location. They also indicate current remote sensing technology may be useful for monitoring the changes in vegetation that are expected to result from climate change.

AB In this article we apply an analytical solution of the radiosity equation to compute vegetation indices, reflectance spectra, and the spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function for simple canopy geometries. We show that nonlinear spectral mixing occurs due to multiple reflection and transmission from surfaces. We compare radiosity-derived spectra with single scattering or linear mixing models. We also develop a simple model to predict the reflectance spectrum of binary and ternary mineral mixtures of faceted surfaces. The two-facet model is validated by measurements of the reflectance.

AB Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) microscopy and reflectance spectroscopy were used to evaluate the response of leaf spectral reflectance to chloroplast relative water content (RWC). For sun and shade leaves of maple (Acer platanoides L. var Emerald Queen), NMR determined the distribution of water through the leaf thickness and changes in distribution as leaves dried from 100% RWC to approximately 70%, 50%, and 30% RWC. Chloroplast water could be resolved only in shade leaves. Leaf and chloroplast RWC were similar at leaf RWC of 80% or greater, but chloroplast RWC was as much as 12% greater than leaf RWC when leaf RWC decreased below 50%. In contrast, the RWC of nonchloroplast water compartments was as much as 12% less than leaf RWC. Reflectance responses to leaf water content were greatest in the water absorption bands near 1450 nm, 1950 nm, and 2500 nm wavelengths, and were minimal in the near-infrared from approximately 760-1300 nm. In the 400-760 nm (visible) range, reflectance sensitivity increased substantially as chloroplast RWC decreased. Peak visible reflectance sensitivity occurred near 695 nm and 670 nm for adaxial and abaxial surfaces, respectively, and was more closely related to chloroplast than to nonchloroplast or whole leaf RWC.

AB The spectral leaf reflectance properties of field bean (Vicia faba) infected by the fungus Botrytis fabae were investigated over the wavelength range 400-1100 nm. The percentage of leaf surface affected by lesions was estimated, as well as fresh weight, and content of photosynthetic pigments per unit leaf area. Measurements of photosynthetic rates and stomatal conductance were conducted on groups of diseased and control leaves. Chlorophyll b content increased significantly as the pro-portion of leaf surface infected increased, but no statistically significant change was observed in chlorophyll a content. Rates of leaf photosynthesis were reduced significantly compared to healthy leaves even at low levels of infection (<10%). Reduced photosynthesis may be attributed to decreased stomatal conductance. No changes in spectral reflectance were evident before visual symptoms were observed. The most significant changes in spectral reflectance associated with the disease were a flattening of the response in the visible region and a decrease in the near-infrared reflectance shoulder at 800 nm. Both these responses may be attributed to collapse of leaf cell structure as the fungus spread. Correlations between percentage infection and reflectance in the visible region (peaks at 525 nm and 580 nm) were higher in the first-order derivative spectra than for the original, zero-order reflectance spectra, whereas the red-edge location was poorly correlated with infection. Second-order derivative spectra gave lower correlations with infection. First-order derivatives of leaf reflectance could therefore be useful for remote sensing of this disease and other diseases and stresses which result in necrosis of leaf tissue, if detectable at the canopy level.

TI DERIVATION OF SCALED SURFACE REFLECTANCES FROM AVIRIS DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID RADIATION
AB Analysis of high resolution imaging spectrometer data requires a thorough compensation for atmospheric absorption and scattering. A method for retrieving ''scaled surface reflectances,'' assuming horizontal surfaces having Lambertian reflectances, from spectral data collected by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) (Vane, 1987) is presented here. In this method, the integrated water vapor amount on a pixel by pixel basis is derived from the 0.94-mum and 1.1 4-mum water vapor absorption features. The transmission spectrum Of water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), ozone (O3), nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH4), and oxygen (O2) in the 0.4-2.5 mum region is simulated based on the derived water vapor value, the solar and the observational geometry, and through use of narrow band spectral models. The scattering effect due to atmospheric molecules and aerosols is modeled with the 5S computer code (Tanre et al., 1986). The AVIRIS radiances are divided by solar irradiances above the atmosphere to obtain the apparent reflectances. The scaled surface reflectances are derived from the apparent reflectances using the simulated atmospheric gaseous transmittances and the simulated molecular and aerosol scattering data. The scaled surface reflectances differ from the real surface reflectances by a multiplicative factor. In order to convert the scaled surface reflectances into real surface reflectances, the slopes and aspects of the surfaces must be known. For simplicity, the scaled surface reflectance is simply referred to as the ''surface reflectance'' in this article. The method described here is most applicablefor deriving surface reflectances from AVIRIS data acquired on clear days with visibilities 20 km or greater. More rigorous atmospheric radiative tranfer modeling is required in order to derive surface reflectances from AVIRIS data measured on hazy days.

AB Airborne and satellite remote sensing systems (PMI/FLI, Landsat-Thematic Mapper, and SPOT-HRV) were used to assess their potential for inland water quality detection and monitoring. Airborne imaging spectrometry was acquired. Simultaneous (sub)surface spectroradiometric and laboratory-based spectrophotometric measurements allowed the description of the underwater lightfield through determination of the inherent and apparent optical properties. Spectral signature simulation of various systems increased understanding of the performances and led to the development of the CAESAR Inland Water Mode spectral bandset. These results apply to the operational use of high resolution airborne systems (CASI) and are relevant for future satellite systems such as MERIS, MODIS, and HIRIS, especially in the area of data reduction through selection of spectral bands and the development of algorithms.

AB Research has shown that soil moisture information can be retrieved by passive microwave remote sensing.  This is even possible when there is a vegetation canopy present if the effects of the vegetation are corrected for.  Vegetation correction algorithms must attempt to include all significant physical parameters, yet they must also only require data that can be readily obtained.  Previous research proposed a model that attempted to meet these requirements.  Critical to this model is the estimation of a vegetation parameter b that characterizes the canopy.  In this study we evaluated published data to determine the functional dependence of this parameter on vegetation characteristics.

TI ESTIMATING GRAIN-YIELD OF MATURING RICE CANOPIES USING HIGH SPECTRAL
   RESOLUTION REFLECTANCE MEASUREMENTS
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB The grain yield of paddy rice was estimated from high spectral resolution reflectance (R) data (400 - 1900 nm interval) taken approximately 1.5 months after heading (approximately physiological maturity of the grain) during three crop seasons (1985, 1986, and 1987).  Spectral data were smoothed by simple moving averages 20 nm and 40 nm wide and the second derivatives of R and log(1/R) were calculated for 60 central wavelengths between 480 nm and 1680 nm.  The multiple linear regressions for these 60 central wavelengths and also for all the combinations of normalized difference indices from them versus grain yield were obtained.  The smoothed and the second derivatives of reflectance and the normalized differences for each season were individually used to derive regression equations to estimate the remaining two seasons' yields.  Normalized differences computed from second derivatives of R were more effective and stable for multiseasonal estimations of yield than the smoothed reflectances or the second derivatives of the reflectances and log(1/R).  This result offers a method to evaluate the grain yield of crops whose grain weight increases during senescence and is therefore affected by the weather and agronomic conditions late in the season.

AB Accurately monitoring soybean growth stages (SGSs) is crucial for successful crop management and the development of agricultural information systems. This study focused on 18 states that accounted for over 95% of the soybean area in the United States from 2013 to 2020. We proposed an SMFs-APTT method that integrates crop data layers (CDLs), time-series of VIIRS data, and meteorological data. It combines a shape-model function in separate meteorological stages (SMFs) with a crop model that relies on an accumulated photothermal time (APTT). This approach provides both full-season and within-season monitoring of four soybean growth stages (SGSs); i.e., emergence, blooming, pod-setting, and leaf-dropping. Based on the results obtained from the SMFsAPTT method, a long short-term memory (LSTM) model was employed to predict SGSs early. The dates of the detected and predicted SGSs were compared with National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Crop Progress and Condition Report (CPR) statistical data for analysis and verification. Our results show the following. (1) For the full-season extraction of SGSs, the average root mean square error (RMSE) derived using the SMFs-APTT method was 0.86-3.06 days and that obtained using the SMFs method was 1.56-3.26 days. (2) For the withinseason monitoring of SGSs, the SMFs-APTT method was also able to accurately track the growth stages as early as -30 days after they reach 50% completion with an average RMSE of 2.1 days. (3) For the early prediction of SGSs, the LSTM model that was trained based on the SMFs-APTT results achieved an RMSE of -4.3 days at the state scale and could approximately predict SGSs -30 days in advance. Our findings suggest that the SMFs-APTT method provides accurate and reliable extraction of SGSs for full-season and within-season monitoring, which is of benefit to crop modeling and management. Furthermore, the LSTM model successfully forecast SGSs, indicating its potential for making early predictions.

AB Tropical deep convective clouds (DCCs) play an essential role in the Earth system. However, separating DCCs from thick anvils with satellite passive measurements is challenging. In this work, a day/night unified tropical DCC detection approach for MODIS observations is developed with a CloudSat active sensor measurement trained machine learning model. This approach combines brightness temperatures (BTs) at 6.7 mu m (BT6.7) and 11 mu m (BT11) with derived variables describing horizontal structures of DCCs and improves the tropical DCC probability of detection (POD) from 45.0% for the widely-used BT11 < 215 K method to 67.9%, while the false alarm ratio (FAR) decreases from 43.9% to 32.6%. The Heidke skill score (HSS) of the new algorithm is 0.425, which is more than doubled compared to the HSS of the BT11 < 215 K method (0.182). Moreover, the new algorithm has small biases in DCC's total amount and spatial distribution compared with the CloudSat results. The monthly DCC variations from MODIS wide-swath measurements with the new algorithm demonstrate the ability to reliably provide high temporal and spatial resolution DCC distributions to support intra-seasonal to interannual climate variability studies, which the CloudSat narrow-swath measurements lack enough samples to do. Meanwhile, the new algorithm can also be applied to measurements from other satellite passive sensors when BT6.7 and BT11 are available.

AB Protecting the future of forests relies on our ability to observe changes in forest health. Thus, developing tools for sensing diseases in a timely fashion is critical for managing threats at broad scales. Oak wilt -a disease caused by a pathogenic fungus (Bretziella fagacearum)- is threatening oaks, killing thousands yearly while negatively impacting the ecosystem services they provide. Here we propose a novel workflow for mapping oak wilt by targeting temporal disease progression through symptoms using land surface phenology (LSP) from spaceborne observations. By doing so, we hypothesize that phenological changes in pigments and photosynthetic activity of trees affected by oak wilt can be tracked using LSP metrics derived from the Chlorophyll/Carotenoid Index (CCI). We used dense time-series observations from Sentinel-2 to create Analysis Ready Data across Minnesota and Wisconsin and to derive three LSP metrics: the value of CCI at the start and end of the growing season, and the coefficient of variation of the CCI during the growing season. We integrate high-resolution airborne imagery in multiple locations to select pixels (n = 3872) from the most common oak tree health conditions: healthy, symptomatic for oak wilt, and dead. These pixels were used to train an iterative Partial Least Square Discriminant (PLSD) model and derive the probability of an oak tree (i.e., pixel) in one of these conditions and the associated uncertainty. We assessed these models spatially and temporally on testing datasets revealing that it is feasible to discriminate among the three health conditions with overall accuracy between 80 and 82%. Within conditions, our models suggest that spatial variations among three CCI-derived LSP metrics can identify healthy (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.98), symptomatic (AUC = 0.89), and dead (AUC = 0.94) oak trees with low false positive rates. The model performance was robust across different years as well. The predictive maps were used to guide local stakeholders to locate disease hotspots for ground verification and subsequent decision-making for treat-ment. Our results highlight the capabilities of LSP metrics from dense spaceborne observations to map diseases and to monitor large-scale change in biodiversity.

AB Current approaches to estimate NOx emissions fail to account for new and small sources, biomass burning, and sources which change rapidly in time, generally don't account for measurement error, and are either based on models, or do not consider wind, chemistry, and dynamical effects. This work introduces a new, model-free analytical environment that assimilates daily TROPOMI NO2 measurements in a mass-conserving manner, to invert daily NOx emissions. This is applied over a rapidly developing and energy-consuming region of Northwest China, specifically chosen due to substantial economic and population changes, new environmental policies, large use of coal, and access to independent emissions measurements for validation, making this region representative of many rapidly developing regions found across the Global South. This technique computes a net NOx emissions gain of 118% distributed in a see-saw manner: a more than doubling of emissions in cleaner regions, chemical plants, and regions thought to be emissions-free, combined with a more than halving of emissions in city centers and at well-regulated steel and powerplants. The results allow attribution of sources, with major contributing factors computed to be increased combustion temperature, atmospheric transport, and in-situ chemical processing. Furthermore, sensitivity runs that represent the range of uncertainties in the TROPOMI NO2 retrievals themselves are performed, and it is determined that the differences between the errors in TROPOMI NO2 lead to smaller errors in the emissions estimates, due to non-linear buffering built in from the physical bounds on the underlying physical and chemical driving factors. It is also observed that errors in the priori dataset contribute more than the uncertainties in the TROPOMI retrievals, opening a new door to recursive iteration between this approach and new emissions dataset development. It is hoped that these findings will drive a new look at emissions estimation and how it is related to remotely sensed measurements and associated uncertainties, especially applied to rapidly developing regions. This is especially important for understanding the loadings and impacts of short-lived climate forcers, and provides a bridge between remotely sensed data, measurement error, and models, while allowing for further improvement of identification of new, small, and rapidly changing sources.

AB Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is a rapidly advancing front in modeling global terrestrial gross primary production (GPP). Canopy total SIF emissions (SIFtotal) are mechanistically linked to the plant photo-synthesis, and can be estimated from satellite observed SIF (SIFobs) through radiative transfer modeling. How-ever, the current satellite SIFobs and thus SIFtotal are available only at coarse spatial resolutions from several kilometers to tens of kilometers, inhibiting the application at fine spatial scales. Here, we proposed an algorithm to generate both global high-resolution SIFtotal (HSIFtotal) and high-resolution SIFobs (HSIFobs) at 1 km from low-resolution SIFobs (LSIFobs) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), which has a spatial resolution at nadir of 3.5 km by 5.6-7 km. Our statistical method is based on the law of energy conservation and uses satellite derived fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, fluorescence efficiency, and the escape probability of fluorescence. We evaluated the accuracy of our HSIFtotal using the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 SIF (R2 = 0.78). We found that the spatial resolution had clear effects on the relationship between HSIFtotal and GPP. We also compared HSIFtotal to 8-day averaged tower GPP from 135 flux sites and found that they were better correlated when HSIFtotal was averaged over a 1-km radius around the tower than when averaged over a larger radius. Our study provided a unique high-resolution HSIFtotal product, which will advance the estimation of GPP by extrapolating site-level relationships to the global scale.

AB As a critical source of food and one of the most economically significant crops in the world, soybean plays an important role in achieving food security. Large area accurate mapping of soybean has long been a vital, but challenging issue in remote sensing, relying heavily on large-volume and representative training samples, whose collection is time-consuming and inefficient, especially for large areas (e.g., national scale). Thus, methods are needed that can map soybean automatically and accurately from single-date remotely sensed imagery. In this research, a novel Greenness and Water Content Composite Index (GWCCI) was proposed to map soybean from just a single Sentinel-2 multispectral image in an end-to-end manner without employing training samples. By capitalizing on the product of the NDVI (related to greenness) and the short-wave infrared (SWIR) band (related to canopy water content), the GWCCI provides the required information with which to discriminate between soybean and other land cover types. The effectiveness of the proposed GWCCI was investigated in seven typical soybean planting regions within four major soybean-producing countries across the world (i.e., China, the United States, Brazil and Argentina), with diverse climates, cropping systems and agricultural landscapes. In the experiments, an optimal threshold of 0.17 was estimated and adopted by the GWCCI in the first study site (S1) in 2021, and then generalised to the other study sites over multiple years for soybean mapping. The GWCCI method achieved a consistently higher accuracy in 2021 compared to two conventional comparative classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)), with an average overall accuracy (OA) of 88.30% and a Kappa coefficient (k) of 0.77; significantly greater than those of RF (OA: 80.92%, k: 0.62) and SVM (OA: 80.29%, k: 0.60). Furthermore, the OA of the extended years was highly consistent with that of 2021 for study sites S2 to S7, demonstrating the great generalisation capability and robustness of the proposed approach over multiple years. The proposed GWCCI method is straightforward, reliable and robust, and represents an important step forward for mapping soybean, one of the most significant crops grown globally.

AB Penetration depth of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signals over a desert is a key parameter to understand the internal properties of the desert. Existing approaches for obtaining the penetration depth require good quality interferometric SAR (InSAR) data of very short temporal and long spatial baselines. Such data are often difficult to obtain in a highly dynamic desert. We propose a new machine learning (ML) based approach for inverting penetration depth of SAR signals over large desert areas by jointly using InSAR, polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) and optical remote sensing data. First, SAR scattering parameters and terrain properties are determined based on PolSAR and Landsat 5 TM multispectral data and a DEM. The penetration depth of SAR signals over a small desert area is obtained based on methods such as using a scattering model. A random forest model is then used to establish the relationship between the SAR scattering parameters and site features, and the penetration depth, and then is used to derive the penetration depth over a large desert area. The approach is applied to calculate the penetration depth of ALOS-1 PALSAR L-band signals for a large part of the Kufra Basin, an area of about 60, 000 km2. The penetration depths of four types of typical landforms in area (i.e., sandy plains, paleochannels, rocks and man-made features) are discussed in relation to the geological and climatic conditions. The average signal penetration depths over the paleochannels, sandy plains, and rocks and man-made features are 2.84 m, 1.97 m, 1.21 m, respectively. It is found that the backscattering coefficient, dielectric constant, surface roughness and mineral composition are the most important parameters in determining the signal penetration depths. An interesting point is that the existence of hematite in the sand can increase the dielectric dissipation of the sand medium and shorten the signal penetration depth.

AB Obtaining in-situ land surface temperature (LST) with thermal infrared or longwave radiometers for validating satellite LST, namely the radiation-based method, is one of the most widely used approaches. Due to the rela-tively short path lengths, the near-surface atmosphere contribution is generally ignored in radiation-based in-situ LST measuring for narrowband radiometers. However, it is necessary to investigate the influence for broadband radiometers. In this study, nine stations in China are selected to quantify the atmospheric influence. Furthermore, a correction method combining the Radiative Transfer Equation and Multi-Layer Meteorological Parameters (RTE-MLMP) is proposed to correct the influence on radiation-based in-situ LST. Results show that the influence follows diurnal patterns and seasonal differences. Depending on the station, ignoring the near-surface atmo-sphere influence can cause in-situ LST to be overestimated (underestimated) by up to 3.11 (1.21) K at nighttime (daytime). For the RTE-MLMP method, the key is to estimate the near-surface atmospheric transmittance (TNS) and radiance (LNS) and to establish equations for each station. Results show that the mean and standard deviation (STD) of the error are both lower than 0.001 for the estimated TNS, and lower than 0.1 W/m2 and 0.6 W/m2 for the estimated LNS, respectively. Then, the in-situ LST is corrected with the estimated TNS and LNS. The resulting LST mean and STD of its error are both lower than 0.1 K, which is significantly lower than ignoring the near -surface atmospheric influence. Our further analysis suggests that single-layer meteorological parameters can only be used when the installation height difference between the meteorological sensor and the long-wave radiometer is within 3 m. Since the correction method relies on readily available meteorological data, further research should focus on the generalizable coefficients or strategy for atmospheric correction to enhance the accuracy of radiation-based in-situ measured LST.

AB Sea fog can lead to a dangerous meteorological hazard over oceans and coastal areas. Cloud-aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) is an effective tool to detect sea fog, however it is ineffective for dense fog detection because the lidar signal has been fully attenuated before reaching the layer base. To address this issue by improving dense fog detection, a reanalysis-aided sea fog detection method using CALIOP lidar measurements and MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset is proposed taking the Northwestern Pacific (NP) as study area. In this method, CALIOP lidar measurements are used to locate the ceiling and base of the hydrometeor layers, and extract the candidate fog layers in the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL). Reanalysis dataset are used to identify real fog from the candidate fog layers based on the near-surface meteorological difference under different weather conditions (sea fog, stratus and stratus precipitation). Method validation using in-situ weather records from the International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) and five climate stations, shows the detection accuracy and false alarm rate of 89.4% and 2.0%, respectively. Most importantly, about 87.4% of dense fogs are successfully discriminated with the aid of reanalysis data. Model application to CALIOP data from 2007 to 2019 shows pronounced spatial and seasonal characteristics of sea fog distribution over NP, with the highest frequency (>40%) found over the Kuril Islands, Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea from June to August. The example demonstrates that by using time series CALIOP observations and the proposed method, one may expect spatiotemporally complete sea fog information, which is important especially for remote regions with scarce in-situ measurements (e.g. polar regions). Our research proposes and proves a novel idea of sea fog detection from space by using satellite lidar and reanalysis data, which may benefit the sea fog forecasting and dynamics analysis, by providing unprecedented large-scale high-quality observations, especially over dense fog conditions.

Although planting dates have high variation at local scales due to heterogeneity in farm resources and decision-making, available long-term data on planting dates are largely restricted to aggregated regional statistics or, at best, satellite-derived datasets with limited spatiotemporal extent and at resolutions unable to distinguish individual fields. Here, we generated retrospective annual field-scale (30 m) planting date maps for both maize and soy-beans spanning 2000-2020 across a 12-state region in the United States Corn Belt based on Landsat satellite data and a large ground sample of over 28,000 maize and soybean fields. Using training data from 2015 to 2020 for model selection, we found that planting date predictions improved with harmonic regression of Landsat data and additional annual weather covariates. The preferred random forest model approximately doubled performance compared to a null model based on state median planting dates, capturing 47% of field-level variation for maize (mean absolute error, MAE = 7.4 days) and 44% for soybeans (MAE = 7.5 days) against held-out ground truth test data for 2008-2014. We also evaluated the full 2000-2020 dataset with state agricultural statistics, finding strong agreement with median planting dates for maize (R-2 = 0.76, MAE = 4.4 days) and slightly lower agreement for soybeans (R-2 = 0.65, MAE = 5.4 days) when aggregated to the state level. We then used this new dataset to analyze environmental determinants of planting dates at a finer-scale than previously possible, con-trolling for unobserved variation at the sub-state district level. We found that during 2000-2020, each standard deviation increase in early-season rainfall delayed planting by similar to 2.5 days, and fields with higher soil productivity ratings tended to be planted earlier. We did not find meaningful trends over the last two decades in planting dates for maize or soybeans, in contrast to trends towards earlier planting dates late last century and predicted for this period in climate adaptation studies. We hypothesize increases in early season rainfall or persisting early -season frost risks may have inhibited these shifts towards earlier planting. Remotely sensed planting dates will be a useful tool for yield gap analyses, crop simulation modeling, and ongoing assessment of climate adaptation.

AB Forest age is an important variable for assessments of biodiversity and habitat, sustainable forest and land management, as well as forest carbon science and modeling. Tree and stand age are typically measured directly on site, or estimated through visual photo interpretation, with spatially explicit maps of forest age not often produced over large areas. Remote sensing enables the generation of wall-to wall, spatially explicit maps of disturbance events within the satellite record; however, as disturbance is relatively rare on the landscape in a given year, additional means of determining forest age are required. As reviewed herein, the estimation of forest age using optical Earth observation data is challenging due to the limited spectral link to the attribute of interest, especially as forests get older. The temporally dictated multi-method approach to forest age estimation outlined herein acknowledges these limitations, by applying the approach that is best suited to the quality of the infor-mation available, depending on the epoch of interest. In this research, we combine three approaches to estimate forest age at a 30-m spatial resolution using Landsat data. The first approach uses change detection protocols to detect disturbance from 1985 to 2019, with time since disturbance used as a proxy for forest age. The second approach uses Landsat surface reflectance composites to identify pixels exhibiting evidence of recovery from a disturbance that occurred within the twenty years prior to 1985, allowing for the extension of forest age esti-mates to 1965. Finally, given an understanding of the linkage between forest age and canopy height, inverted allometric equations are coupled with maps of forest structure and productivity metrics to model forest age for those pixels that show no evidence of disturbance or recovery to a maximum of 150 years, acknowledging that uncertainty in age estimate increases with increasing age. Combining these three approaches, forest age esti-mates are made for every treed pixel found within the 650 Mha forested ecosystems of Canada. Nationwide, mean estimated forest age for forests <= 150 years old (representing 94.1% of treed area) was 70 years (standard deviation = 32.1 years). For confidence building, forest age estimates were compared to reported forest age in the National Forest Inventory (NFI) both spatially and aspatially. Nationally, 5.9% of the forested area was estimated to be older than 150 years, while 9.5% of area within in the NFI sample was recorded as older than 150 years. The median estimated forest age for forested pixels <= 150 years old was 68 years while median forest age reported in the NFI was 73 years, with regional variability matching expectations related to disturbance regimes and productivity. Spatially explicit maps of forest age provide important information for understanding forest ecosystems and can be used to inform a wide range of policy, science, and management needs.

AB The maximum Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) carboxylation rate (Vcmax) has been widely used to help determine the photosynthetic capacity for carbon cycle modelling. Field measurements of Vcmax are very limited, so fixed Vcmax values over growing seasons are often used, causing considerable uncertainties in modelled results. Also, the lack of a global Vcmax dataset with seasonal variations limits our understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of Vcmax, and hence photosynthesis. This study proposes a refined data assimilation scheme to retrieve daily Vcmax using remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) data. Using the refined method, we produced a global Vcmax dataset with daily 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees resolutions. The seasonal variations in Vcmax have been successfully retrieved. Vcmax retrieved in this study was compared with field-measured Vcmax from past literature. Good agreements were achieved in relation to Vcmax measured at 201 sites (R2 is 0.78, and relative RMSE is 34%) and the seasonal variation in Vcmax measured at 9 sites (R2 ranges from 0.57 to 0.99, and the relative RMSE ranged from 6% to 28%). Our method effectively utilizes the information from both SIF and LCC, showing advantages over previous approaches that estimate Vcmax based solely on using SIF or LCC. Our results suggest that the spatial distribution of Vcmax depends on the spatial distribution of biomes, along with air temperature and absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). Higher seasonal mean air temperature and APAR tend to lead to higher seasonal mean Vcmax. The seasonal variation in Vcmax is driven by the seasonal variations in air temperature and APAR, rather than their seasonal means. We also derived and analyzed Vcmax25, which is Vcmax normalized to 25 degrees C (Vcmax25) and has been found to be more closely related to the Rubisco content. Vcmax25 also has considerable spatiotemporal variations, and the variations differ to that in Vcmax. Different biomes have different ratios of Vcmax25 to LCC. Air temperature and APAR exert weak but positive effects on the seasonal variation in Vcmax25. Vcmax retrieved in this study enhances our understanding of the spatiotemporal pattern of leaf photosynthetic capacity on the global scale and is potentially useful to terrestrial carbon cycle modelling.

AB The correction of the atmospheric effects on optical satellite images is essential for quantitative and multi -temporal remote sensing applications. In order to study the performance of the state-of-the-art methods in an integrated way, a voluntary and open-access benchmark Atmospheric Correction Inter-comparison eXercise (ACIX) was initiated in 2016 in the frame of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV). The first exercise was extended in a second edition wherein twelve at-mospheric correction (AC) processors, a substantially larger testing dataset and additional validation metrics were involved. The sites for the inter-comparison analysis were defined by investigating the full catalogue of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites for coincident measurements with satellites' overpass. Although there were more than one hundred sites for Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 acquisitions, the analysis presented in this paper concerns only the common matchups amongst all processors, reducing the number to 79 and 62 sites respectively. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Water Vapour (WV) retrievals were consequently validated based on the available AERONET observations. The processors mostly succeeded in retrieving AOD for relatively light to medium aerosol loading (AOD < 0.2) with uncertainties <0.08, while the overall uncertainty values were typically 0.23 +/- 0.15. Better performances were observed for WV retrievals with >90% of the results falling within the suggested empirical specifications and with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) being mostly <0.25 g/cm2. Regarding Surface Reflectance (SR) validation two main approaches were followed. For the first one, a simulated SR reference dataset was computed over all of the test sites by using the 6SV (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum vector code) full radiative transfer modelling (RTM) and AERONET measurements for the required aerosol variables and water vapour content. The performance assessment demonstrated that the retrievals were not biased for most of the bands. The uncertainties ranged from approximately 0.003 to 0.01 (excluding B01) for the best performing processors in both sensors' analyses. For the second one, measurements from the radiometric calibration network RadCalNet over La Crau (France) and Gobabeb (Namibia) were involved in the validation. The performance of the processors was in general consistent across all bands for both sensors and with low standard deviations (<0.04) between on-site and estimated surface reflectance. Overall, our study provides a good insight of AC algorithms' performance to developers and users, pointing out similarities and differences for AOD, WV and SR retrievals. Such validation though still lacks of ground-based measurements of known uncertainty to better assess and characterize the uncertainties in SR retrievals.

AB Vegetation optical depth (VOD) is seasonally sensitive to plant water content and aboveground biomass. This index has a strong penetrability within the vegetation canopy and is less impacted by atmosphere aerosol contamination effects, clouds and sun illumination than optical vegetation indices. VOD is thus increasingly applied in ecological applications, e.g., carbon stock, phenology and vegetation monitoring. However, VOD retrieval over dense forests is subject to uncertainties caused by the thick canopy and complex multiple scattering effects. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of VOD products over dense forests is needed for effective and accurate applications. This study evaluated the seasonal variations of eight recently developed/reprocessed VOD products at different frequencies (e.g., Ku-, X-, C-and L-band) over Amazon intact forests, supported by the ORCHIDEE-CAN-NHA model-simulated vegetation water content. Furthermore, we also explored the potential causes of VOD retrieval issues, in terms of retrieval algorithm uncertainties. We first confirmed that soil water availability dominated seasonal dynamics of vegetation water content over Amazon intact forests. This was verified by model-simulated vegetation water content and by C-band radar backscatter observations. Generally, evening or midday vegetation water content shows higher correlations with soil moisture than morning or midnight vegetation water content. In terms of ability of morning or midnight VOD products to follow the seasonality of soil moisture, active microwave ASCAT-IB C-VOD (median seasonal cor-relation with soil moisture (R) -0.50) outperforms the passive microwave VOD products, followed by passive microwave AMSR2 X-VOD (R -0.26) and VODCA X-VOD (R -0.16). However, SMOS-IC L-VOD (R --0.15)and AMSR2 C1-VOD (R --0.20)show obviously negative seasonal correlations with soil moisture across most pixels. This implausible behavior is likely to be caused by the inappropriate setting of time-invariant scattering effects in the passive microwave VOD retrieval algorithms, which could lead to an overestimation of the VOD amplitude during dry seasons. Thus, we recommend that the seasonal scattering effects be considered in the passive microwave VOD retrieval algorithms. These findings can contribute to the improvement of VOD retrieval algorithms and help with the development of their ecological applications over Amazon dense forests.

AB "Whiting" events in the Bahama Banks, due to high concentrations of carbonate-rich particles suspended in the water, have been reported and discussed widely in the past 80 years. However, little is known about their distributions and particularly about their long-term changes. Here, using a deep learning (DL) model, we objectively delineate and quantify whiting features from Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite images (250-m resolution) and establish an 18-year data record (2003-2020) of whiting occurrences in the Bahama Banks. Both the Great Bahama Bank (GBB) and the Little Bahama Bank (LBB) show clear seasonality in whiting areas, where a primary peak in spring and a secondary peak in winter are found in the GBB but only one peak in winter is found in the LBB. Such a seasonality may be explained using a hydrodynamic hypothesis on calcium carbonate precipitation. The mean size of individual whiting patches in the GBB is about 2.4 +/- 6.1 km2 (-0.1 to 226 km2), while in the LBB is 1.4 +/- 2.7 km2 (-0.1 to 95 km2). The total whiting coverage in a typical cloud-free image is 87.1 km2 in the GBB and 32.0 km2 in the LBB, representing 0.14% and 0.76% of the entire GBB and LBB, respectively. Significant increases in the mean coverage have been found in the GBB since 2011, with peak coverage (-200 km2) in 2013-2015 being at least 4 times higher than before (20-70 km2). Although the whiting area started to decrease after 2015, it did not reach the pre-2011 level until 2020. On the other hand, correlation analysis and principal component analysis of several environmental factors (pH, light, salinity, carbonate, aragonite, winds, currents) provided some hints on which factors may have contributed. From these, we infer a potential 'Goldilocks' scenario, whereby decreases in pH and carbonate concentration, concomitant with increases in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and current speeds, created conditions increasingly favorable for whitings from 2011 to 2015. Continuation of these environmental trends after 2015, however, resulted in conditions increasingly unfavorable for whiting formation, yet without field-based measurements it is difficult to conclude the potential reasons for increases and decreases of whiting formation in the GBB.

AB High spatial resolution land surface temperature (LST, <100 m) is crucial for agricultural water management, crop water stress monitoring, fire mapping, urban heat island study and volcano eruption detection. LST re-trievals from the ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) launched in June 2018, together with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER, launched in 1999) and the Landsat series (since 1972), comprise the state-of-the-art high spatial res-olution LST datasets publicly accessible. Recently, we generated the ECOSTRESS LST product over Europe and Africa using both the temperature and emissivity separation (TES) and split-window (SW) algorithms under the European ECOSTRESS Hub (EEH). Here, we validated the official Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) TES (Collection 1), EEH TES and EEH SW ECOSTRESS LST products over Europe and Africa between August 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021 by comparing against the in-situ measurements at 9 sites over a wide variety of land cover types. Meanwhile, the validation results were compared with those obtained for ASTER and Landsat LST at the same sites for a thorough understanding of the consistency among these high spatial resolution LST products. The results reveal that the three ECOSTRESS LST products have consistent performances, with an overall RMSE around 2 K. A cold bias around 1 K exists for all three ECOSTRESS LST, which is presumably originated from the radiometric calibration of the sensor in Collection 1 data. The Landsat LST shows a similar accuracy, with an RMSE of 2.20 K and bias of 0.54 K. The EEHSW LST show the highest consistency with Landsat LST, possibly due to the identical emissivity correction process. The performance of ASTER LST is also similar, with an RMSE of 1.98 K and bias of 0.9 K. The precisions of all the LST products are around 1.5 K. Future recalibration of the ECOSTRESS Level 1 radiance data in Collection 2 is expected to further improve the accuracy of ECOSTRESS LST. Overall, this study supports the adaptation of LST retrieval algorithms for the future thermal missions.

AB We propose a physically-based methodology for sea-surface skin-temperature (SST) retrievals from daytime spectra recorded by the hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). The approach, which takes sun light into account, minimizes the differences between measured and computed radiances at numerous points within two windows centered near 3.7 and 4.0 mu m. We demonstrate that, even when the solar contribution is large, with brightness temperatures increased by several tens of kelvin at the shortest wavelengths, very consistent SSTs are retrieved in both windows. Furthermore, the values obtained are, after correction for the cool-skin effect, in excellent agreement (<0.05 K on average) with the in-situ measurements of the depth temperature provided by nearby drifters. This opens renewed perspectives for daytime SST determinations from space, since the IASI mid-infrared windows used here provide SSTs that are, with respect to those retrieved around 9 and 11 mu m, much less sensitive to errors in the computed radiative contribution of water vapor.

AB Advances in remote sensing imagery and machine learning applications unlock the potential for developing algorithms for species classification at the level of individual tree crowns at unprecedented scales. However, most approaches to date focus on site-specific applications and a small number of taxonomic groups. Little is known about how well these approaches generalize across broader geographic areas and ecosystems. Leveraging field surveys and hyperspectral remote sensing data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), we developed a continental-extent model for tree species classification that can be applied to the network, including a wide range of US terrestrial ecosystems. We compared the performance of a model trained with data from 27 NEON sites to models trained with data from each individual site, evaluating advantages and challenges posed by training species classifiers at the US scale. We evaluated the effect of geographic location, topography, and ecological conditions on the accuracy and precision of species predictions (72 out of 77 species).On average, the general model resulted in good overall classification accuracy (micro-F1 score), with better accuracy than site-specific classifiers (average individual tree level accuracy of 0.77 for the general model and 0.70 for site-specific models). Aggregating species to the genus-level increased accuracy to 0.83. Regions with more species exhibited lower classification accuracy. Predicted species were more likely to be confused with congeneric and co-occurring species and confusion was highest for trees with structural damage and in complex closed-canopy forests. The model produced accurate estimates of uncertainty, correctly identifying trees where confusion was likely. Using only data from NEON, this single integrated classifier can make predictions for 20% of all tree species found in forest ecosystems across the entire US, which make up to roughly 90% of the upper canopy of the studied ecosystems. This suggests the potential for integrating information from multiple datasets and locations to develop broad scale general models for species classification from hyperspectral imaging.

AB Ecosystem primary productivity is a key ecological process influencing many ecosystem services, including carbon storage. Thus, clarifying how primary productivity in terrestrial ecosystems responds to climatic variability can reveal key mechanisms that will drive future changes in the global carbon budget. Satellite products of canopy greenness are widely used as proxies for vegetation productivity to evaluate how ecosystems respond to climate variability. However, to what degree inter-annual variations in productivity are consistent with greenness and how this relationship varies spatially remains unclear. Here we investigated the strength of the coupling between inter-annual variations in leaf area index (LAI, a measure of greenness) and ecosystem gross primary productivity (GPP) derived from eddy covariance towers, i.e., the r(2) of the LAI-GPP relationship. Overall, inter-annual GPP and LAI were highly coupled (i.e., high r(2)) in arid grasslands, but were fully decoupled in mesic evergreen broadleaf forests, indicating that this relationship varies strongly along aridity gradients. A possible mechanism of the spatial variation in the LAI-GPP relationship is that the tradeoff between ecosystem structure (LAI) and physiology (photosynthesis per unit leaf area) becomes stronger in more humid climates. Land models overestimated the r(2) of LAI-GPP correlation for most ecosystem types and failed to capture the spatial pattern along aridity gradients. We conclude that relying on greenness products for evaluating inter-annual changes in vegetation productivity may bias assessments, especially in tropical rainforest ecosystems. Our findings may also reconcile observed disparities between responses in greenness and GPP during drought in Amazon forests.

AB The clumping effect is the main issue causing the heterogeneity in vegetation canopies and the underestimation of leaf area index (LAI) obtained using indirect measurement methods. Significant efforts have been exerted to correct for the clumping effect and derive the true LAI. Recent research has shown that the fractal dimension (FD) is directly related to the clumping effect of foliage, yet practical methods are needed to calculate field estimates. Considering that widely used LAI applications such as digital hemispherical photography (DHP), tracing radiation and architecture of canopies (TRAC), and digital cover photography (DCP) estimate LAI with one-dimensional (1D) gap probability and gap size data, we propose a method to correct for the clumping effect using 1D FD. Resulting formulae describing the relationship between LAI, CI, and 1D FD were based on the box-counting method (BCM) and a binomial distribution model. Sixty-four simulated scenes including four RAdiation transfer Model Intercomparison (RAMI) actual canopies and field measurements from nine plots (four orchard plots and five coniferous forest plots) were used to validate the novel method. Results showed good agreement with reference LAI values for simulated scenes (R2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 0.35). The 1DFD method generated higher LAI estimates compared with the LAI measured using TRAC at the four orchard plots especially at high canopy closure, while its results were more consistent with LAI obtained by litter collection than those of comparable methods at coniferous forest plots (bias from-13.5% to 9.9% for DCP images, from-3.0% to 19.7% for DHP images, and from-3.8% to 17.0% for TRAC transects). Our validation efforts indicate that the method proposed herein corrects for the clumping effect of vegetated canopies more effectively with DCP images, DHP images, and TRAC measurement when compared with traditional indirect optical methods. The 1DFD method is expected to improve indirect measurement accuracy of LAI.

AB Passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture is an underdetermined problem, as observed microwave emission from the landscape is affected by a variety of unknown surface parameters. Increasing observation information is an effective means to make retrievals more robust. In this study, a multi-temporal and multi-angular (MTMA) approach is proposed using SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite L-band data for retrieving vegetation optical depth (VODp, p indicates the polarization with H for horizontal and V for ver-tical)), effective scattering albedo (omega(eff)(p)), soil surface roughness (Z(p)(s)), and soil moisture (SMp). The advantage of the MTMA approach is that it does not need auxiliary data as inputs or constraints. SMOS polarization-dependent VOD are produced and compared at a global scale for the first time, and it is found that the polarization dif-ference of vegetation effects should not be ignored in the SM retrieval algorithm. The MTMA VOD retrievals are found to have a reasonable global spatial distribution, which is generally consistent with the VOD retrievals obtained from the SMOS Level 3 (SMOS-L3) and SMOS-IC Version 2 (V2) (referred to as SMOS-IC), except for showing relatively lower values over densely vegetated areas compared with the other two SMOS products. The spatial distribution of retrieved omega(eff)(p) generally shows a dependence on both VOD and land cover types. In addition, the values of MTMA-omega(eff)(V) are higher than that of MTMA-omega(eff)(H), indicating stronger microwave scattering of V-pol in the vegetation layer than that of H-pol. The retrieved surface roughness parameter (Z(p)(s)) ranges from 0.04 to 0.22 cm, and its spatial distribution is partially different from the existing roughness products/auxiliary data from SMOS and SMAP. The retrieved MTMA SM shows generally high correlations with in-situ measurements (11 dense observation networks) with overall correlation coefficients of > 0.75. The overall ubRMSE of MTMA-SMH and MTMA-SMV are < 0.055 m(3)/m(3) and lower than that of SMOS-IC and SMOS-L3 products. SMOS-IC generally presents higher correlation coefficients compared to MTMA in most sites outside China; in China, RFI filtering is crucial and makes it very difficult when comparing algorithms based on different brightness temperature products. The number of effective retrievals of MTMA-SMH and MTMA-SMV ranges from 1409 to 1640 and 1104 to 1603 respectively, which is more than that from SMOS-IC (from 236 to 1358) over the selected 11 networks. Therefore, it is concluded that by incorporating multi-temporal SMOS data, the proposed method of MTMA can be used to systematically retrieve SM, VOD and additional surface parameters (effective scattering albedo and surface roughness) with comparable or better performance of SM than that of SMOS-IC and SMOS-L3. Moreover, this paper for the first time produced a polarization-dependent SMOS VOD product at a global scale.

AB Understanding the sources of error that affect the accuracy of current coarse burned area products is crucial to identifying weaknesses and limitations of burned area (BA) algorithms. In this paper, we propose methods to analyse sources of errors of global BA products, which are applied to assess a widely used product, (FireCCI51), created under the ESA climate change initiative programme. The effect of several variables related to product accuracy are quantified by comparing the FireCCI51 BA product with a large global reference BA dataset for the years 2017-2019. These reference data were obtained from multitemporal analysis of Landsat-8 data. Error maps (commission and omission error layers) were generated for a sample of 316 units (100 km x 100 km) and as-sociations between errors and potential explanatory sources of error were spatially analysed to provide a comprehensive error assessment of the FireCCI51 product. Active fire density, burned severity, burned patch size and land cover class were selected as explanatory variables for omission and commission errors. The results indicated that the largest contribution to the commission errors (70-80%) was related to the pixel size, partic-ularly when pixels are only partially burned. Active fire densities were also associated to error distribution, with higher densities from products derived from the VIIRS sensors versus those generated from MODIS, indicating the potential benefit of the former as an alternative source in upcoming BA algorithms. Burn severity was also associated with error distribution, but this relation varied substantially across biomes. Land cover was also related to errors, with lowest accuracies for croplands with omission error percentages > 85%. Fire size and, to a lesser extent, the shape of burned areas also played a crucial role in determining the accuracy of the BA products. BA accuracy increased for larger and more compact burned patches. Although our results suggest that further improvement of global BA products is possible, they also indicate that the ability of coarse spatial resolution BA sensors to meet the accuracy recommendations of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) programme is limited.

AB Although generally given little attention in vegetation studies, ground-dwelling (terricolous) lichens are major contributors to overall carbon and nitrogen cycling, albedo, biodiversity and biomass in many high-latitude ecosystems. Changes in biomass of mat-forming pale lichens have the potential to affect vegetation, fauna, climate and human activities including reindeer husbandry. Lichens have a complex spectral signature and terricolous lichens have limited growth height, often growing in mixtures with taller vegetation. This has, so far, prevented the development of remote sensing techniques to accurately assess lichen biomass, which would be a powerful tool in ecosystem and ecological research and rangeland management. We present a Landsat based remote sensing model developed using deep neural networks, trained with 8914 field records of lichen volume collected for > 20 years. In contrast to earlier proposed machine learning and regression methods for lichens, our model exploited the ability of neural networks to handle mixed spatial resolution input. We trained candidate models using input of 1 x 1 (30 x 30 m) and 3 x 3 Landsat pixels based on 7 reflective bands and 3 indices, combined with a 10 m spatial resolution digital elevation model. We normalised elevation data locally for each plot to remove the region-specific variation, while maintaining informative local variation in topography. The final model predicted lichen volume in an evaluation set (n = 159) reaching an R2 of 0.57. NDVI and elevation were the most important predictors, followed by the green band. Even with moderate tree cover density, the model was efficient, offering a considerable improvement compared to earlier methods based on specific reflectance. The model was in principle trained on data from Scandinavia, but when applied to sites in North America and Russia, the predictions of the model corresponded well with our visual interpretations of lichen abundance. We also accurately quantified a recent historic (35 years) change in lichen abundance in northern Norway. This new method enables further spatial and temporal studies of variation and changes in lichen biomass related to multiple research questions as well as rangeland management and economic and cultural ecosystem services. Combined with information on changes in drivers such as climate, land use and management, and air pollution, our model can be used to provide accurate estimates of ecosystem changes and to improve vegetation-climate models by including pale lichens.

AB For the past three decades, polar-orbiting ocean color satellites have provided local, regional to global scale estimates of oceanic net primary production that have greatly aided studies of ocean carbon cycling, food web dynamics and climate change. Despite considerable progress, accurate estimates of daily ocean productivity from space have not been realized because polar-orbiting satellites are unable to account for variations in phyto-plankton physiology and carbon fixation rates from changing incident irradiance levels over the course of the day. Here we have attempted to exploit the unique short-temporal measurements provided by the Korean Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI), to obtain for the first time, diurnal and daily measurements of sur- face-and euphotic-column integrated Net Primary Productivity (NPP). These estimates are based on the Ab-sorption Based Productivity Model (AbPM), and are calibrated with a bio-optical database of measurements made at different times of the day during the Korea-US Ocean Color (KORUS-OC) cruise in May-June 2016. Photo-physiological rate estimates, varied across different water types encountered around the Korean Peninsula, but on account of their limited number, were regionally scaled through the use of dynamic optical-biogeochemical (O-BGC) Biomes. Comparisons of GOCI derived estimates of daily and weekly integrated NPP against in-situ measurements, clearly underscore the superiority of geostationary over polar-orbiting ocean color satellites, which consider the strong short-term fluctuations in phytoplankton light absorption and incident irradiance fields over the course of the day.

AB An increase in the frequency and severity of disturbances (such as forest fires) is putting pressure on the resilience of the Amazon tropical forest; potentially leading to reduced ability to recover and to maintain a functioning forest ecosystem. Dense and long-term satellite time series approaches provide a largely untapped data source for characterizing disturbance- recovery forest dynamics across large areas and varying types of forests and conditions. Although large-scale forest recovery capacity metrics have been derived from optical satellite image time series and validated over various ecosystems, their sensitivity to disturbance (e.g. disturbance magnitude, disturbance timing, and recovery time) and environmental data characteristics (e.g. noise magnitude, seasonality, and missing values) are largely unknown. This study proposes an open source simulation framework based on the characteristics of sampled original satellite image time series to (i) compare the reliability of recovery metrics, (ii) evaluate their sensitivity with respect to environmental and disturbance characteristics, and (iii) evaluate the effect of pre-processing techniques on the reliability of the recovery metrics for abrupt disturbances, such as fires, in the Amazon basin forests. The effect of three pre-processing techniques were evaluated: changing the temporal resolution, noise removal techniques (such as time series smoothing and segmenting), and using a varying time span after the disturbance to calculate recovery metrics. Here, reliability is quantified by comparing derived and theoretical values of the recovery metrics (RMSE and R-2). From the three recovery metrics evaluated, the Year on Year Average (YrYr) and the Ratio of Eighty Percent (R80p) are more reliable than the Relative Recovery Index (RRI). Time series segmentation tends to improve the reliability of recovery metrics. Recovery metrics derived from temporal dense Landsat time series tend to show a higher reliability than those derived from time series aggregated to quarterly or annual values. Although the framework is demonstrated on Landsat time series of the Amazon tropical forest, it can be used to perform such test on other datasets and ecosystems.

AB Urbanization is the second largest mega-trend right after climate change. Accurate measurements of urban morphological and demographic figures are at the core of many international endeavors to address issues of urbanization, such as the United Nations' call for "Sustainable Cities and Communities". In many countries - particularly developing countries -, however, this database does not yet exist. Here, we demonstrate a novel deep learning and big data analytics approach to fuse freely available global radar and multi-spectral satellite data, acquired by the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Via this approach, we created the first-ever global and quality controlled urban local climate zones classification covering all cities across the globe with a population greater than 300,000 and made it available to the community (https://doi.org/10.14459/2021mp1633461). Statistical analysis of the data quantifies a global inequality problem: approximately 40% of the area defined as compact or light/large low-rise accommodates about 60% of the total population, whereas approximately 30% of the area defined as sparsely built accommodates only about 10% of the total population. Beyond, patterns of urban morphology were discovered from the global classification map, confirming a morphologic relationship to the geographical region and related cultural heritage. We expect the open access of our dataset to encourage research on the global change process of urbanization, as a multidisciplinary crowd of researchers will use this baseline for spatial perspective in their work. In addition, it can serve as a unique dataset for stakeholders such as the United Nations to improve their spatial assessments of urbanization.

ID SURFACE CURRENTS
AB Direct sensing of total ocean surface currents with microwave Doppler signals is a growing topic of interest for oceanography, with relevance to several new ocean mission concepts proposed in recent years. Since 2014, the spaceborne C-band SAR instruments of the Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) mission routinely acquire microwave Doppler data, distributed to users through operational S1 Level-2 ocean radial velocity (L2 OCN RVL) products. S1 L2 RVL data could produce high-resolution maps of ocean surface currents that would benefit ocean observing and modelling, particularly in coastal regions. However, uncorrected platform effects and instrument anomalies continue to impact S1 RVL data and prevent direct exploitation.
   In this paper, a simple empirical method is proposed to calibrate and correct operational S1 L2 RVL products and retrieve two-dimensional maps of surface currents in the radar line-of-sight. The study focuses on the German Bight where wind, wave and current data from marine stations and an HF radar instrumented site provide comprehensive means to evaluate S1 retrieved currents. Analyses are deliberately limited to Sentinel-1A (S1A) ascending passes to focus on one single instrument and fixed SAR viewing geometry. The final dataset comprises 78 separate S1A acquisitions over 2.5 years, of which 56 are matched with collocated HF radar data. The empirical corrections bring significant improvements to S1A RVL data, producing higher quality estimates and much better agreement with HF radar radial currents.
   Comparative evaluation of S1A against HF radar currents for different WASV corrections reveal that best results are obtained in this region when computing the WASV with sea state rather than wind vector input. Accounting for sea state produces S1 radial currents with a precision (std of the difference) around 0.3 m/s at similar to 1 km resolution. Precision improves to similar to 0.24 m/s when averaging over 21 x 27 km(2), with correlations with HF radar data reaching up to 0.93. Evidence of wind-current interactions when tides and wind align and short fetch conditions call for further research with more satellite data and other sites to better understand and correct the WASV in coastal regions.
   Finally, 1 km resolution maps of climatological S1A radial currents obtained over 2.5 years reveal strong coastal jets and fine scale details of the coastal circulation that closely match the known bathymetry and deep-water coastal channels in this region. The wealth of oceanographic information in corrected S1 RVL data is encouraging for Doppler oceanography from space and its application to observing small scale ocean dynamics, atmosphere and ocean vertical exchanges and marine ecosystem response to environmental change.

AB In old-growth forests, natural disturbances form a complex mosaic of structures, providing a wide diversity of habitats and functions of great importance. Old-growth forests are still often seen as a homogeneous whole and few remote-sensing approaches have been tested to identify their structural diversity, especially in boreal forests. The aim of this study is to use a combination of airborne LiDAR and satellite imagery to identify and discriminate old-growth forest structures resulting from different disturbance histories. The study area, which was located in the mixed boreal forest of Quebec (Canada), is Monts Valin National Park and adjacent managed territories. Balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill) is the dominant species in the study area, but hardwood species such as white birch (Betula pcupyrifera Marsh.) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) can also be abundant in the early succession stages. Four forest classes were studied: second-growth (logged between 1970 and 1980); transition old-growth (burned in 1920); undisturbed old-growth (unburned for at least 125 years); and disturbed old-growth forest (unburned for at least 125 years, but severely disturbed by an insect outbreak around 1980). A multivariate Random Forest model was used to discriminate the classes on 6466 1 ha tiles, based on 11 complementary LiDAR and satellite-derived indices describing stand vertical and horizontal structure, together with "greenness" and disturbance history over the last 30 years. This model had high predictive efficiency (AUC = 94.2), with 81.8% of the tiles accurately classified. Interestingly, undisturbed old-growth forests exhibited intermediate characteristics compared to transition and disturbed old-growth forests. This emphasizes that some structural attributes recognized as important for the classification of temperate and tropical old-growth forests, such as high vertical complexity, are of lesser relevance for boreal old-growth forests. In comparison to undisturbed old-growth forests, transition old-growth forests had a taller canopy of high "greenness" due to a greater hardwood abundance; disturbed old-growth forests had a higher gap fraction and heterogeneity in tree size; second-growth forests exhibited a lower and more even canopy. Misclassified tiles were explained by spatial variation in disturbance severity or different levels of forest resistance and resilience to disturbance. These misclassifications are also of ecological interest, as they highlight the nuances in structural diversity that are rarely identified by disturbance mapping. A reasonable combination of LiDAR and satellite indices was effective not only in discriminating old-growth forests from second-growth forests, but also identifying their different structures, which result from specific disturbance histories. This method could contribute to effective monitoring of changes in the areas and characteristics old-growth forest that are caused by anthropogenic and natural disturbances.

AB Although satellite-based light use efficiency (LUE) model is widely used to estimate gross primary production (GPP) of terrestrial ecosystems, microwave observations have not been integrated into LUE models. This study developed a new LUE model coupled with a passive microwave vegetation index (Emissivity Difference Vegetation Index, EDVI) for daily GPP estimation. Normalized EDVI (nEDVI), an indicator of canopy-scale leaf development and biomass change, was used as a proxy of fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR). EDVI-based evaporative fraction (EDVI-EF) under all sky was used to indicate synoptic-scale water stress on LUE. 8-year in-situ measurements from seven flux tower sites (four forests, two grasslands and one croplands) of ChinaFLUX network were used to evaluate the model. We found that nEDVI-based FPAR better captured the short-term variations in daily in-situ GPP (GPPobs) than other optic-based FPAR schemes. This capability of nEDVI was more noticeable under moderate and heavy cloud cover (Frc) conditions. Validations against daily GPPobs at all sites showed that EDVI-based GPP (GPPEDVI) generated an overall small bias of -0.47 gC m- 2 day- 1 (-8.1%) and good Taylor score (S) of 0.86 at the daily scale. Better accuracy of GPPEDVI was found at forests sites with R2 of 0.43 to 0.73, bias of-5.29% to 3.03% and S of 0.58 to 0.78, respectively. At a tropical forest site with most frequent cloud cover, the model also well captured the variation in GPPobs from clear sky to cloudy sky (R2 of 0.93) with stable accuracies. Furthermore, the accuracy of daily GPPEDVI was found to be comparable with global satellite optic MOD17 GPP (GPPMOD17) and EC-LUE GPP (GPPECLUE) from 8-day to yearly scales across the sites. In particular, GPPEDVI performed generally smaller bias at evergreen broadleaf forests, while both of GPPMOD17 and GPPECLUE were overestimated, suggesting that there could be less saturation for microwave-based LUE model over dense vegetation. Although all three satellite LUE models severely underestimated GPP of crop, GPPEDVI generated lower bias (-29.8%) than GPPMOD17 (-66.8%) and GPPECLUE (-59.5%). Overall, this study is the first attempt toward the integration of microwave-derived variables into LUE model for daily GPP estimation. The microwave-based LUE model has a potential of mapping spatiotemporally continues daily GPP under various clouds.

AB Annual global land cover maps (GLC) are being provided by several operational monitoring efforts. However, map validation is lagging, in the sense that the annual land cover maps are often not validated. Concurrently, users such as the climate and land management community require information on the temporal consistency of multi-date GLC maps and stability in their accuracy. In this study, we propose a framework for operational validation of annual global land cover maps using efficient means for updating validation datasets that allow timely map validation according to recommendations in the CEOS Stage-4 validation guidelines. The framework includes a regular update of a validation dataset and continuous map validation. For the regular update of a validation dataset, a partial revision of the validation dataset based on random and targeted rechecking (areas with a high probability of change) is proposed followed by additional validation data collection. For continuous map validation, an accuracy assessment of each map release is proposed including an assessment of stability in map accuracy addressing the user needs on the temporal consistency information of GLC map and map quality. This validation approach was applied to the validation of the Copernicus Global Land Service GLC product (CGLS-LC100). The CGLS-LC100 global validation dataset was updated from 2015 to 2019. The update was done through a partial revision of the validation dataset and an additional collection of sample validation sites. From the global validation dataset, a total of 40% (10% for each update year) was revisited, supplemented by a targeted revision focusing on validation sample locations that were identified as possibly changed using the BFAST time series algorithm. Additionally, 6720 sample sites were collected to represent possible land cover change areas within 2015 and 2019. Through this updating mechanism, we increased the sampling intensity of validation sample sites in possible land cover change areas within the period. Next, the dataset was used to validate the annual GLC maps of the CGLS-LC100 product for 2015-2019. The results showed that the CGLS-LC100 annual GLC maps have about 80% overall accuracy showing high temporal consistency in general. In terms of stability in class accuracy, herbaceous wetland class showed to be the least stable over the period. As more operational land cover monitoring efforts are upcoming, we emphasize the importance of updated map validation and recommend improving the current validation practices and guidelines towards operational map validation so that long-term land cover maps and their uncertainty information are well understood and properly used.

AB Landslides are common geohazards associated with natural drivers such as precipitation, land degradation, toe erosion by rivers and wave attack, and ground shaking. On the other hand, human alterations such as inundation by water impoundment or rapid drawdown may also destabilize the surrounding slopes. The Guobu slope is an ancient rockslide on the banks of the Laxiwa hydropower station reservoir (China), which reactivated during the reservoir impoundment in 2009. We extracted three-dimensional surface displacements with azimuth and range radar interferometry using European Space Agency's Copernicus Sentinel-1 and German Aerospace Center's TerraSAR-X data during 20152019. The upper part of the Guobu rockslide is characterized by toppling and is mostly subsiding with maximum rates over 0.4 m/yr and 0.7 m/yr in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. During filling of the reservoir prior to 2014, there was a long-wavelength in-phase response between rising reservoir level and GPS-observed increased slope movements. After the reservoir water level stabilized from 2015 to 2019, the slide movement became seasonal and we see a correlation between rainfall and landslide movement. These observations suggest that the slide motion is now primarily controlled by rainfall. The spatiotemporal landslide displacements allow us to estimate the hydraulic diffusivity of the rock mass, to be on the order (similar to 1.05 x 10(-7) m(2)/s) and the thickness of the moving rock mass (similar to 200 m). Our results demonstrate that InSAR is a useful tool for monitoring the rockslide movement as a function of seasonal precipitation.

AB Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from spaceborne sensors is a promising tool for global carbon cycle monitoring, but its application is constrained by insufficient understanding of the drivers underlying diurnal SIF dynamics. SIF measurements from ground-based towers can reveal diurnal SIF dynamics across biomes and environmental conditions; however, meaningful interpretation of diurnal variations requires disentangling impacts from canopy structure, plant physiology, instrument configuration and retrieval methods, which often interact with and confound each other. This study aims to unpack these drivers using 1) concurrent ground and airborne canopy-scale and leaf-scale measurements at a corn field, 2) a mechanistic SIF model that explicitly considers the dynamics of photochemistry (via the fraction of open photosystem II reaction centers, qL) and photoprotection (via nonphotochemical quenching, NPQ) as well as their interactive dependence on the sub canopy light environment, and 3) cross-comparison of SIF instrument configurations and retrieval methods. We found that crop row orientations and sun angles can introduce a distinctive midday dip in SIF in absence of stress, due to a midday drop of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) when crop rows are north south oriented. Canopy structure caused distinctive responses in both qL and NPQ at different positions within the vertical canopy that collectively influenced fluorescence quantum yield (Phi(F)) at the leaf scale. Once integrated at the canopy scale, diurnal dynamics of both APAR and canopy escape probability (epsilon) are critical for accurately shaping diurnal SIF variations. While leaf-level qL and NPQ exhibited strong diurnal dynamics, their influence was attenuated at the canopy scale due to opposing effects on SIF at different canopy layers. Furthermore, different system configurations (i.e., bi-hemispherical vs. hemispherical-conical) and retrieval methods can bias the SIF magnitude and distort its diurnal shapes, therefore confounding the interpretation of inherent strength and dynamics of SIF emission. Our findings demonstrate the importance of crop row structures, interactive variations in canopy structure and plant physiology, instrument configuration, and retrieval method in shaping the measured dynamics of diurnal SIF. This study highlights the necessity to account for these factors to accurately interpret satellite SIF, and informs future synthesis work with different SIF instrumentation and retrieval methods across sites.

AB Identification of materials based on spectral reflectance is confounded by variations in reflectance magnitude that are independent of the spectral shape. Local variations such as viewing/illumination angles, multiscale soil surface roughness that causes shadows and redistributes light, and soil moisture content, all drive changes in magnitude that are distinct from the spectral variations, and complicate identification and modeling of targets based on spectral features. Normalization metrics that remove magnitude variations can greatly clarify the nature of spectral differences, simplifying interpretation of reflectance features in spectral imagery. Normalized difference measures are particularly useful because of the simplicity of the computation, the convenient scaling, and the ease with which the normalized difference procedure can be extended to multiple dimensions. The twodimensional normalized difference space described here allows for improved discrimination among bare soils and emergent vegetation when there are multiple soil types in the scene. A 2-D model of soil-specific change in vegetation density is presented. An application of the vector index to mineral identification and mapping is also presented, with an emphasis on band selection.

AB Fog-driven epiphyte-rich tropical cloud forests were long believed to be restricted to mountainous regions. Recent studies have shown the occurrence of such forest types in the lowlands of French Guiana, where early morning radiation fog was shown to modify the water and energy cycles at the canopy level of the tropical lowland rain forest (Gehrig-Downie et al., 2012; Obregon et al., 2011). Since this newly discovered Tropical Lowland Cloud Forest (TLCF) harbours a unique biodiversity comparable to mountain cloud forests, knowledge of its spatial distribution across tropical lowland forests is of large ecological interest, but so far fully unknown. A prerequisite to detect potential TLCF stands is knowledge on the spatial occurrence of fog/low stratus clouds (FLS) over longer time scales, indicating fog frequency. We address this need on a continental scale by presenting the first spatially-explicit, high-resolution product on nocturnal FLS occurrence over the entire tropical lowland rain forest area of South America. The product is based on a new FLS retrieval scheme that uses brightness temperature (BT) information of night-time satellite images acquired by the Aqua Moderate Imaging Spectror-adiometer (Aqua MODIS). Since landforms substantially influence small-scale FLS development, we used a dy-namic threshold technique depending on the spatially variable subpixel information on landform suitability for FLS generation. The product was successfully validated against in-situ visibility measurements combined with a plausibility analysis based on the published but scarce fog observations over the Amazon. The independence of the new algorithm from measured total precipitable water (TPW) is an improvement over existing procedures that are limited to the availability of these ancillary data. The FLS frequency map for the entire tropical lowland forest of South America derived from over 52,000 scenes (18 years from 2003 to 2020 inclusive) indicates that FLS is widespread, though spatially differentiated, throughout the tropical lowland forests of South America, providing suitable environmental conditions for the TLCF. This knowledge on the spatial distribution of potential TLCF is of major importance for conservation efforts. The new FLS scheme is applicable to all tropical lowland forests and can therefore support global conservation efforts of the valuable TLCF ecosystems.

AB PlanetScope satellite data with a 3-m resolution and near-daily global coverage have been increasingly used for land surface monitoring, ranging from land cover change detection to vegetative biophysics characterization and ecological assessments. Similar to other satellite data, effective screening of clouds and cloud shadows in PlanetScope images is a prerequisite for these applications, yet remains challenging as PlanetScope has 1) fewer spectral bands than other satellites hindering the use of traditional methods, and 2) inconsistent radiometric calibration across satellite sensors making the cloud/shadow detection using fixed thresholds unrealistic. To address these challenges, we developed a SpatioTemporal Integration approach for Automatic Cloud and Shadow Screening ('STI-ACSS'), including two steps: (1) generating initial masks of clouds/shadows by integrating both spatial (i.e. cloud/shadow indices of an individual PlanetScope image) and temporal (i.e. reflectance outliers in PlanetScope image time series) information with an adaptive threshold approach; (2) a two-step fine-tuning on these initial masks to derive final masks by integrating morphological processing with an object-based cloud and cloud shadow matching. We tested STI-ACSS at six tropical sites representative of different land cover types (e.g. forest, urban, cropland, savannah, and shrubland). For each site, we evaluated the performance of STI-ACSS with reference to the manual masks of clouds/shadows, and compared it with four state-of-the-art methods, namely Function of mask (Fmask), Automatic Time-Series Analysis (ATSA), Iterative Haze Optimized Transformation (IHOT) and the default PlanetScope quality control layer. Our results show that, across all sites, STI-ACSS 1) has the highest average overall accuracy (98.03%), 2) generates an average producer accuracy of 95.53% for clouds and 89.48% for cloud shadows, and 3) is robust across sites and seasons. These results suggest the effectiveness of using STI-ACSS for cloud/shadow detection for PlanetScope satellites in the tropics, with potential to be extended to other satellite sensors with limited spectral bands.

AB In the recent decades, satellite monitoring techniques have enhanced the discovery of non-catastrophic slope movements triggered by earthquake shaking involving old paleo-landslides with deep-seated sliding surfaces. Understanding the triggering and attenuation mechanisms of such mass movements is crucial to assessing their hazard. In December 2018, Etna volcano (southern Italy) began a very intense eruption, which was accompanied by a seismic swarm with magnitudes reaching 4.9. Synthetic aperture radar data identified local displacements over a hilly area to the west of Patern`o village. We evaluated the contribution of seismically induced surface instability to the observed ground displacement by employing a multidisciplinary analysis comprising geological, geotechnical and geomorphological data, together with analytical and dynamic modelling. The results allowed us to identify the geometry and kinematics of a previously unknown paleo-landslide, which was stable before the volcanic eruption. The landslide was triggered by the light-to-moderate seismic shaking produced by the strongest event of the seismic sequence, namely, the December 26, Mw 4.9 earthquake. This observation confirms that seismic shaking has a cumulative effect on landslides that does not necessarily manifest as a failure but could evolve into a catastrophic collapse after several earthquakes.

AB Surface soil moisture (SM) retrieval over agricultural areas from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has long been restricted by vegetation attenuation, simplified polarimetric scattering modelling, and limited SAR measurements. This study proposes a modified polarimetric decomposition framework to retrieve SM from multiincidence and multitemporal PolSAR observations. The framework is constructed by combining the X-Bragg model, the extended double Fresnel scattering model and the generalised volume scattering model (GVSM). Compared with traditional decomposition models, the proposed framework considers the depolarisation of dihedral scattering and the diverse vegetation contribution. Under the assumption that SM is invariant for the PolSAR observations at two different incidence angles and that vegetation scattering does not change between two consecutive measurements, analytical parameter solutions, including the dielectric constant of soil and crop stem, can be obtained by solving multivariable nonlinear equations. The proposed framework is applied to the time series of L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar data acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment in 2012. In this study, we assess retrieval performance by comparing the inversion results with in-situ measurements over bean, canola, corn, soybean, wheat and winter wheat areas and comparing the different performance of SM retrieval between the GVSM and Yamaguchi volume scattering models. Given that SM estimation is inherently influenced by crop phenology and empirical parameters which are introduced in the scattering models, we also investigate the influence of surface depolarisation angle and copol phase difference on SM estimation. Results show that the proposed retrieval framework provides an inversion accuracy of RMSE<6.0% and a correlation of R >= 0.6 with an inversion rate larger than 90%. Over wheat and winter wheat fields, a correlation of 0.8 between SM estimates and measurements is observed when the surface scattering is dominant. Specifically, stem permittivity, which is retrieved synchronously with SM also shows a linear relationship with crop biomass and plant water content over bean, corn, soybean and wheat fields. We also find that a priori knowledge of surface depolarisation angle, co-pol phase difference and adaptive volume scattering could help to improve the performance of the proposed SM retrieval framework. However, the GVSM model is still not fully adaptive because the co-pol power ratio of volume scattering is potentially influenced by ground scattering.

AB As the world's leading corn producer, the United States supplies more than 30% of the global corn production. Accurate and timely estimation of corn yield is therefore essential for commodity trading and global food security. Recently, several deep learning models have been explored for corn yield forecasting. Despite success, most existing models only provide yield estimations without quantifying the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Also, the traditional deep learning approaches typically require a large training set and are easily prone to overfitting when the number of samples in the training set is relatively small. To address these limitations, in this study, we developed a county-level corn yield prediction model based on Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using multiple data sources that are publicly available, including time-series satellite products, sequential climate observations, soil property maps, and historical corn yield records. Using preceding years since 2001 for model training, the developed BNN model achieved an average coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.77 for late-season prediction across the U.S. Corn Belt in testing years 2010-2019, and outperformed five other state-of-the-art machine learning models. Detailed evaluation in three representative testing years demonstrated that the proposed BNN model could accurately estimate corn yield not only in normal years but also in abnormal years when extreme weather events happened. Moreover, the timeliness of the prediction was evaluated within the growing season with an R-2 similar to 0.75 achieved by middle August, which is about 2 months before the harvest. We also assessed the predictive uncertainty, and more than 84% of the observed yield records were successfully enveloped in the 95% confidence interval of the predictive yield distribution. Our results also showed that the uncertainty level decreased steadily as time proceeded and stabilized around early August. Uncertainties in yield prediction were mainly induced by the observation noise and also related to the inter-annual and seasonal variabilities of environmental stress such as heat and water stress. This paper provides a robust framework for the within-season prediction of crop yield and highlights the need to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of environmental stress on agricultural productivity and crop yield estimation.

AB Understanding species distribution and canopy structure of mangrove forests is imperative for flora and fauna conservation in mangrove habitats. However, most mangrove studies focused on the top canopy layer without exploring the vertical structure of mangroves. This paper presents multi-layered mangrove mapping which considered both overstory and understory detection and species classification using multispectral WorldView-3 (WV-3) data, airborne hyperspectral images (HSI), and LiDAR point cloud. First, LiDAR returns were stratified into the overstory and understory by analyzing the profile of return height, which helped understand the vertical structure of the mangrove stands. Second, three classification algorithms Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were compared by applying WV-3, HSI, LiDAR data, and their combinations to map seven vegetative species. Feature selection was conducted to identify important features and the optimal feature size prior to classification tasks. The measured and estimated understory canopy heights reached a high correlation coefficient of 0.71, which demonstrated the effectiveness of using LiDAR data and the proposed procedure to stratify multi-layered canopies. The combined HSI and LiDAR data produced satisfactory results by the three classifiers with overall accuracy (OA) varying from 0.86 to 0.88. And the species was also accurately mapped by integrating WV-3 and LiDAR data using both RF and SVM algorithms with OA attaining between 0.84 and 0.86. The results of this study highlight that (1) LiDAR data provided superior information to map the vertical structure of multi-layered mangroves, which provided valuable information to classify single-layered and dual-layered Kandelia obovata with understory beneath; (2) the combination of spectral and LiDAR features improved mangrove species classification; (3) and species mapping results derived from combined datasets appeared to be more influential by LiDAR features when using RF and SVM, but spectral features played a more important role in CNN.

AB An ensemble-based empirical regression algorithm is for the first time developed to retrieve total column water vapor from the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) near-infrared (NIR) channels onboard the Fengyun3B (FY-3B) satellite. This retrieval method uses precipitable water vapor (PWV) data estimated from groundbased Global Positioning System (GPS) data to build a regression model in which the reflectance ratio observed from MERSI NIR absorption channels and the corresponding GPS PWV data are the parameters. The MERSI Level 1b data, specifically the three water vapor absorption channels centered at 905 nm, 940 nm, and 980 nm are used to retrieve water vapor. PWV data observed from 256 ground-based GPS stations located in the western North America in 2016 are used as reference data for model development. Then, validation is performed with data obtained during 2017-2019 from both the western North America and Australia to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results indicate that the new PWV results agree very well with groundbased PWV reference data. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for ensemble median PWV is 16.72% similar to 36.74% in western North America and is 15.47% similar to 32.31% in Australia. The RMSE is 4.635 mm similar to 8.156 mm in western North America and is 5.383 mm similar to 8.900 mm in Australia. The weighted mean value using three-channel ratio transmittance has the best retrieval accuracy, with RMSE of 4.635 mm in western North America and 5.383 mm in Australia. This new PWV algorithm can retrieve PWV from FY-3B data with a higher accuracy for different regions. Different from conventional algorithms, no pre-observed information of atmospheric parameters is required in this model.

AB Large-scale glacier area expansion or shrinkage is among the most conspicuous indicators of regional and global climate change. Glacier extraction from satellite images is an essential step in large-scale area change monitoring. However, glacier extraction is usually influenced by cloud cover and seasonal snow, and thus far, there is no effective and automatic method to monitor glacier area change in large regions. In this study, a new method `multi-temporal minimum NDSI composite' is proposed for clean glacier and nonseasonal snow extraction, and the results agree well with the glacier inventory (excluding the debris part), except in Himalayan regions where non-seasonal snow exists widely out of glaciers. This method is also used to estimate the glacier and nonseasonal snow area changes in High Mountain Asia (HMA) over the past 29 years. With this method, we can use abundant Landsat images of summer seasons from continuous years to composite a cloud-free and seasonal snow-free glacial image pixel by pixel. Glacial maps for the whole HMA are produced every 10 years beginning in 1990, so glacier changes are presented in different subregions and periods. The number of images which is used to composite a glacial map in each pixel is also given for uncertainty analysis. According to the results, the clean glacier and nonseasonal snow area in HMA decreased by -0.43 +/- 0.19%/a during 1990-2018 but had high temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Clean glacier and nonseasonal snow area decreased rapidly during 1990-2000, slowed down during 2000-2010, and then sped up during 2010-2018. The fastest reductions were in Hengduan Shan at rates of approximately -1.05 +/- 0.09%/a, and the only area with growth (at a rate of 0.50 +/- 0.11%/a) was in West Kun Lun during 1990-2018.

AB Accurate estimation of gross primary production (GPP), the amount of carbon absorbed by plants via photosynthesis, is of great importance for understanding ecosystem functions, carbon cycling, and climate-carbon feedbacks. Remote sensing has been widely used to quantify GPP at regional to global scales. However, polarorbiting satellites (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel, Terra, Aqua, Suomi NPP, JPSS, OCO-2) lack the capability to examine the diurnal cycles of GPP because they observe the Earth?s surface at the same time of day. The Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS), launched in June 2018, observes the land surface temperature (LST) at different times of day with high spatial resolution (70 m ? 70 m) from the International Space Station (ISS). Here, we made use of ECOSTRESS data to predict instantaneous GPP with high spatial resolution for different times of day using a data-driven approach based on machine learning. The predictive GPP model used instantaneous ECOSTRESS LST observations along with the daily enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), land cover type from the National Land Cover Database (NCLD), and instantaneous meteorological data from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. Our model estimated instantaneous GPP across 56 flux tower sites fairly well (R2 = 0.88, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 2.42 ?mol CO2 m- 2 s- 1). The instantaneous GPP estimates driven by ECOSTRESS LST captured the diurnal variations of tower GPP for different biomes. We then produced multiple high resolution ECOSTRESS GPP maps for the central and northern California. We found distinct changes in GPP at different times of day (e.g., higher in late morning, peak around noon, approaching zero at dusk), and clear differences in productivity across landscapes (e.g., savannas, croplands, grasslands, and forests) for different times of day. ECOSTRESS GPP also captured the seasonal variations in the diurnal cycling of photosynthesis. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using ECOSTRESS data for producing instantaneous GPP (i.e., GPP for the acquisition time of the ECOSTRESS data) for different times of day. The ECOSTRESS GPP can shed light on how plant photosynthesis and water use vary over the course of the diurnal cycle and inform agricultural management and future improvement of terrestrial biosphere/land surface models.

AB Cloud shadows present in high spatial resolution remote sensing datasets can affect the quality of the data if they are not properly detected and removed. When working with ocean data, cloud shadows are often difficult to differentiate from non-shadow values, since they show similar spectral characteristics than water pixels. A methodology to detect cloud shadows over the ocean is proposed. The present approach combines a series of tests applied directly to the physical variables derived from the satellite measured radiances, and it therefore does not depend on the wavebands measured by a specific satellite sensor. The tests include a departure from an EOF basis calculated using DINEOF, a threshold test, a proximity to cloud test and a ray tracing test. The weighing of the different tests can be adapted to each case or domain of study. The results are compared to manually detected shadows and to another shadow detection method. The approach works with cloud shadows of all sizes, and also with very small objects shadows, like the shadows projected by offshore windmills.

AB In conventional microclimate environment modelling, and the development of tree planning strategies for urban heat mitigation, tree crown surface albedo for any given species is assumed to be a constant. However, our recent research into urban tree radiative performance at the crown level implied that tree crown surface albedo changes over time. Based on the in-situ spectroscopy protocols established previously to measure tree crown transflectance, variation in the characteristics of tree crown surface albedo was explored combining spectroscopy and solar shortwave radiometry. Three commonly planted native UK tree species, Carpinus betulus, Acer campestre, and Taxus baccata, were sampled. Spatial distribution profiles of tree crown transflectance measured at fixed solar altitudes were normalised by in-situ spectroradiometry. Tree crown transflectance in the near infrared (NIR) region was found to be proportionally linked to tree crown surface albedo. Within each species, mean tree crown transflectance in the NIR region of 800-900 nm was approximately 2.5 times tree crown surface albedo. It was further found that infrared radiation (700-2500 nm) accounted for more than 90% of the total transflected shortwave radiation from tree crowns. The results demonstrate that tree crown surface albedo linearly increases with momentary solar altitude and the maximum tree crown surface albedo corresponds to maximum solar altitude at solar noon on sunny days in summer. Tree crown surface albedo across species tends to be strongly dependent on leaf size if considering visibly dense crown foliage. Our findings provide important insights into tree radiative shading effects resulting from temporal variation in tree crown surface albedo, with consequences for urban microclimate modelling and the development of urban heat mitigation strategies.

AB Drought stress is a major contributing factor to plant mortality across the globe. Drought effects are often studied at the local scale, but recent advances in remote sensing allow for observations of plant water status across broad geographic scales. The vegetation optical depth (VOD) derived from satellite-based surface microwave emission has been shown to be sensitive to canopy water content, which is increasingly recognized as an important indicator of water relations and incipient mortality in plants. We develop an index which quantifies the normalized difference between night- and daytime diurnal VOD retrievals (nVOD(r)) and apply it across the western U.S. to determine the relative sensitivity of plants to variations in water supply (soil moisture) and atmospheric water demand (vapor pressure deficit -VPD). Canopy water content dynamics were most sensitive to soil moisture variation at intermediate climatic water deficits where tree cover transitions to grass cover. These areas are in transitional climate zones and occur at ecotones between forest and non-forest vegetation where canopy water content dynamics are most sensitive to both soil moisture and VPD variation. Our results suggest that vegetation in semi-arid ecotones is likely to see the most proximal impacts of drought stress as the planet warms.

TI Characterization of ice shelf fracture features using ICESat-2-A case
   study over the Amery Ice Shelf
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE ICESat-2; Antarctica; Ice shelf; Fracture; Vertical structure
AB Fractures are important structural features that affect the stress condition and stability of ice shelves. Previous studies have mainly focused on the measurement of fractures in the horizontal dimension. However, the vertical morphology of fractures could also be potentially important in determining their evolution and role in ice shelf stability. In this regard, the dense and high-resolution surface elevation measurements collected by the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) provide an excellent opportunity for studying fractures in the vertical dimension over a regional scale. Here we developed an object-oriented algorithm to automatically detect and characterize fracture features (including rifts, surface fractures, and the surface expressions of basal fractures) from ICESat-2 data. We successfully applied the algorithm to ICESat-2 L3A Land Ice Height (ATL06) data over the Amery Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, and retrieved the vertical structural information of two major fracture fields. The detected fracture features match well with the visible fracture lines in Landsat-8 satellite imagery, and the edges of fracture features are well-captured from the ATL06 data. We analyzed the fracture patterns in terms of surface depth, width, vertical shape, length, and orientation. We found that the fracture feature depth is a key factor determining the formation of new fractures and the spatial pattern of depth is closely related to rift formation. We anticipate that further application of the object-oriented method over other ice shelves will produce important insights regarding fracture formation and ice shelf vulnerability by combining ICESat-2-derived vertical information with the horizontal structure retrieved from satellite imagery.

AB Over the last decade, an increase of gastrointestinal illness due to Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the consumption of raw shellfish has been reported in multiple regions around the United States. Studies mainly attribute this increase to rising sea surface temperatures and prolonged warm seasons in the mid-latitudes. Historically, temperature has been the main environmental determinant used to predict V. parahaemolyticus concentrations in shellfish and surface water. However, studies using in situ sampling campaigns have shown that additional water quality parameters can be useful in predicting the bacterium. While the time and cost of obtaining in situ samples throughout the Chesapeake Bay at regular time intervals can exceed available resources, satellite remote sensing has the potential to provide predictions at higher temporal and spatial resolutions. This study uses satellite ocean color remote sensing and sea surface temperature (SST) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to investigate the utility of remotely sensed information for Vibrio parahaemolyticus predictions in the Chesapeake Bay and whether additional remotely sensed information can improve predictions over conventional SST-based models. We find that the addition of remotely sensed salinity, total suspended solids, and chlorophyll-a generally improves presence and abundance predictions compared to SST-only models. Models using remote sensing reflectances and SST also show potential for V. parahaemolyticus predictions, which could bypass the intermediary step of deriving water quality products from reflectances. Remotely sensed ocean color products and SST from one week prior to in situ V. parahaemolyticus measurements are evaluated and shown to be useful in bacterium predictions, which could provide lead-time for management decisions. The forecast models using ocean color products in addition to SST showed improvement over SST-only forecast models. The results of this study suggest that remote sensing can be a valuable tool to aid in higher resolution V. parahaemolyticus predictions and forecasts in the Chesapeake Bay, particularly when multiple environmental predictors are employed. However, the complexities of using remotely sensed data for ecological modeling applications and evaluating model performance also highlight the need for more research in this area.

AB The interest in tree phenology monitoring is increasing because this trait is a robust indicator of the impacts of climate change on natural and managed ecosystems. Different approaches to monitor phenology at different spatial scales, from in situ monitoring to remote sensing, are used to investigate spring and/or autumn phenological changes. In Mediterranean area, most of phenological changes occur during cloudy periods (spring and autumn), leading to a loss of information also for very high temporal resolution satellites. Instead, cloud-uninfluenced sensors, such as radar sensors, can allow to bypass this problem and produce a temporally continuous coverage.
   In this paper, we analyzed the spring phenology of two European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) populations, located at different latitudes in Mediterranean area. Weekly in situ monitoring of leaf-out has been correlated with data collected by Synthetic Aperture Radar. Spring phenological phases were monitored in situ following a modified BBCH-code with a 5-scores scale (from 1 buds closed and covered by scales, to 5 leaf completely unfolded). The score 3 (young leaves starting to emerge from the bud) was considered the bud break. Different site conditions based on aspect (northern and southern) and altitudinal gradient (high and low altitude) have been considered. The aim was to test and implement a new methodology able to decrease the frequency of the field sampling, using remote data, to extend more detailed information on geographical scale, and to reconstruct past phenology.
   Results showed a statistically significant different length of the vegetative spring period, spanning from dormant buds, up to leaves completely unfolded, between sites. Through Synthetic Aperture Radar estimation, this study demonstrates that leaf-out can be monitored with an extreme accuracy. The phenophase score 4 and 5 estimation showed the best performance (RMSE < of 4 days), phenophases score 2 and 3 showed promising performances (4 days < RMSE < 5 days), while phenophases score 1 seems to be not easily detectable, although it can be extrapolated with an RMSE < 6 days.
   This radar approach fixes the cloud problem typical of multispectral approach and very frequent in phenophase change periods in Mediterranean climate. This study promotes the proposed remote sensing approach as a very useful tool to monitor growing season starting in remote areas, helping to reduce in situ observations and allowing past phenology reconstruction.

AB We retrieve sea levels in polar regions via GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R), using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations from eight POLENET GNSS stations. Although geodetic-quality antennas are designed to boost the direct reception from GNSS satellites and to suppress indirect reflections from natural surfaces, the latter can still be used to estimate the sea level in a stable terrestrial reference frame. Here, typical GNSS-R retrieval methodology is improved in two ways, 1) constraining phase-shifts to yield more precise reflector heights and 2) employing an extended dynamic filter to account for the second-order height rate of change (vertical acceleration). We validate retrievals over a 4-year period at Palmer Station (Antarctica), where there is a co-located tide gauge (TG). Because ice contaminates the long-period tidal constituents, we focus on the main tidal species (daily and subdaily), by employing a deseasonalization filter. The difference between sub-hourly GNSS-R retrievals of the ocean surface and TG records has a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 15.4 cm and a correlation of 0.903, while the tidal prediction has a RMSE of 1.9 cm and a correlation of 0.998. There is excellent millimetric agreement between the two sensors for most eight major tidal constituents, with the exception of luni-solar diurnal (K-1), principal solar (S-2), and luni-solar semidiurnal (K-2) components, which are biased in GNSS-R due to the leakage of the GPS orbital period. We also compare the GNSS-R tidal constituents from seven additional POLENET sites, without co-located TG, to global and local ocean tide models. We find that the root-sum-square error (RSSE) of eight major constituents varies between 26.0 cm and 56.9 cm for different models. Given that the agreement in tidal constituents between the TG and GNSS-R was better at Palmer Station, we conclude that assimilating the GNSS-R retrievals into tidal models would improve their accuracy in Antarctica and Greenland, provided that care is exercised to avoid the orbital period overtones and also sea ice.

We present a HIghly Scalable Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (HIST-ARFM) algorithm to combine multispectral images of different sensors to reduce noise and produce monthly gap free high resolution (30 m) observations over land. Our approach uses images from the Landsat (30m spatial resolution and 16 day revisit cycle) and the MODIS missions, both from Terra and Aqua platforms (500m spatial resolution and daily revisit cycle). We implement a bias-aware Kalman filter method in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to obtain fused images at the Landsat spatial-resolution. The added bias correction in the Kalman filter estimates accounts for the fact that both model and observation errors are temporally auto-correlated and may have a non-zero mean. This approach also enables reliable estimation of the uncertainty associated with the final reflectance estimates, allowing for error propagation analyses in higher level remote sensing products. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated products through comparison with other state-of-the-art methods confirm the validity of the approach, and open the door to operational applications at enhanced spatio-temporal resolutions at broad continental scales.

AB With the promise of transformative changes for the management of rural and urban forests, the discrimination of tree species from satellite imagery has been a long-standing goal of remote sensing. For the species-rich urban setting of Washington, D.C. USA, we evaluate current prospects toward this goal by combining a Random Forest (RF) object-based tree species classification method with two large datasets 1) A suite of 12 very high resolution (VHR) WorldView-3 images (WV-3), whose image acquisition date cover each pheno-phase of the growing season from April to November; and 2) the 16,496 street trees from Washington D.C. Department of Transportation's (DDOT) field inventory. We classify the 19 most abundant tree species with an overall accuracy of 61.3% and classify the ten most abundant genera with an overall accuracy of 73.7%. We observe that (1) there are larger declines in accuracy when attempting to classify species in the same genus, and (2) the most valuable phenological period is fall senescence for classification at different taxonomic levels. Especially if satellite data can be matched to the key pheno-phases, our study highlights that current VHR satellite sensors now have the radiometric, spectral, and spatial resolution to potentially help manage species-rich urban forests.

AB Soil Moisture (SM) is a direct measure of agricultural drought. While there are several global SM indices, none of them directly use SM observations in a near-real-time capacity and as an operational tool. This paper presents a near-real-time global SM index monitor based on integrated SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) remote sensing data. We make use of the short period (2015-2018) of SMAP datasets in combination with two approaches-Cumulative Distribution Function Mapping (CDFM) and Bayesian conditional process-and integrate them with SMOS data in a way that SMOS data is consistent with SMAP. The integrated SMOS and SMAP (SMOS/SMAP) has an increased global revisit frequency and a period of record from 2010 to the present. A four-parameter Beta distribution was fitted to the SMOS/SMAP dataset for each calendar month of each grid cell at similar to 36 km resolution for the period from 2010 to 2018. We used an asymptotic method that guarantees the values of the bounding parameters of the Beta distribution will envelop both the smallest and largest observed values. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test showed that more grids globally will pass if the integrated dataset is from the Bayesian conditional approach. A daily global SM index map is generated and posted online based on translating each grid's integrated SM value for that day to a corresponding probability percentile relevant to the particular calendar month from 2010 to 2018. For validation, we use the Canadian Prairies Ecozone (CPE). We compare the integrated SM with the SMAP core validation and RISMA sites from ISMN, compare our indices with other models (VIC, ESA's CCI SM v04.4 integrated satellite data, and SPI-1), and make a two-by-two comparison of candidate indices using heat maps and summary CDF statistics. Furthermore, we visually compare our global SM-based index maps with those produced by other organizations. Our Global SM Index Monitor (GSMIM) performed, in many tests, similarly to the CCI's product SM index but with the advantage of being a near-real-time tool, which has applications for identifying evolving drought for food security conditions, insurance, policymaking, and crop planning especially for the remote parts of the globe.

AB We studied the influence of changing carotenoid pigments on the sensitivity of the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) to photosynthesis dynamics. The goal of the measurements was to examine how the introduction of Delta PRI into the working dataset can improve the estimation of photosynthesis. Spectral and photosynthetic characteristics of European beech and Norway spruce saplings were periodically measured in growth chambers with an adjustable irradiance and temperature. Patterns of environmental changes inside the growth chambers were created by periodic changes in irradiance and temperature. Four general irradiance periods lasting 10-12 days each were established. Introduced irradiance regimes varied in the sum of daily irradiance and amplitude of irradiance changes. Temperature was changed with more complex patterns to induce changes in xanthophyll cycle pigments at various time scales within these regimes. Our measurements confirmed the PRI linkage to photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE). However, the strength of this connection was found to be dependent on changing pigment concentrations, specifically on the change in the ratio of chlorophylls to carotenoids. Furthermore, a negative interference in photosynthesis estimation from PRI was recorded if the temperature was lowered overnight to 12 degrees C. The differential PRI (Delta PRI), calculated as the simple difference between the PRI value measured during the daytime period and in early morning (PRI0), revealed a decreased effect from pigments and cold temperature on LUE estimation. The regression analysis among all measured data identified an increased association between PRI and LUE following the introduction of Delta PRI from R-2 = 0.26 to 0.69 in beech and from R-2 = 0.61 to 0.77 in spruce data. The analyses showed that both leaf carotenoid concentrations and the conversion state of xanthophyll cycle pigments played a significant role in determining PRI and PRI0 values and that the accurate assessment of these pigments in PRI across multiple levels of stress from irradiance and temperature might improve estimations of LUE through Delta PRI. In our data, Delta PRI appeared to be a good measure of photosynthesis, the dynamics of which differed between beech and spruce saplings upon switching temperatures.

AB Environmental conditions are important drivers in regulating the distribution pattern of phytoplankton composition in the world's oceans. We constructed models that predict pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton size classes and assessed the impact of separately including sea surface temperature (SST) and estimates of light level in the surface mixed-layer on model skill. The empirical models were trained using size classes estimated by chemotaxonomic analysis of in situ high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigments and environmental data originating from the Atlantic Ocean. As the accuracy of transforming pigment data into quantitative size classes is crucial when constructing phytoplankton size composition (PSC) models, we also quantified the resulting differences of our and several existing PSC models when using class sizes derived from HPLC pigments by two common chemotaxonomic methods, CHEMTAX and Diagnostic Pigments (DP). Addition of the environmental variables to abundance-based models using our approach improved the skill of correctly predicting PSC, reducing the root mean square difference (RMSD) by 10 to 20% in the best cases. Addition of SST yielded the highest percentage decreases, on average, for all three size classes, with greatest improvement in microplankton and nanoplankton fractions. These models performed equal to or better than several existing abundance-based models. The improvements in model predictions, however, could be obscured by the choice of pigment method used to generate the initial PSC data set. Insufficient data is available to assess whether CHEMTAX or DP is the more appropriate chemotaxonomic method to employ when estimating PSC. Further collection and analysis of additional water samples for phytoplankton taxa and size by microscopic methods including traditional microscopic cell counts and automated methods - and HPLC pigment data are required to answer this question.

AB In the face of a sparse global river gauging station network in decline, new approaches are needed to reconstruct and monitor river discharge from satellite observations. Where in-situ river discharge measurements are not available, it may be possible to use discharge estimates from a hydrological model, provided the model simulations are of sufficient quality, to construct satellite-based discharge gauging. We tested this approach by developing model- and gauge-based satellite gauging reaches (SGRs) using 0.05 degrees MODIS optical remote sensing at similar to 10,000 gauged and similar to 370,000 ungauged river reaches globally. Model-based SGRs are aimed to infer temporal flow patterns and reflect unusually high or low river discharge behavior (i.e, flood or drought conditions), if not necessarily absolute discharge volumes. The model-based SGRs achieved a discharge prediction skill that was often similar to gauge-based SGRs, and sometimes better than the model itself. Our results showed promising opportunities to develop model-based SGRs in sparsely gauged basins in South America, Africa, and Asia. We selected river reaches, with mean widths ranging from 67 to 3105 m, representing both poor and successful SGRs in different environments for case studies to analyze conditions for successful SGR development. River size and morphology were the main factors determining the performance of SGRs. Wide channels with strong temporal variations, broad floodplains and multiple braided or anastomosing channels provided the best conditions for SGRs. The probability of constructing a successful SGR could be predicted from high-resolution inundation summary data available globally, and can thus be predicted anywhere. Ongoing increases in the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing will further increase the number of river reaches for which satellite-based discharge gauging will become possible.

AB Volcanoes are complex environmental systems that pose challenges to scientific study, due to their inherently hazardous nature and in many cases, remote locations. Satellite-based remote sensing provides a useful tool for assessing both ongoing activity and retrospective eruptions. This paper represents an initial application of a multi-sensor approach, in part to demonstrate its strengths and limitations in a single volcanic region that is fairly well monitored in situ. We utilize data from five NASA satellite-based instruments, having up to 18 years of global observations, to conduct in-depth investigations of eight volcanoes on the Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia) that were active between 2000 and 2018. From 169 eruptive plumes observed, we performed detailed plume-dynamics analysis in eighty-two cases for which sufficiently favorable observations were obtained. Plume heights from MISR and CALIOP, microphysical particle properties (e.g. fine ash, sulfates) from MISR, thermal anomalies generated by lava features from MODIS, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations from OMI and OMPS are all considered. Evidence of eruption evolution over months-to-years was identified at Shiveluch, Kliuchevskoi, Kizimen, Karymsky, Zhupanovsky, Koryaksky and Kambalny. In cases with extensive data coverage (Kliuchevskoi, Kizimen, Karymsky and Zhupanovsky), underlying subsurface dynamics is inferred, corroborated where possible with detailed ground-based data records. The 1.1 km resolution of the particle property retrievals from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument capture downwind plume-particle evolution in many cases. Comparison of changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD), retrieved effective particle size (REPS) and retrieved effective particle absorption (REPA) map to six plume transport regimes, indicating varying degrees of downwind particle aggregation, deposition, and/or new particle formation. Distinct meteorological conditions are identified as likely driving these evolutionary processes, most notably the atmospheric static stability and wind shear at plume altitude. This approach can be applied to volcanic plumes globally, including those for which surface monitoring is limited or entirely absent.

AB Temporal information on mangrove extent, age, structure and biomass provides an important contribution towards understanding the role of these ecosystems in terms of the services they provide (e.g., in relation to storage of carbon, conservation biodiversity), particularly given the diversity of influences of human activity and natural events and processes. Focusing on the Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Perak Province, Peninsular Malaysia, this study aimed to retrieve comprehensive information on the biophysical properties of mangroves from spaceborne optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) to support better understanding of their dynamics in a managed setting. For the period 1988 to 2016 (29 years), forest age was estimated on at least an annual basis by combining time-series of Landsat-derived Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Japanese L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The NDMI was further used to retrieve canopy cover (%). Interferometric Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) X/C-band (2000), TanDEM-X-band (2010-2016) and stereo WorldView-2 stereo (2016) data were evaluated for their role in estimating canopy height (CH), from which above ground biomass (AGB, Mg ha(-1)) was derived using pre-established allometry. Whilst both L-band HH and HV data increased with AGB after about 8-10 years of growth, retrieval was compromised by mixed scattering from varying amounts of dead woody debris following clearing and wood material within regenerating forests, thinning of trees at similar to 15 and 20 years, and saturation of L-band SAR data after approximately 20 years of growth. Reference was made to stereo Phantom-3 DJI stereo imagery to support estimation of canopy cover (CC) and validation of satellite-derived CH. AGB estimates were compared with ground-based measurements. Using relationships with forest age, both CH and AGB were estimated for each date of Landsat or L-band SAR observation and the temporal trends in L-band SAR were shown to effectively track the sequences of clearing and regeneration. From these, four stages of the harvesting cycle were defined. The study provided new information on the biophysical properties and growth dynamics of mangrove forests in the MMFR, inputs for future monitoring activities, and methods for facilitating better characterisation and mapping of mangrove areas worldwide.

AB Cloud detection algorithms are crucial in many remote-sensing applications to allow an optimized processing of the acquired data, without the interference of the cloud fields above the surfaces of interest (e.g., land, coral reefs, etc.). While this is a well-established area of research, replete with a number of cloud detection methodologies, many issues persist for detecting clouds over areas of high albedo surfaces (snow and sand), detecting cloud shadows, and transferring a given algorithm between observational platforms. Particularly for the latter, algorithms are often platform-specific with corresponding rule-based tests and thresholds inherent to instruments and applied corrections. Here, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm for the detection of cloud and cloud shadow fields in multi-channel satellite imagery from World-View-2 (WV-2) and Sentinel-2 (S-2), using their Red, Green, Blue, and Near-Infrared (RGB, NIR) channels. This algorithm is developed within the NASA NeMO-Net project, a multi-modal CNN for global coral reef classification which utilizes imagery from multiple remote sensing aircraft and satellites with heterogeneous spatial resolution and spectral coverage. Our cloud detection algorithm is novel in that it attempts to learn deep invariant features for cloud detection utilizing both the spectral and the spatial information inherent in satellite imagery. The first part of our work presents the CNN cloud and cloud shadow algorithm development (trained using WV-2 data) and its application to WV-2 (with a cloud detection accuracy of 89%) and to S-2 imagery (referred to as augmented CNN). The second part presents a new domain adaptation CNN-based approach (domain adversarial NN) that allows for better adaptation between the two satellite platforms during the prediction step, without the need to train for each platform separately. Our augmented CNN algorithm results in better cloud prediction rates as compared to the original S-2 cloud mask (81% versus 48%), but still, clear pixels prediction rate is lower than S-2 (81% versus 91%). Nevertheless, the application of the domain adaptation approach shows promise in better transferring the knowledge gained from one trained domain (WV-2) to another (S-2), increasing the prediction accuracy of both clear and cloudy pixels when compared to a network trained only by WV-2. As such, domain adaptation may offer a novel means of additional augmentation for our CNN-based cloud detection algorithm, increasing robustness towards predictions from multiple remote sensing platforms. The approach presented here may be further developed and optimized for global and multi-modal (multi-channel and multi-platform) satellite cloud detection capability by utilizing a more global dataset.

AB Land surface phenology (LSP) has been widely used as the "footprint" of urbanization and global climate change. Shifts of ISP have cascading effects on food production, carbon sequestration, water consumption, biodiversity, and public health. Previous studies mainly focused on investigating the effects of urbanization on the spatial patterns of ISP by comparing phenological metrics, e.g. start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS), between urban center and the surrounding rural regions. However, it remains unclear how urbanization-induced land cover conversions and climate change jointly influence the temporal variations of SOS and EOS within the urban ecosystem. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized daily two-band enhanced vegetation index, daily meteorological record, and annual land cover dataset to investigate the respective impacts of urbanization and climate change on temporal shifts of ISP between the post- and the pre-urbanization periods over 196 large cities in the northern mid-latitudes. We found 51% of the cities experienced an advanced SOS with an average of -6.39 +/- 5.82 days after urbanization has occurred, while the remaining 49% of the cities had a delayed SOS with an average of 7.56 +/- 5.63 days. We also found a later EOS at 53% of the cities and an earlier EOS at 47% of the cities with an average of 8.43 +/- 7.59 and - 5.57 +/- 4.99 days between the post- and pre-urbanization periods, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis indicates that climate variables (i.e. temperature, precipitation, and insolation) play dominant roles in regulating the temporal shifts of ISP. Furthermore, the earlier SOS and later EOS were significantly correlated with the amplitude of urbanization (i.e. increase of impervious surface area) in cities after controlling for effects of climate factors. These patterns were generally consistent across eight climate zones. Our findings provide critical information in modeling natural and anthropogenic effects on urban ecosystem, with important benefits for urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation.

AB Agriculture provides humanity with food, fibers, fuel, and raw materials that are paramount for human livelihood. Today, this role must be satisfied within a context of environmental sustainability and climate change, combined with an unprecedented and still-expanding human population size, while maintaining the viability of agricultural activities to ensure both subsistence and livelihoods. Remote sensing has the capacity to assist the adaptive evolution of agricultural practices in order to face this major challenge, by providing repetitive information on crop status throughout the season at different scales and for different actors. We start this review by making an overview of the current remote sensing techniques relevant for the agricultural context. We present the agronomical variables and plant traits that can be estimated by remote sensing, and we describe the empirical and deterministic approaches to retrieve them. A second part of this review illustrates recent research developments that permit to strengthen applicative capabilities in remote sensing according to specific requirements for different types of stakeholders. Such agricultural applications include crop breeding, agricultural land use monitoring, crop yield forecasting, as well as ecosystem services in relation to soil and water resources or biodiversity loss. Finally, we provide a synthesis of the emerging opportunities that should strengthen the role of remote sensing in providing operational, efficient and long-term services for agricultural applications.

AB We demonstrate a novel method to retrieve snow liquid water content and density over a site in the ablation zone of the Western Greenland Ice Sheet from L-band radiometer data measured by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. Previous demonstrations using ground-based close-range radiometry separately retrieved snow density and snow wetness over frozen and thawed ground. We apply similar techniques over the ice sheet to simultaneously retrieve snow density and wetness at the location of "Swiss Camp" from June 2010 through August 2018 at nearly daily temporal resolution. Achieved results are compared to in-situ air temperature data and to a well-known 19 GHz and 37 GHz passive-microwave melt characterization technique known as the cross-polarized gradient ratio (XPGR). The L-band based snow wetness retrievals often detect the onset of seasonal melt earlier than the XPGR algorithm without the need for empirically tuned thresholds. We also demonstrate the performance of the SMOS based snow wetness retrievals based on error statistics compared with an air temperature melt proxy. By applying temporal averaging to the SMOS based snow density retrievals, we achieve reasonable agreement with in-situ observations from May 2014 and May 2018. The demonstrated retrieval algorithm shows potential as a future SMOS data product for ice-covered regions of the cryosphere.

AB Insufficient knowledge about spatial-temporal forest heterogeneities in the tropics is a major impediment to better estimation of carbon storage and prevention of forest loss by remote sensing. Seasonality induced fluctuations can severely impede the reliability of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) applications like forest classification, deforestation detection and biomass estimation. In the past, the seasonality effects on SAR data acquired over tropical forests have been largely ignored due to the lack of consistent time-series data for the entire region. To overcome this knowledge gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive statistical assessment of L-band SAR backscatter variability in tropical forests by means of a homogeneous big data analysis on multitemporal ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 dual-polarization ScanSAR data. Virtually the entire tropical forest region was monitored from 2016 to 2018 with 42 days intervals. Approximately 250 TB of ScanSAR data were computed on a 0.05 decimal degrees grid to produce forest maps which provide more detailed and reliable information about the spatial and temporal behavior of tropical forests. The first, easy to understand global forest variability maps provide unseen insights into forest structures for the entire tropical belt from local to continental scale. While the differences between the evergreen rainforest and the (semi-) deciduous dry forest is obviously large in the spatial domain, in the temporal domain seasonal changes can easily cause variations in the same order of magnitude within the same forest class. Depending on the area, natural environmental factors like flooding or leaf shedding can result in seasonal gamma naught ranges exceeding 3 dB in both HH and HV polarization. The findings of this study should have important implications for all future remote sensing research efforts on tropical forests. With drastically increasing availability of more frequent high-resolution L-band observations in the coming decade, these characteristic forest variabilities must be considered in the development of active and passive microwave remote sensing algorithms. The better understanding of the underlying dynamics and processes is expected to improve forest remote sensing applications for the upcoming L-band SAR satellite generation including ALOS-4, NISAR, and Tandem-L.

AB Quantitative understanding of vegetation vulnerability under drought stress is essential to initiating drought preparedness and mitigation. In this study, a bivariate probabilistic framework is developed for assessing vegetation vulnerability and mapping drought-prone ecosystems more informatively, which is different from previous studies conducted in a deterministic way. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is initially correlated to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at contrasting timescales to evaluate the degree of vegetation dependence on water availability and screen out the vegetation response time. Afterward, the monthly NDVI series is connected with the most correlated SPI to derive joint distributions using a copula method. On such basis, conditional probabilities of vegetation losses are estimated under multiple drought scenarios and used for revealing tempo-spatial patterns of vegetation vulnerability. Particular focus is directed to the Loess Plateau (LP), China, which is a world-famous environmentally fragile area. Results indicate that the proposed framework is valid for vegetation vulnerability assessment as the pair-wise SPI-NDVI observations fall within high-density areas of the estimated NDVI distributions. From a probabilistic perspective, roughly 95% of the LP exhibits greater probability of vegetation losses when suffering from water deficits rather than water surplus. Vegetation loss probabilities reaching their peak (39.7%) in summer indicate the highest vegetation vulnerability to drought stress in summer months sequentially followed by autumn (32.9%) and spring (31.0%), which is linked to marked variations in water requirement at different stages of vegetation growth. Spatially, drought-vulnerable regions are identified in the western edge with vegetation loss probability 20.6% higher than the LP mean value, suggesting higher vulnerability in more arid areas. Irrigation practices and large-scale vegetation restoration, as two important sources of anthropogenic disturbance in the LP, benefit the decreased vegetation vulnerability over the majority of affected areas. Results may increase our knowledge about climatic controls on vegetation health and support the ecosystem restoration planning in the LP.

AB Prompted by laser scanning (LS), point clouds have been applied in forest biomass estimation for three decades. Previously reported evaluations focused on the accuracy of above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates but did not distinguish between the influences from the data and those from the algorithm of data processing. Therefore, insufficient information has been available for hardware and software developers to prioritize future developments. In the present study, we evaluated the amount of trees digitized in terrestrial and aerial point clouds by means of manual tree detection. On a plot-level (a fixed size of 32 m x 32 m), approximately 97%, 93%, and 75% of individual trees could be recorded in easy (ca. 700 stems/ha), medium (ca. 900 stems/ha), and difficult stands (ca. 2, 200 stems/ha), respectively, using five-scan terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). With aerial point cloud from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne laser scanning (ULS) (ca. 450 points/m(2)), promising digitization can be expected for 87%, 69%, and 55% of individual trees in easy, medium and difficult stands, respectively. Plot level AGB concentrates on big trees. The dominant and codominant trees combined accounted for 90.7%, 86.0%, and 69.7% of the plot-level AGB, and their population combined accounted for 73.2%, 55.3%, and 31.0%, respectively, in easy, medium, and difficult stands. Therefore, missing of dominant and codominant trees in data has a greater influence on plot-level AGB estimates than missing intermediate and suppressed trees. At a tree level, when AGB was predicted from tree height and DBH, the relative root mean square error (RMSE%) of AGB estimates in easy, medium, and difficult plots were 10.1%, 14.6%, and 20.4%, respectively, based on manually measured tree parameters from TLS point clouds. The manual measurements from ULS point clouds provided RMSE%s of 30.4%, 51.1%, and 76.9% in easy, medium, and difficult plots, respectively. These results indicate the magnitude of errors introduced by the data, and for ULS, by the tree height DBH allometry used. When using automated in-house algorithms of the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute (FGI), the RMSE%s of tree-level AGB estimates using TLS were 11.5%, 17.8%, and 43.9% in easy, medium, and difficult plots, respectively. When using ULS, the corresponding errors were 31.7%, 57.7%, and 73.3%, respectively. Such results suggest that the automated algorithms perform similarly to manual processing in the tree-level ABG estimation from terrestrial and aerial point clouds, specifically in easy and medium forest stands. The incomplete tree digitization in the data was the main factor affecting the accuracy of tree-centric AGB estimates. Fusion of the terrestrial and aerial observation perspectives provided promising results. When manual TLS-based DBH and manual ULS-based tree height were used, the RMSE% was reduced to 8.6%-12.7%, compared to 10.1%-20.4% when only TLS-manual tree parameters were used and 30.3%-76.9% when only ULS-manual tree parameters were used.

AB Drought is a common hydrometeorological phenomenon and a pervasive global hazard. As our climate changes, it is likely that drought events will become more intense and frequent. Effective drought monitoring is therefore critical, both to the research community in developing an understanding of drought, and to those responsible for drought management and mitigation. Over the past 50 years remote sensing has shifted the field away from reliance on traditional site-based measurements and enabled observations and estimates of key drought-related variables over larger spatial and temporal scales than was previously possible. This has proven especially important in data poor regions with limited in-situ monitoring stations. Available remotely sensed data products now represent almost all aspects of drought propagation and have contributed to our understanding of the phenomena. In this review we chart the rise of remote sensing for drought monitoring, examining key milestones and technologies for assessing meteorological, agricultural and hydrological drought events. We reflect on challenges the research community has faced to date, such as limitations associated with data record length and spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. This review then looks ahead to the future in terms of new technologies, such as the ESA Sentinel satellites, analytical platforms and approaches, such as Google EarthEngine, and the utility of existing data in new drought monitoring applications. We look forward to the continuation of 50 years of progress to provide effective, innovative and efficient drought monitoring solutions utilising remote sensing technology.

AB The growing availability of global measurements of sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can help in improving crop monitoring, especially the monitoring of photosynthetic activity. However, variations in top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF cannot be directly interpreted as physiological changes because of the confounding effects of vegetation biochemistry (i.e. pigments, dry matter and water) and structure. In this study, we propose an approach of using radiative transfer models (RTMs) and TOC reflectance to estimate the biochemical and structural effects on TOC SIF, as a necessary step in retrieving physiological information from TOC SIF. The approach was assessed by using airborne (HyPlant) reflectance and SIF data acquired over an agricultural experimental farm in Germany on two days, before and during a heat event in summer 2015 with maximum temperatures of 27 degrees C and 34 degrees C, respectively. The results show that over 76% variation among different crops in SIF observations was explained by variation in vegetation biochemistry and structure. In addition, the changes of vegetation biochemistry and structure explained as much as 73% variation between the two days in far-red SIF, and 40% variation in red SIF. The remaining unexplained variation was mostly attributed to the variability in physiological status. We conclude that reflectance provides valuable information to account for biochemical and structural effects on SIF and to advance analysis of SIF observations. The combination of RTMs, reflectance and SIF opens new pathways to detect vegetation biochemical, structural and physiological changes.

AB Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Arrayed L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) HH and HV polarization data were used previously to produce annual, global 25 m forest maps between 2007 and 2010, and the latest global forest maps of 2015 and 2016 were produced by using the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data. However, annual 25 m spatial resolution forest maps during 2011-2014 are missing because of the gap in operation between ALOS and ALOS-2, preventing the construction of a continuous, fine resolution time-series dataset on the world's forests. In contrast, the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI images were available globally since 2000. This research developed a novel method to produce annual 25 m forest maps during 2007-2016 by fusing the fine spatial resolution, but asynchronous PALSAR/PALSAR-2 with coarse spatial resolution, but synchronous MODIS NDVI data, thus, filling the four-year gap in the ALOS and ALOS-2 time-series, as well as enhancing the existing mapping activity. The method was developed concentrating on two key objectives: 1) producing more accurate 25 m forest maps by integrating PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI data during 2007-2010 and 2015-2016; 2) reconstructing annual 25 m forest maps from time-series MODIS NDVI images during 2011-2014. Specifically, a decision tree classification was developed for forest mapping based on both the PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI data, and a new spatial-temporal super resolution mapping was proposed to reconstruct the 25 m forest maps from time-series MODIS NDVI images. Three study sites including Paraguay, the USA and Russia were chosen, as they represent the world's three main forest types: tropical forest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, and boreal conifer forest, respectively. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed approach produced the most accurate continuous time-series of fine spatial resolution forest maps both visually and quantitatively. For the forest maps during 2007-2010 and 2015-2016, the results had greater overall accuracy values (> 98%) than those of the original JAXA forest product. For the reconstructed 25 m forest maps during 2011-2014, the increases in classifications accuracy relative to three benchmark methods were statistically significant, and the overall accuracy values of the three study sites were almost universally > 92%. The proposed approach, therefore, has great potential to support the production of annual 25 m forest maps by fusing PALSAR/PALSAR-2 and MODIS NDVI during 2007-2016.

AB Accurately mapping heterogeneous agricultural landscape is an important prerequisite for agricultural field management (e.g., weed control), plant phenotyping and yield prediction, as well as ecological characterization. Compared to traditional mapping practices that require intensive field surveys, remote sensing technologies offer efficient and cost-effective means for crop type mapping from regional to global scales. However, mapping heterogeneous agricultural landscape is a challenge because of diverse and complex spectral profiles of crops. We propose a novel deep learning method, namely deep progressively expanded network (dPEN), for mapping nineteen different objects including crop types, weeds and crop residues, in a heterogeneous agricultural field using WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery. To assess the mapping accuracy of dPEN, we created a calibrated WV-3 dataset with the corresponding ground truth. In addition, the suitability of visible/near-infrared (VNIR, 400-1040 nm) and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1195 nm-2365 nm) bands of WV-3 to classification accuracy were examined and discussed in detail. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to explore the significance of all SWIR bands in WV-3 for classification accuracy in a heterogeneous agricultural landscape. The results demonstrated that: (1) The proposed dPEN allows for building a deeper neural network from multi spectral data which was the limitation of many convolutional neural networks; (2) dPEN was able to extract more discriminative features from VNIR and SWIR bands by producing the highest overall accuracy (OA: 86.06%) over competing methods such as support vector machine and random forest; (3) The inclusion of WV-3 SWIR bands greatly improved the classification accuracy; (4) SWIR bands were particularly beneficial to improve the classification accuracy of some individual classes such as weeds, crop residues, and corn and soybean during late developmental stages; (5) The red-edge band (705-745 nm) was identified as the most important band affecting the classification accuracy nearly 10%, whereas the coastal band (400-450 nm) provided the lowest contribution; and (6) SWIR-5 band (2145-2185 nm) contributed most to OA by enhancing it approximately 4% when combined with VNIR bands, while SWIR-1 (1195-1225 nm) yielded the lowest improvement (1.55%) for OA. These research outcomes provide useful information for efficiently mapping agricultural landscape, and indicate the potential practices of dPEN and contributions of spectral bands in WV-3 for plant phenotyping, weed control, and crop residue retention.

AB Tropical disturbed forests play an important role in global carbon sequestration due to their rapid post-disturbance biomass accumulation rates. However, the accurate estimation of the carbon sequestration capacity of disturbed forests is still challenging due to large uncertainties in their spatial distribution. Using Google Earth Engine (GEE), we developed a novel approach to map cumulative disturbed forest areas based on the 27-year time-series of Landsat surface reflectance imagery. This approach integrates single date features with temporal characteristics from six time-series trajectories (two Landsat shortwave infrared bands and four vegetation indices) using a random forest machine learning classification algorithm. We demonstrated the feasibility of this method to map disturbed forests in three different forest ecoregions (seasonal, moist and dry forest) in Mato Grosso, Brazil, and found that the overall mapping accuracy was high, ranging from 81.3% for moist forest to 86.1% for seasonal forest. According to our classification, dry forest ecoregion experienced the most severe disturbances with 41% of forests being disturbed by 2010, followed by seasonal forest and moist forest ecoregions. We further separated disturbed forests into degraded old-growth forests and post-deforestation regrowth forests based on an existing post-deforestation land use map (TerraClass) and found that the area of degraded old-growth forests was up to 62% larger than the extent of post-deforestation regrowth forests, with 18% of old-growth forests actually being degraded. Application of this new classification approach to other tropical areas will provide a better constraint on the spatial extent of disturbed forest areas in Tropics and ultimately towards a better understanding of their importance in the global carbon cycle.

   in Australia

AB Australia's marginal seas include a wide range of ocean current regimes ranging from tide-dominated in the North-West where the continental shelf is wide, to boundary current- and eddy-dominated in the South-East, where the shelf is narrow. Here, we take the opportunity to test the GlobCurrent surface ocean current products against in-situ observations in these two contrasting regimes. Observations by Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) instruments of Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and drifting buoys of the Global Drifting Programme (GDP) are used.
   The monthly-timescale variability of the GlobCurrent alongshore current component is in moderately good agreement with the observations on the continental shelf in the South-East but neither the shorter period variability nor the long-term mean are representative of the ADCP observations. While the observed tidal currents are negligibly small, the wind-driven signals are not. But these are evidently too transient to be adequately sampled by altimetry. The inclusion of an Ekman component does not represent these signals because the interaction of the Ekman transport with the coastal boundary condition is not included. Similarly, the error of the time-mean velocity, which is the dominant error, is because that product is not designed to represent the highly anisotropic nature of the sea level gradients over the continental shelf nor the constraints on the flow field that are imposed by the topography. We thus conclude that the GlobCurrent product needs improvements before it can be described as very suitable for applications on this, and probably other, narrow continental shelf. Off the continental shelf, in contrast, the GlobCurrent products compare quite well with the trajectories of drifting buoys, confirming that the products are quite suitable for blue-water applications.
   In contrast to the South-East, the tides are very strong in the North-West region of Australia. The sub-tidal variability is weak, in both relative and absolute senses. Consequently, the removal of the tidal signal from the sea level observations needs to be very complete for the residual error to be smaller than the true sub-tidal signal. Transient wind forced signals are also occasionally large so this step of the de-aliasing also needs to be very accurate. Unfortunately, it appears that more work is required before accurate estimates of sub-tidal variability are available from GlobCurrent: the magnitude of the GlobCurrent estimates of sub-tidal current variability far exceed the magnitude of, and are uncorrelated with, the detided ADCP data.

AB Accurate and up-to-date cropland maps play an important role in the study of food security. Traditional mapping of croplands using medium resolution (10-100m) remote sensing imagery involving a "one-time, one-place" approach requires significant computing and labor resources. Although high mapping accuracies can be achieved using this approach, it is tedious and expensive to collect reference information to train the classifiers at each location and to apply over large areas, such as a continent. Moreover, large area cropland mapping presents additional challenges including a wide range of agricultural management practices, climatic conditions, and crop types. To overcome these challenges, here we report on a generalized image classifier to map cropland extent, which builds a classification model using training data from one location and time period, applied to other times and locations without the need for additional training data. The study was demonstrated across eight agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa using Landsat data acquired between 2009 and 2011. To reduce between-scene variability associated with image availability and cloud cover, input data were reduced to salient temporal statistics derived from enhanced vegetation index (EVI) combined with topographic variables. The generalized classifier was then tested across three levels of generalization: 1. individual - where training data were extracted from and applied to the same Landsat footprint; 2. AEZ where training data were extracted from a set of Landsat footprints within an AEZ and applied to any other Landsat footprint in the same AEZ; and 3. regional where training data were extracted from a set of Landsat footprints in the whole study area and applied to any other Landsat footprint inside the study area. Results showed that the generalized classifier is successful in identifying and mapping croplands with comparable success across all three levels of generalization with minimal cost: average loss in accuracy (as measured by overall accuracy) from the individual level (average overall accuracy of 80 +/- 5%) to regional level (average overall accuracy of 74 +/- 10%) is between 2 and 10% depending on the location. Results also show that generalization is not sensitive to the choice of the classification algorithm the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) model performs equally well compared to many popular machine learning algorithms found in the literature. This work suggests the generalization/signature extension framework has a great potential for rapid identification and mapping of croplands with reasonable accuracies over large areas using only easily computed vegetation indices with very little user input and ground information requirement.

AB The primary objective of the German TanDEM-X mission is the generation of a globally available, highly accurate and detailed digital elevation model (DEM), with the final product having 12 m posting, 2 m relative and 10 m absolute vertical accuracy. The first version of this global DEM has been finalized by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), in September 2016. Our experience with the experimental application of non-local means filters to TanDEM-X data suggests that TanDEM-X has the potential of producing DEMs of even higher resolution and accuracy. The goal of this investigation is to explore the possibility of employing non-local InSAR filters to achieve an effective resolution of 6 m, with an equivalent posting, and a relative height error below 0.8 m, i.e. an increase of quality by a factor of 2 x 2 in resolution and a factor of 2 m/0.8 m = 2.5 in height accuracy - all in all one order of magnitude.

AB In this paper, a new methodology was developed to automatically update Landslide state of Activity Maps by combining multi-temporal A-DInSAR data (LAMBDA). LAMBDA procedure was tested using ERS-1/2 (1992-2000), Radarsat-1/2 (2003-2009) and COSMO-SkyMed data (2011-2014) over an area of 2199 km(2) located in Alps context of Piedmont region (north-western Italy). For the first time, a multidimensional landslide activity matrix was implemented to update the landslide state of activity during the monitored time span. For the definition of the state of activity, the representative velocity of each landslide was divided by the standard deviation of the velocities along the slope of the whole dataset. Thus, a common stability threshold of 1 was introduced for multi-sensors A-DInSAR data, allowing to distinguish a phenomenon with stable targets (PS-DS) or unstable PS-DS. By combining activity classes estimated during different time spans allows to determine if a phenomenon is active, reactivated, or dormant. Furthermore, an innovative confidence degree assessment was carried out to verify the reliability of the procedure, by considering the measuring points distribution and the variability of the movements for each landslide. The results were validated using the landslide inventory of the study area and in-situ monitoring systems for representative case studies. Thanks to this approach an updated state of activity until 2014 was assigned to 507 landslides out the 1657 which were previously mapped in the study area.

   temperature data using a novel High Resolution Multistage Spectral
   Interpolation (HRMSI) technique
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DE SST subpixel variability; Spatial variability; Interpolation techniques
ID VALIDATION
AB A novel interpolation technique is applied to assessment of the quality of sea surface temperature (SST) observations and quantitative analysis of the subpixel variability within satellite footprints of different size. Using retrieved satellite data as input, the new, global, multistage interpolation technique generates a trigonometric polynomial, providing a representation of the underlying physical SST field in functional form. The resulting interpolating function can be efficiently and accurately evaluated anywhere within the domain over which it was derived and its moments calculated to estimate the mean and variance of the field over desired sub-regions. Application of the technique is demonstrated for SST retrievals from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensors. Comparison of the functional form with the data from which it was derived demonstrates how the technique can potentially help to identify small observational artifacts such as MODIS scan striping and residual cloud contamination. Integrals of the interpolating functions over successively larger spatial scales successfully emulate the retrieved SST at the different effective spatial resolutions and the second moments are consistent with the direct sample variances, and hence representative of the spatial SST variability of the available finer-resolution observations over the coarser scales. Using the approach, the variability of 1-km-resolution SST observations on open ocean grids of both 5- and 25 km resolution is found to be similar to 0.07 K. In regions of sharper gradients such as associated with strong localized diurnal warming, the variability within 25-km-resolution grids increases to as much as 0.4 K for sampling at 1 km resolution. The variability of 1-km observations on a 25-km-resolution grid is about 2.4 times greater than that on a 5-km-resolution grid. Broader application of the technique globally could help better quantify regional variations in the spatial variability, which would subsequently improve uncertainty estimates for existing satellite-based SST products.

AB The subglacial hydrology of tidewater glaciers is a key but poorly understood component of the complex ice ocean system, which affects sea level rise. As it is extremely difficult to access the interior of a glacier, our knowledge relies mostly on the observation of input variables such as air temperature, and output variables such as the ice flow velocities reflecting the englacial water pressure, and the dynamics of plumes reflecting the discharge of meltwater into the ocean. In this study we use a cost-effective Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to monitor the daily movements of Bowdoin Glacier, north-west Greenland, and the dynamics of its main plume. Using Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry and feature-tracking techniques, we obtained 22 high-resolution ortho-images and 19 velocity fields at the calving front for 12 days in July 2016. Our results show a two-day-long speed-up event (up to 170%) caused by an increase in buoyant subglacial forces with a strong spatial variability revealing that enhanced acceleration is an indication of shallow bedrock. Further, we used the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) method to analyze water flow from successive UAV images taken while flying over the main plume of the glacier. We found that PIV successfully captures the area of radially diverging flow of the plume, and provides information on spatial and time variability as no other remote sensing technique can. Most interestingly, the active part of the plume features pulsating water jets at the time scale of seconds, and is 1 to 5 times smaller than its visual footprint defined by the iceberg-free area. Combined with an ice flow model or a non-steady plume model, our approach has the potential to generate a novel set of input data to gather information about the depth of the bedrock, the discharge of meltwater, or the subglacial melting rate of tidewater glaciers.

AB Floodplain areas belong to the most diverse, dynamic and complex ecological habitats of the terrestrial portion of the Earth. Spatial and temporal quantification of floodplain dynamics is needed for assessing the impacts of hydromorphological controls on river ecosystems. However, estimation of land cover dynamics in a post-classification setting is hindered by a high contribution of classification errors. A possible solution relies on the selection of specific information of the change map, instead of increasing the overall classification accuracy. In this study, we analyze the capabilities of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), the associated classification processes and their respective accuracies to extract a robust estimate of floodplain dynamics. We show that an estimation of dynamics should be built on specific land cover interfaces to be robust against classification errors and should include specific features depending on the season-sensor coupling. We use five different sets of features and determine the optimal combination to use information largely based on blue and infrared bands with the support of texture and point cloud metrics at leaf-off conditions. In this post-classification setting, the best observation of dynamics can be achieved by focusing on the gravel-water interface. The semi-supervised approach generated error of 10% of observed changes along highly dynamic reaches using these two land cover classes. The results show that a robust quantification of floodplain land cover dynamics can be achieved by high-resolution remote sensing.

AB Alluvial fans are important depositional landforms that offer valuable records of terrestrial sedimentation history if their surfaces can be mapped and dated accurately. Unfortunately, as this often depends on detailed field mapping and intensive absolute dating techniques, it can be a challenging, expensive and time-consuming exercise. In this study, we demonstrate that quantitative information about the ages of alluvial fan surfaces in Owens Valley, California, is recorded by Landsat-8 multispectral satellite imagery. We show that systematic changes in the wavelength-dependent brightness of fan surfaces occur gradually over a timescale of similar to 100 kyr in this semi-arid setting, and are highly correlated with known deposit ages. Using spectro-radiometry and X-ray diffraction analysis of sediment samples collected in the field, we interpret that surface reflectance evolves primarily in response to the in-situ production of secondary illite and iron oxide by weathering in this landscape. Furthermore, we demonstrate that first-order predictions of absolute fan surface age can be derived from multispectral imagery when an initial age calibration is available. These findings suggest that multispectral imagery, such as Landsat data, can be used (i) for preliminary mapping of alluvial fans prior to detailed field work and before choosing sampling sites for conventional dating techniques, and (ii) to extend age models to undated neighbouring surfaces with equivalent physical properties, once an age-brightness calibration has been established.

AB Remote sensing based monitoring of deforestation in the tropics is crucial to better understand global land use change and related changes in ecosystem service provision and to inform governments and civil society on the effectiveness their forest protection policies. In Brazil, deforestation has been closely coupled to the expansion of grazing and cropping systems primarily in the tropical forest, but no spatially explicit high resolution database on deforestation exists that captures tropical forest clearing prior to 2000. The open Landsat archive provides > 45 years of imagery and is well suited for wall-to-wall assessments of historic deforestation dynamics which are valuable to policy development and environmental impact assessments. Image analysis procedures for reconstructing long-term deforestation dynamics over large areas need to cope with regions and time periods for which the archive contains heterogeneous data densities on a yearly and decadal basis. We create for the first time yearly 30 m maps of long term, annual deforestation dynamics (LTAD) covering the period from 1984 to 2014 for Path and Mato Grosso, two Brazilian federal states that cover much of the Brazilian arc-of-deforestation. Our results provide valuable insights into historic deforestation trends, with annually increasing deforestation from 1990 to 1999 for both Para and Mato Grosso. Peak deforestation occurred in 2004 after which deforestation leveled off - with a more pronounced decrease in Mato Grosso than in Path. Contrary to Mato Grosso, Para again experienced increasing annual forest clearing in recent years. For the time period after 2000, we provide an indepth comparison with two widely used products, the Brazilian PRODES and the Global Forest Change maps (GFC, Hansen et al., 2013). Our deforestation estimates (407,000 +/- 42,000 km(2) at 95% confidence level) are above those provided by PRODES, while GFC results are closer to our estimates for the comparison period. Recent PRODES estimates are consistently below our and the GFC results. Overall, our results exemplify the potential of open image archives for multi-decadal, wall-to-wall and fine grain reconstruction of forest change. The presented approach prototypes similar assessments of tropical forest dynamics globally faced with issues of data scarcity.

AB The Mediterranean Sea exhibits a strong basin and regional scale phytoplankton variability correlated to its semi-enclosed nature, complex orography and the variety of physical and chemical processes that regulate its productivity. Herein, using 17 years of ocean-color composites, we investigate differences in the regional patterns of interannual variability in satellite-derived chlorophyll (Chl), a proxy for phytoplankton biomass. A neural network classification, based on the Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) analysis in the time domain, is used to reveal regions of similar temporal variability of Chl in the Mediterranean Sea. Characteristic temporal patterns extracted by the SOM analysis show different scales of variation that can be related to already identified oceanographic features and biogeochemical variability in the Mediterranean Sea. Clear differences are noticed between regions located in the Western basin and Adriatic Sea, where rivers, winter mixing and winds are known to drive variations in primary production at regional scale and regions located in the Eastern basin, represented by a large and rather homogeneous region. Using the SOM-defined characteristic temporal patterns of Chl, we analyzed the regional influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the long-term ( > 1 year) Chl variability. Our results indicate that NAO has more influence in the Chl variations occurring in regions located in the Western basin whereas ENSO exhibits higher impact on the central Mediterranean and Eastern basin during its positive phase. Both NAO and ENSO show non-stationary coherence with Mediterranean Chl. The analysis also reveals a sharp regime shift occurring in 2004-2007, when NAO changed from positive to negative values. This shift particularly affected the winter phytoplankton biomass and it is indicative of climate driven ecosystem-level changes in the Mediterranean Sea. Our results stablish a regional connection between interannual phytoplankton variability exhibited in different regions of the Mediterranean Sea and climate variations.

AB Clouds and cloud shadows block land surface information in optical satellite images. Accurate detection of clouds and cloud shadows can help exclude these contaminated pixels in further applications. Existing cloud screening methods are challenged by cloudy regions where most of satellite images are contaminated by clouds. To solve this problem for landscapes where the typical frequency of cloud-free observations of a pixel is too small to use existing methods to mask clouds and shadows, this study presents a new Automatic Time-Series Analysis (ATSA) method to screen clouds and cloud shadows in multi-temporal optical images. ATSA has five main steps: (1) calculate cloud and shadow indices to highlight cloud and cloud shadow information; (2) obtain initial cloud mask by unsupervised classifiers; (3) refine initial cloud mask by analyzing time series of a cloud index; (4) predict the potential shadow mask using geometric relationships; and (5) refine the potential shadow mask by analyzing time series of a shadow index. Compared with existing methods, ATSA needs fewer predefined parameters, does not require a thermal infrared band, and is more suitable for areas with persistent clouds. The performance of ATSA was tested with Landsat-8 OLI images, Landsat-4 MSS images, and Sentinel-2 images in three sites. The results were compared with a popular method, Function of Mask (Fmask), which has been adopted by USGS to produce Landsat cloud masks. These tests show that ATSA and Fmask can get comparable cloud and shadow masks in some of the tested images. However, ATSA can consistently obtain high accuracy in all images, while Fmask has large omission or commission errors in some images. The quantitative accuracy was assessed using manual cloud masks of 15 images. The average cloud producer's accuracy of these 15 images is as high as 0.959 and the average shadow producer's accuracy reaches 0.901. Given that it can be applied to old satellite sensors and it is capable for cloudy regions, ATSA is a valuable supplement to the existing cloud screening methods.

AB Spatial and temporal information on the structural and chemical properties of tropical forest canopies are key to understanding ecosystem processes. However, such information is usually limited to field studies performed at the plot level (similar to 1 ha). The combination of imaging spectroscopy with physically based radiative transfer (RT) models holds great promise for generalizing and extrapolating insights from plot-based studies to whole landscapes. Here, we tested the capacity of a simplified 3D RT approach to retrieve the structural and chemical traits of individual tree crowns (ITCs) from a highly diverse tropical forest. We first produced two datasets called measured and simulated. The measured dataset was composed of ITC reflectance extracted from sunlit imaging spectroscopy pixels. The simulated dataset was produced using a look-up-table approach and the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model. We then compared the simulated and measured reflectances of ITCs in terms of shape difference by computing the spectral angle. The results showed small disagreements between the simulated and measured reflectances. Such differences impacted neither the spectral variability nor the spectral regions recognized as useful for species discrimination, showing that the spectral angle was a suitable measure of spectral similarity. Simulation robustness was assessed by comparing model parameters obtained by inversion to imaging spectroscopy vegetation indices and the proportion of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), green photosynthetic vegetation (GV) and shade estimated within ITCs. DART canopy structural parameters were related to NPV (R-2 = 0.71), GV (R-2 = 0.78) and shade (R-2 = 0.55). DART canopy foliar parameters such as chlorophyll and carotenoids were related to the ratio of TCARI/OSAVI (R-2 = 0.80) indices and the simple ratio between reflectances at 515 nm and 570 nm (R-515/R-570) (R-2 = 0.54), respectively. Species-related differences in NPV, GV and shade were explained by variations in crown architectural characteristics. The simulation framework employed in this study can be applied to retrieve structural and chemical traits of ITCs from other areas in which high-resolution imaging spectroscopy data are available.

TI Applicability of Earth Observation chlorophyll-<i>a</i> data in

AB Earth Observation (EO) offers spatially and temporally unique data for generating information required under various environmental regulations for assessing the status of surface waters. These requirements, which are laid down in, for example, European Union directives and the Clean Water Act in the United States, share two core elements with respect to status assessments: 1) the status assessment is done using discrete classes, typically for water bodies, sub-areas or critical sites representative for certain area of interest, and 2) phytoplankton chlorophyll a (chl-a) is one of the main variables considered. We analysed the benefits of using chl-a concentrations derived from EO data for the status assessments specified in the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Our study focused especially on EO observations' ability to capture extreme and transient events (such as instances of cyanobacteria blooms) more frequently than the monitoring-station data conventionally employs. The accuracy of EO-based chl-a assessment was studied for, in all, 129 Finnish water bodies in the area of the Baltic Sea, in Northern Europe. Natural conditions in this coastal area particularly its multitude of small bays, numerous estuaries, and mosaic of islands impose exceptionally strict requirements for an EO instrument's spatial resolution. The analysis revealed that an instrument with a 300 m resolution, such as the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) or Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), can be used to estimate the water quality in 62% of these water bodies. Processing of MERIS data into chl-a concentrations by means of a FUB inversion model demonstrated good accuracy relative to monitoring stations' measurements for the open-water season in 2003-2011. This extensive dataset showed a 23% difference in modal values between EO- and station sampling -based chl-a concentrations. The bias in EO chl-a estimates was found to increase with low Secchi disk depth, elevated turbidity, and the presence of intensive phytoplankton blooms. The monitoring-station and EO data showed similar distributions of chl-a observations for a given day and location, a finding that supports the comprehensive use of EO-derived chl-a concentrations in assessment. For determination of a water body's status, the EO data required but also allowed for statistical analysis that differs from what has typically been utilised with sparse measurements from monitoring-station data. The geometric mean or the mode of the EO observations was found to represent the main bulk of the chl-a concentrations well statistically. In contrast, the arithmetic mean of EO observations yields chl-a concentrations that are roughly 1.1-1.6 mu g/I higher and hence can lead to over-estimation in the associated status assessment. This paper also presents a new approach applicable for evaluating the validity of EO-based algorithms for any coastal water area requiring assessment. With this quality-grade (QG) method, the EO chl-a estimation accuracy is rated in terms of three grades, with water bodies taken as the evaluation units. For this, the method utilises statistical differences between EO and station-sampling chl-a concentrations and applies background information on optical properties obtained from measurements at routine-monitoring stations. The QG method showed the EO-based chl-a accuracy to suffice for assessing the status of 65% of the coastal water bodies examined. At concentrations representing the threshold for the target of "good status" under the WFD, the EO approach produced 0.
   6 mu g/I higher chl-a values than the stations' sampling did. The MERIS results point to clear benefits of using OLCI-based status assessment throughout the Sentinel-3 era.

AB Information on crop phenological development stages such as emergence, flowering, fruiting, maturing and senescence is essential for crop production surveillance and yield prediction. It has long been related to optical spectral signatures such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or spectral shifts in the red-edge range. In recent years, more efforts have been made to explore the sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly polarimetric SAR signatures, to crop biophysical parameters or phenological stages. In this study, phenological metrics of canola (Brassica napus) and spring wheat (Triticum spp.) are related with temporal evolution of polarimetric SAR parameters derived from the C-band RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric SAR data. Both crops are very common in north eastern Ontario, Canada, but have very anatomically different development processes. From multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data acquired in three consecutive years (2012-2014), significant correlations were observed between a number of SAR polarimetric parameters and the growth parameters of both crops. Strong correlation was observed between plant height and the Alpha angle of the Cloude-Pottier decomposition, with the R-2 of 0.91 and 0.66 for canola and wheat, respectively. The R-2 increased when the polarimetric parameters were smoothed in the time domain (R-2 of 0.98 for canola and 0.88 for wheat). Strong correlation was also observed for the two crops between the effective leaf area index (LAIe) and the Beta angle, and between days-after-seeding (DAS) and a combination of the Alpha and the Beta angles. These findings show that multi-temporal C-band polarimetric SAR parameters could be used for tracking crop phonological development stages.

AB We analyse ten years of QuikSCAT satellite surface winds to statistically characterize the spatio-temporal variability of the westward mountain-gap wind jets over the northern Red Sea. These wind jets bring relatively cold and dry air from the Arabian Desert, increasing heat loss and evaporation over the region similar to cold-air outbreaks from mid and subpolar latitudes. QuikSCAT captures the spatial structure of the wind jets and agrees well with in situ observations from a heavily instrumented mooring in the northern Red Sea. The local linear correlations between QuikSCAT and in situ winds are 0.96 (speed) and 0.85 (direction). QuikSCAT also reveals that cross-axis winds such as the mountain-gap wind jets are a major component of the regional wind variability. The cross-axis wind pattern appears as the second (or third) mode in the four vector Empirical Orthogonal Function analyses we performed, explaining between 6% to 11% of the wind variance. Westward wind jets are typical in winter, especially in December and January, but with strong interannual variability. Several jets can occur simultaneously and cover a large latitudinal range of the northern Red Sea, which we call large-scale westward events. QuikSCAT recorded 18 large-scale events over ten years, with duration between 3 to 8 days and strengths varying from 3-4 to 9-10 m/s. These events cause large changes in the wind stress curl pattern, imposing a remarkable sequence of positive and negative curl along the Red Sea main axis, which might be a wind forcing mechanism for the oceanic mesoscale circulation.

AB A new method was developed for reconstructing the geometric structure of large plants such as trees at the leaf scale by utilizing terrestrial LiDAR data. The primary goal of the work was to develop a feasible means for accurately and rapidly reconstructing or "digitizing" entire trees in order to specify the position, orientation, and size of every leaf in digital tree models that provide geometric inputs for high-resolution biophysical models or analyses. As with any optical measurement technique, a primary challenge is accurately accounting for plant matter that is occluded from view of the sensor. The present method is termed "semi-direct" because it uses a triangulation procedure to approximately directly reconstruct as many leaves as possible that are in view of the scanner. For plant matter obstructed from view, a statistical backfilling procedure was used to add additional leaves such that the three-dimensional distribution of leaf area and orientation of the reconstructed plant matched that of the actual plant on average. In a best case scenario such as when leaf density is low, nearly all leaf area is directly reconstructed from the scan and the branch and clumping structure is preserved within the reconstruction. In the worst case scenario such as when the leaf density is very high and nearly all leaves are occluded from view of the scanner, only a small fraction of leaves can be directly reconstructed, but at a minimum the distribution of leaf area and the leaf angle distribution across the reconstructed plant will be consistent with that of the actual plant. Unlike many other approaches, the present method does not rely on the woody matter of the plant to provide a skeleton for reconstruction, and can be used in dense plants where little woody matter is visible from the scanner.

AB Forest canopy gaps play an important role in forest dynamics. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data provide demonstrated capacity to systematically and accurately detect and map canopy gaps over large forest areas. Digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) is emerging as an alternative, lower-cost source of three-dimensional information for characterizing forest structure and modelling forest inventory attributes. In this study we compared the relative capacities of ALS and DAP data to map canopy gaps in a complex coastal temperate rainforest on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. We applied fixed-and variable-height threshold approaches for gap detection using both ALS and DAP data, and validated outcomes using independent data derived via visual image interpretation. Overall accuracies for ALS-derived gaps were 96.50% and 89.50% for the fixed-and variable height threshold approaches respectively, compared to 59.50% and 50.00% for the DAP-derived gaps, with DAP data having large errors of omission ( > 88%). We found that 70% of ALS-derived gaps were identified in old seral stage stands (age > 250 years), while 65% of DAP-derived gaps were located in early seral stage stands (age < 40 years). For the DAP data, gap detection accuracy was 80% in early seral stands, compared to 50% in old seral stands. In contrast, ALS detection accuracy varied by only similar to 6% between early and old seral stages. We compared detected gaps using a variety of metrics and found significant differences in the number and average size of gaps detected using ALS and DAP data. Using the fixed-height threshold, the ALS data identified 16 times more gaps and 6.5 times more gap area than the DAP data, with a mean ALS-derived gap size that was half that of the DAP data. The average amount of overlap between ALS- and DAP-detected gaps was 13.26% and 42.90% for the variable and fixed thresholds, respectively. We attribute these differences in gap detection to the nature of the DAP data itself, which characterizes primarily the outer canopy envelope, as well as to the confounding effects of canopy complexity and related occlusions and shadows on image matching algorithms. We conclude that DAP data do not provide analogous results to ALS data for canopy gap detection and mapping in coastal temperate rainforests, and that ALS data enable markedly superior accuracy and detailed gap characterizations.

AB The use of satellite-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) data and statistical modeling provides a promising approach to estimating PM2.5 concentrations for a large region. However, few studies have conducted high spatial resolution assessments of ground-level PM2.5 for China at the national scale, due to the limitations of high-resolution AOD products. To generate high-resolution PM2.5 for the entirety of mainland China, a combined 3 km AOD dataset was produced by blending the newly released 3 km-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Dark Target AOD data with the 10 km-resolution MODIS Deep Blue AOD data. Using this dataset, surface PM2.5 measurements, and ancillary information, a space-time regression model that is an improved geographically and temporally weighted regression(GTWR) with an interior point algorithm (IPA) based efficient mechanism for selecting optimal parameter values, was developed to estimate a large set of daily PM2.5 concentrations. Comparisons with the popular spatiotemporal models (daily geographically weighted regression and two-stage model) indicated that the proposed GTWR model, with an R-2 of 0.80 in cross-validation (CV), performs notably better than the two other models, which have an R-2 in CV of 0.71 and 0.72, respectively. The use of the combined 3-km high resolution AOD data was found not only to present detailed particle gradients, but also to enhance model performance (CV R-2 is only 0.32 for the non-combined AOD data). Furthermore, the GTWR's ability to predict PM2.5 for days without PM2.5-AOD paired samples and to generate historical PM2.5 estimates was demonstrated. As a result, fine-scale PM2.5 maps over China were generated, and several PM2.5 hotspots were identified. Therefore, it becomes possible to generate daily high-resolution PM2.5 estimates over a large area using GTWR, due to its synergy of spatial and temporal dimensions in the data and its ability to extend the temporal coverage of PM2.5 observations.

AB Rivers are essential to the Earth's water cycle and deeply impact many human societies and ecosystems, yet they are currently monitored poorly at the global scale. In-situ gauging stations are distributed sparsely and heterogeneously and do not cover much of the world, whereas remotely sensed images are spatially and temporally dense and available globally. Remotely sensed multispectral images, such as the ones acquired by Landsat missions, are available to enable the analysis and surveying of rivers using suitable algorithms. However, existing algorithms are limited in ways that restrict the coverage of the produced results and that prevent the automated analysis of river networks at large scales over short periods of time. Ideally, river maps should be as "live" as possible, e.g., computed quickly and continuously as new Earth imaging data becomes available. Towards advancing progress on this problem, we describe an automated river analysis and mapping engine, RivaMap, that enables the computation of large-scale hydrography data sets from remotely sensed data in a short period of time. RivaMap facilitates water resource management by providing tools to delineate rivers and to estimate their width. As a practical application of RivaMap, we present a continental-scale centerline and width data set of North American rivers, that is automatically computed on Landsat data. We validate our mapping engine by comparing the RivaMap-generated data to a similar data set, NARWidth, and also to in-situ measurements. Our experimental results show that RivaMap is able to efficiently and accurately extract rivers from remotely sensed images at large scales. The outcomes of this research, the software, and the computed exemplary data set are publicly available. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB South East Asia region is a triple hotspot of carbon, biodiversity, and forest degradation. The latter is leading to heterogeneous forest landscapes with predominant and varying intensity of human modification. Optical Earth observation data offers the most feasible and accessible means of mapping and monitoring the forest cover heterogeneity in this region. Further, difficulties in ground data collection in this region present the need for more robust physically-based interpretation of satellite data which extends beyond simple empirical correlations of reflectance data with forest characteristics. We present an application of forest reflectance parameterization based on spectral invariants in lowland humid tropical forests of Malaysian Borneo. Our framework combined field measurements (hemispherical photos) of canopy structure, radiative transfer modelling at leaf (PROSPECT) and canopy scale (PARAS), and assessments using satellite data (Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, ETM +). Field data were collected representing a gradient of forest degradation within a large-scale experimental landscape. Results showed limited ability of Landsat-class satellites to uncover the full gradient of forest degradation in this biome due to similarity in canopy structure as characterized by effective canopy cover, leaf area index, and angular profile of canopy gap fraction. Our findings, however, showed strong expression of leaf optical properties at canopy level. This supports the feasibility to remotely measure canopy biochemistry in dense humid tropical rainforests at medium spatial resolution using freely available Landsat-class satellites, and forthcoming hyperspectral satellite missions.

AB Grasslands are one of the ecosystems that have been strongly affected by anthropogenic impacts. The state-ofthe-art in monitoring changes in grassland species composition is to conduct repeated plot-based vegetation surveys that assess the occurrence and cover of plants. These plot-based surveys are typically limited to comparably small areas and the quality of the cover estimates depends strongly on the experience and performance of the surveyors. Here, we investigate the possibility of a semi-automated, image-based method for cover estimates, by analyzing the applicability of very high spatial resolution hyperspectral data to classify grassland species at the level of individuals. This individual-oriented approach is seen as an alternative to community oriented remote sensing depicting canopy reflectance as the total of mixed species reflectance. An AISA + imaging spectrometer mounted on a scaffold was used to scan 1 m(2) grassland plots and assess the impact of four sources of variation on the predicted species cover: (1) the spatial resolution of the scans, (2) complexity, i.e. species number and structural diversity, (3) the species cover and (4) the share of functional types (graminoids and forbs). Classifications were conducted using a support vector machine classification with a linear kemel, obtaining a median Kappa of 0.8. Species cover estimations reached median r(2) and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.6 and 6.2% respectively. We found that the spatial resolution and diversity level (mainly structural diversity) were the most important sources of variation affecting the performance of the proposed approach. A spatial resolution below 1 cm produced relatively good models for estimating species-specific coverages (r(2) = similar to 0.6; RMSE = similar to 7.5%) while predictions using pixel sizes over that threshold failed in this individual-oriented approach (r(2) = similar to 0.17; RMSE = similar to 20.7%). Areas with low inter-species overlap were better suited than areas with frequent inter-species overlap. We conclude that the application of very high resolution hyperspectral remote sensing in environments with low structural heterogeneity is suited for individual-oriented mapping of grassland plant species.

AB Arctic environments provide a challenging ground for geological mapping and mineral exploration. Inaccessibility complicates ground surveys and the presence of ice, vegetation, and lichens hinders supportive remote sensing surveys. Spectral mixing of lichens and bare rock can shift the wavelength position of characteristic absorption features, thereby complicating the spectral mapping of minerals and lithologies. The extent to which diagnostic rock features are preserved despite the presence of lichens is of major concern in remotely sensed geological studies and estimates of the critical level of lichen coverage, below which spectral features of the mineral substrate can still be identified, are needed. We investigated how surficial lichen cover affects the characteristics of shortwave infrared (SWIR) mineral absorption features and the efficacy of automated absorption feature extraction. For this purpose, mixed spectra were synthetically generated from laboratory spectra of common rock forming SWIR absorbing minerals and lichens. Wavelength displacements of characteristic absorption features for each mixed spectrum were then analyzed as a function of percentage lichen cover. Distinctive trends were identified that can be used in future analysis: The strong spectral features of mica group minerals around 2200 and 2340-2350 nm maintain their integrity for up to 30% lichen cover, despite the related shift toward shorter wavelengths for higher percentage lichen cover. In contrast, very weak absorption bands around 2440 nm in (white) micas spectra are completely obscured for a lichen cover of >= 50%. Our observations suggest that the chlorite feature around 2250 nm is shifted toward longer wavelengths and the depth of this feature as well as the contrast between lichen and substrate spectra define the amount of lichen needed to mask it. Furthermore, lichens induce a spectral shift towards shorter wavelengths for the features around 2320 nm for the rocks containing amphibole, chlorite, carbonate and serpentine group minerals. In addition, no wavelength displacement is observed for chlorite, biotite and phlogopite features around 2380 nm in mixtures with lichens. By quantifying lichen cover effects on mineral absorption features, our study highlights the importance of being precautious in any interpretation in areas characterized by abundant lichen-covered outcrops. This can be of significant importance for mineral and deposit vectoring as the presence of abundant lichen coverage causing slightly shifted features for a given spectra can be erroneously identified as a path to a deposit (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Near-real-time flood maps are essential to organize and coordinate emergency services' response actions during flooding events. Thanks to its capacity to acquire synoptic and detailed data during day and night, and in all weather conditions, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite remote sensing is considered one of the best tools for the acquisition of flood mapping information. However, specific factors contributing to SAR backscatter in urban environments, such as shadow and layover effects, and the presence of water surface-like radar response areas, complicate the detection of flood water pixels. This paper describes an approach for near-real-time flood mapping in urban and rural areas. The innovative aspect of the approach is its reliance on the combined use of very-high-resolution SAR satellite imagery (C-band, HH polarization) and hydraulic data, specifically flood return period data estimated for each point of the floodplain. This approach was tested and evaluated using two case studies of the 2011 Richelieu River flood (Canada) observed by the very-high-resolution RADARSAT-2 sensor. In both case studies, the algorithm proved capable of detecting flooding in urban areas with good accuracy, identifying approximately 87% of flooded pixels correctly. The associated false negative and false positive rates are approximately 14%. In rural areas, 97% of flooded pixels were correctly identified, with false negative rates close to 3% and false positive rates between 3% and 35%. These results highlight the capacity of flood return period data to overcome limitations associated with SAR-based flood detection in urban environments, and the relevance of their use in combination with SAR C-band imagery for precise flood extent mapping in urban and rural environments in a crisis management context.

AB The magnitude of the global terrestrial carbon pool and related fluxes to and from the atmosphere are still poorly known. The European Space Agency P-band radar BIOMASS mission will help to reduce this uncertainty by providing unprecedented information on the distribution of forest above-ground biomass (AGB), particularly in the tropics where the gaps are greatest and knowledge is most needed. Mission selection was made in full knowledge of coverage restrictions over Europe, North and Central America imposed by the US Department of Defense Space Objects Tracking Radar (SOTR) stations. Under these restrictions, only 3% of AGB carbon stock coverage is lost in the tropical forest biome, with this biome representing 66% of global AGB carbon stocks in 2005. The loss is more significant in the temperate (72%), boreal (37%) and subtropical (29%) biomes, with these accounting for approximately 12%, 15% and 7%, respectively, of the global forest AGB carbon stocks. In terms of global carbon cycle modelling, there is minimal impact in areas of high AGB density, since mainly lower biomass forests in cooler climates are affected. In addition, most areas affected by the SOTR stations are located in industrialized countries with well-developed national forest inventories, so that extensive information on AGB is already available. Hence the main scientific objectives of the BIOMASS mission are not seriously compromised. Furthermore, several space sensors that can estimate AGB in lower biomass forests are in orbit or planned for launch between now and the launch of BIOMASS in 2021, which will help to fill the gaps in mission coverage.

AB Proliferation of different total water storage (TWS) change products from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, including the newly released mascon solution, warrants detailed analysis of their uncertainties and an urgent need to optimize different products for obtaining an elevated understanding of TWS changes globally. The three cornered hat method is used to quantify uncertainties in TWS changes from GRACE observations, land surface models, and global hydrological models, indicating that the WaterGap Global Hydrological Model (WGHM)-based TWS changes show the lowest uncertainty over sixty basins covering a range of climate settings and levels of human activities globally. Bayesian model averaging (BMA) using WGHM TWS output for training (2003-2006) is subsequently used to merge TWS changes from various GRACE products. Results indicate that the BMA-based TWS changes show the highest consistency with the WGHM output for the validation period (2007-2009) in terms of the highest medium of the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient of 0.714 among all TWS change products for the sixty basins. The mascon solution shows a medium of NSE of 0.682, higher than other GRACE TWS change products. Analysis of spatiotemporal variability in BMA-based TWS changes and the mascon solution indicates that higher depletion rates for the 13-year period (Apr 2002-Mar 2015) occurred over major aquifers due to groundwater withdrawals for irrigation (e.g., Tigris, Central Valley, Ganges, upper Arkansas, and Indus), basins subject to great glacier and snow melting (e.g., Yukon, Fraser, and eastern Ganges), the north Caspian Sea (e.g., Don and Ural), and the Caspian Sea. Significant increasing trends in TWS are found over west (e.g., Gambia and Niger) and South Africa (e.g., Zambezi), South America (e.g., Essequibo), North America (e.g., Koksoak and Missouri), central India (e.g., Narmada and Godavari), the north Tibetan Plateau, and the middle Yangtze River basin. Empirical Orthogonal Function decomposition is used to investigate spatiotemporal variations in the GRACE mascon solution-based TWS changes during the study period, showing a detailed pattern of increasing and decreasing long-term trends, interannual and seasonal variations in TWS over the global land surface.

AB Understanding the role of estuarine-carbon fluxes is essential to improve estimates of the global carbon budget. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in aquatic carbon cycling. The chromophoric fraction of DOM (CDOM) can be readily detected via in situ and remotely-sensed optical measurements. DOM properties, including CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm (a(g)412) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations were examined in Apalachicola Bay, a national estuarine research reserve located in the northeast Gulf of Mexico, using in situ and satellite observations during the spring and fall of 2015. Synoptic and accurate representation of estuarine-scale processes using satellite ocean color imagery necessitates the removal of atmospheric contribution (similar to 90%) to signals received by satellite sensors to successfully link to in situ observations. Three atmospheric correction schemes (e.g., Standard NIR correction, Iterative NIR correction, and SWIR correction) were tested first to find a suitable correction scheme for the VIIRS imagery in low to moderately turbid Apalachicola Bay. The iterative NIR correction performed well, and validation showed high correlation (R-2 = 0.95, N = 25) against in situ light measurements. A VIIRS-based CDOM algorithm was developed (R-2 = 0.87, N = 9) and validated (R-2 = 0.76, N = 20, RMSE = 0.29 m(-1)) against in situ observations. Subsequently, a(g)412 was used as a proxy of DOC in March (DOC = 1.08 + 0.94 x a(g)412, R-2 = 0.88, N = 13) and in November (DOC = 1.61 + 1.33 x a(g)412, R-2 = 0.83, N = 24) to derive DOC maps that provided synoptic views of DOC distribution, sources, and their transport to the coastal waters during the wet and dry seasons. The estimated DOC stocks were similar to 3.71 x 10(6) kg C in March and similar to 4.07 x 10(6) kg C in November over an area of similar to 560 km(2). Volume flux (out of the bay) almost doubled for March 24 (735 m(3) s(-1)) relative to November 4 (378 m(3) s(-1)). However, estimates of DOC fluxes exported out of the bay from model-derived currents and satellite-derived DOC were only marginally greater in March (0.163 x 10(6) kg C d(-1)) than in November (0.124 x 10(6) kg C d(-1)) and reflected greater DOC stocks in the fall. The combination of satellite-, field-, and model-based observations revealed the strong linkage between the Apalachicola River plume, a major source of DOM, and the overall hydrodynamic forcing that controlled distributions of CDOM abundance, DOC concentration, stocks, and fluxes in the bay.

AB Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) represents one of the most powerful techniques for Earth's surface deformation processes' monitoring, especially for long-term evolution phenomena. In this work, a dataset of 34 TerraSAR-X StripMap images (October 2013-October 2014) has been processed by two PSI techniques- Coherent Pixel Technique-Temporal Sublook Coherence (CPT-TSC) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS)- in order to study the evolution of a slow-moving landslide which occurred on February 23, 2012 in the Papanice hamlet (Crotone municipality, southern Italy) and induced by a significant rainfall event (185 mm in three days). The mass movement caused structural damage (buildings' collapse), and destruction of utility lines (gas, water and electricity) and roads. The results showed analogous displacement rates (30-40 mm/yr along the Line of Sight- LOS-of the satellite) with respect to the pre-failure phase (2008-2010) analyzed in previous works. Both approaches allowed detect the landslide-affected area, however the higher density of targets identified by means of CPTTSC enabled to analyze in detail the slope behavior in order to design possible mitigation interventions. For this aim, a slope stability analysis has been carried out, considering the comparison between groundwater oscillations and time-series of displacement. Hence, the crucial role of the interaction between rainfall and groundwater level has been inferred for the landslide triggering. In conclusion, we showed that the integration of geotechnical and remote sensing approaches can be seen as the best practice to support stakeholders to design remedial works. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Many different blended sea surface temperature (SST) analyses are currently available and exhibit significant differences in the high latitude regions. It is challenging for users to determine which of these products is most accurate and best suited for their applications. Nine different SST analyses and two single sensor satellite products are compared with independent observations from Upper Temperature of the polar Oceans (UpTempO) buoys deployed in the Beaufort Sea in 2012 and 2013 during the Marginal Ice Zone Processes Experiment (MIZOPEX). The relative skill of the different SST products is evaluated using a combination of Taylor diagrams and two different verification scores that weight different statistical measures. Skill thresholds based on satellite accuracy requirements are chosen to map products with similar performance into three discrete skill categories: excellent, good, and poor. Results are presented for three subsets of the buoys corresponding to different regimes: coastal waters, northerly waters, and extreme weather. The presence of strong thermal gradients and cloudiness posed problems for the SST products, while in more homogeneous regions the performance was improved and more similar among products. The impact of variations in the ice mask between the SST products was mostly inconsequential. While the relative performance of the analyses varied with regime, overall, the best performing analyses for this region and period included the NOM Optimal Interpolation SST (OISST), the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) SST, and the Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) Multi-Product Ensemble (GMPE).

AB Since the opening of the Landsat archive, the availability of remote sensing data has increased dramatically, and algorithms that can interpret large time series of satellite imagery are in rapid development as additions to the decades of interpretation of remotely-sensed images. To date, processing of these massive data repositories has focused mostly on tracing forest growth and loss across very large areas within pre-defined study periods. Despite these very considerable advances, there is a need for methodology that could allow analysts to use their own specific land-cover categories of interest, and update existing land-cover classifications either forward or backward to a desired point in time. Here we demonstrate an algorithm (Bayesian Updating of Land-Cover, or BULC) developed for the continuous updating of land-cover classifications through time in large data sets. The BULC algorithm is designed to permit users to build new classifications or update existing classifications based on long streams of imagery, but with minimal storage and memory requirements. The algorithm ingests a sequence of classified land-cover data for a user-specified set of detectable classes, and maintains a continually updated estimate of land-cover probabilities and the most probable class at all time points along the sequence. We tested this algorithm in central Quebec with Landsat 8 imagery for summer 2013, when a series of large fires erupted and burned through forests. In this very dynamic setting, many of the summer's images were contaminated by ordinary standards, yet parts of the region could be seen through the clouds, smoke, and haze of each image. Across 11 dates of widely varying quality, BULC tracked the fires, ignored contaminated image information, and mapped fire borders consistently throughout the summer, autumn, and subsequent winter and spring. Building on images having a median accuracy of 78% and 8% NoData, the BULC algorithm created 11 sequenced land-cover maps each having more than 90% overall accuracy and covering the entire study area. BULC's classifications mapped each of the land-cover categories with user's and producer's accuracies that compared well to the best individual images used as input, while accurately tracking land-cover change that occurred between those infrequent clear images. As we leave remote sensing's data-poor era and enter a period with many images of Earth's surface supplied by multiple sensors over a short period of time, the BULC algorithm may help to sift through images of varying quality to extract the most useful information for mapping time series of land-cover classifications.

AB Wildfires shape the distribution and structure of vegetation across the inland northwestern United States. However, fire activity is expected to increase given the current rate of climate change, with uncertain outcomes. A fire impact that has not been widely addressed is the development of unburned islands; areas within the fire perimeter that do not burn. These areas function as critical ecological refugia for biota during or following wildfires, but they have been largely ignored in methodological studies of remote sensing assessing fire severity under the assumption that they will be detected by algorithms for delineating fire perimeters. Our objective was to develop a model for classifying unburned areas within wildfire perimeters using moderate resolution satellite (i.e., Landsat) and ancillary data. We performed field observations at locations that were unburned or lightly burned within the perimeters of 12 wildfires that burned in 2012 and 2014, and augmented this with field data previously acquired on another seven wildfires across the study region. We used randomForest and classification trees to separate burned from unburned locations with high overall classification accuracy (91.7% and 89.2%, for randomForest and classification tree methods respectively). Classification accuracy was significantly higher than the semi-automated classification products from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program. After application of the most parsimonious and accurate classification tree model, we found that the average unburned proportion of the fires was 20% with high variability between fires (standard deviation: 16.4%). The total area of unburned islands in non-forested areas was significantly higher than the total unburned area in forested areas. Accurate detection and delineation of unburned areas is increasingly critical, as some of these unburned areas contain habitat (i.e., wildfire refugia) that are crucial for maintaining biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems, particularly given observed and projected anthropogenic climate change.

AB Our ability to measure and map plant function at multiple ecological scales is critical for understanding current and future changes in Earth's ecosystems and the global carbon budget. Conventional plant functional types (cPFTs) based on a few productivity-related traits have been previously used to simplify and represent major differences in global plant functions, but more recent research has directly focused on the use of functional trait information. Still, sampling limitations have constrained efforts to truly understand the variance and covariance of functional traits globally. Reflectance spectra offer a fast, repeatable, simultaneous measurement of a wide variety of leaf functional traits and could be used to optically define leaf functional types. To evaluate this concept, we measured leaf reflectance from a wide range of species in a diverse set of ecosystems across central and northern California, including observations from multiple individuals, sites, and seasons. Using principal components analysis, we analyzed spectral variation in relation to categorical attributes such as species and cPFTs, as well as to a set of functional trait metrics calculated from the spectra. We found the first three principal components (PCs) to be weakly related to categorical attributes and more strongly related to spectrally-derived functional metrics. Each PC was more strongly associated with different portions of the spectrum and contained different functional information. We applied a hybrid clustering algorithm to the PC coordinates of the observations to define potential optical leaf functional types. Twelve spectral clusters were identified, and these did not correspond directly to either single cPFTs or species. However, each cluster had a unique functional metric profile. Clusters represented both inter- and intra-species and cPFT functional differences driven by taxonomy, trait evolution and environmental responses, demonstrating their value as optical leaf functional types and the value of the clustering approach used here for defining optical types from leaf spectra. Our findings support the notion that cPFTs do not adequately capture differences in leaf function. They demonstrate that spectral measurements can be used to improve both the definition of PFTs as well as our knowledge regarding the covariance of functional traits within these classes.

AB We usually use ground-based solar radiation measurements to validate satellite-derived solar radiation products from kilometer to grid scales. Questions such as, how large is the representativeness error of surface measurements in the validation and how much of the product-measurement difference can be attributed to their inherent differing spatial scales, cast doubts on the suitability of this direct validation approach. In this paper, we will investigate and quantify the representativeness errors of point-scale ground-based measurements using the surface flux observation matrix from HiWATER (Li et al., 2013) and the solar radiation data retrieved from geostationary meteorological satellite (Huang, Li, Ma, & Li, 2016). The current study demonstrates that wildly fluctuating representativeness errors exist which are strongly contingent on the time and space scales of remote sensing products, as well as instant atmospheric conditions. For example, for an area of 5 x 5 km(2) 1.4-8.1% of representativeness errors are found from monthly to "instantaneous" timescales; while for an area of 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid 3.1-8.1% of representativeness errors are seen. Such scale-dependent representativeness errors offer some implications for validations of remote sensing products. On timescales longer than or equal to one day, representativeness errors do not need to be considered for validations of kilometer-level products, but on shorter timescales representativeness errors will affect the validation results to some extent. For instantaneous products with 5 km resolution, our study indicates over 13% of errors can be attributed to the inherent representativeness error, and 30-minute surface measurements are recommended for a routine validation. However, for validations of grid-level products, representativeness errors basically cannot be neglected regardless of timescales. The errors caused by the poor representativeness of surface sites, likely significantly contribute to the large differences between measurements and products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Monitoring crop phenology provides essential information for crop management, as well as for understanding regional to global scale vegetation dynamics. In this study, a hybrid phenology detection method is presented that incorporates the "shape-model fitting" concept of the two-step filtering method and a simulation concept of the crop models to detect the critical vegetative stages and reproductive stages of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybeans (Glycine max L.) from MODIS 250-m Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI) time-series data and 1000-m Land Surface Temperature (LST) data. The method was first developed and tested at the field scale over a ten-year period (2003-2012) for three experimental study sites in eastern Nebraska of USA, where the estimated phenology dates were compared to the ground-based phenology observations for both corn and soybeans. The average root mean square error (RMSE) of phenology stage estimation of the individual development stages across all sites ranged from 1.9 to 43 days for corn and from 1.9 to 4.9 days for soybeans. The approach was then tested at a regional scale over eastern Nebraska and the state of Iowa to evaluate its ability to characterize the spatio-temporal variation of targeted corn and soybean phenology stage dates over a larger area. Quantitative regional assessments were conducted by comparing the estimated crop stage dates with crop developmental stage statistics reported by the USDA NASS Crop Progress Reports (NASS-CPR) for both eastern Nebraska and Iowa. The accuracy of the regional-scale phenology estimation in Iowa (RMSE ranged from 2.6 to 3.9 days for corn and from 3.2 to 3.9 days for soybeans) was slightly lower than in eastern Nebraska (RMSE ranged from 1.8 to 2.9 days for corn and from 1.7 to 2.9 days for soybeans), However, the estimation accuracy in Iowa was still reasonable with the estimated phenology dates being within 4 days or less of the observed dates for both corn and soybeans.

AB The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite (SMOS) was launched in November 2009 and started delivering data in January 2010. The commissioning phase ended in May 2010. Subsequently, the satellite has been in operation for over six years while the retrieval algorithms from Level 1 (L1) to Level 2 (L2) underwent significant evolutions as knowledge improved. Moreover, other approaches for retrieval at L2 over land were investigated while Level 3 (L3) and Level 4 (L4) were initiated. In this paper, these improvements were assessed by inter comparisons of the current L2 (V620) against the previous version (V551) and new products (using neural networks referred to as SMOS-NN) and 1.3 (referred to as SMOS-L3). In addition, a global evaluation of different SMOS soil moisture (SM) products (SMOS-L2, SMOS-L3, and SMOS-NN) was performed comparing products with those of model simulations and other satellites. Finally, all products were evaluated against in situ measurements of soil moisture (SM). To achieve such a goal a set of metrics to evaluate different satellite products are suggested.
   The study demonstrated that the V620 shows a significant improvement (including those at L1 improving L2) with respect to the earlier version V551. Results also show that neural network based approaches can often yield excellent results over areas where other products are poor. Finally, global compa'rison indicates that SMOS behaves very well when compared to other sensors/approaches and gives consistent results over all surfaces from very dry (African Sahel, Arizona), to wet (tropical rain forests). RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) is still an issue even though detection has been greatly improved through the significant reduction of RFI sources in several areas of the world. When compared to other satellite products, the analysis shows that SMOS achieves its expected goals and is globally consistent over different eco climate regions from low to high latitudes and throughout the seasons.

AB The SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission provides surface soil moisture (SM) maps at a mean resolution of similar to 50 km. However, agricultural applications (irrigation, crop monitoring) and some hydrological applications (floods and modeling of small basins) require higher resolution SM information. In order to overcome this spatial mismatch, a disaggregation algorithm called Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DISPATCH) combines higher-resolution data from optical/thermal sensors with the SM retrieved from microwave sensors like SMOS, producing higher-resolution SM as the output. A DISPATCH-based processor has been implemented for the whole globe (emerged lands) in the Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees SMOS (CATDS), the French data processing center for SMOS Level 3 products. This new CATDS Level-4 Disaggregation processor (C4DIS) generates SM maps at 1 km resolution. This paper provides an overview of the C4DIS architecture, algorithms and output products. Differences with the original DISPATCH prototype are explained and major processing parameters are presented. The C4DIS SM product is compared against L3 and in situ SM data during a one year period over the Murrumbidgee catchment and the Yanco area (Australia), and during a four and a half year period over the Little Washita and the Walnut Gulch watersheds (USA). The four validation areas represent highly contrasting climate regions with different landscape properties. According to this analysis, the C4DIS SM product improves the spatio-temporal correlation with in situ measurements in the semi-arid regions with substantial SM spatial variability mainly driven by precipitation and irrigation. In sub-humid regions like the Little Washita watershed, the performance of the algorithm is poor except for summer, as result of the weak moisture-evaporation coupling. Disaggregated products do not succeed to have and additional benefit in the Walnut Gulch watershed, which is also semi-arid but with well-drained soils that are likely to cancel the spatial contrast needed by DISPATCH. Although further validation studies are still needed to better assess the performance of DISPATCH in a range of surface and atmospheric conditions, the new C4DIS product is expected to provide satisfying results over regions having medium to high SM spatial variability.

AB The multifractal fusion is a non-parametric technique that merges remotely-sensed maps of different ocean variables to produce higher quality remote sensing products. This method was first introduced to reduce the noise level in a map of a given ocean variable provided that a higher-quality map of a second ocean variable is available. In this work, we go one step further in both the theoretical justification and the application of the multifractal fusion. In the first part of the paper we explore if the quality of the derived maps can be improved by using a higher-dimensional tensor relating the gradient of one variable with that of the other. Higher dimension tensors require the introduction of appropriate integration schemes to avoid inducing long-range artifacts, something that is not completely solved yet. The results show that although higher-dimension tensors lead to an improvement in the spatial consistency of the derived maps (i.e., a higher quality of the associated singularity exponents), the comparison with in situ data still show significant reconstruction errors as compared to the simplified scalar approach. In the second part of the paper we have used the scalar approach to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of the current Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 3 sea surface salinity (SSS) maps produced at the Barcelona Expert Center (BEC). As such, new daily SMOS SSS global maps are generated at a 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees grid resolution. The quality of the resulting products has been assessed using in-situ comparison, singularity analysis and power density spectra. It is concluded that the multifractal fusion can be used to significantly increase the spatial and temporal resolution of the SSS maps. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We compared 10 established and 2 new satellite reflectance algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in a temperate reservoir in southwest Ohio using coincident hyperspectral aircraft imagery and dense coincident surface observations collected within 1 h of image acquisition to develop simple proxies for algal blooms in water bodies sensitive to algal blooms (especially toxic or harmful algal blooms (HABs)) and to facilitate portability between multispectral satellite imagers for regional algal bloom monitoring. All algorithms were compared with narrow band hyperspectral aircraft images. These images were subsequently upscaled spectrally and spatially to simulate 5 current and near future satellite imaging systems. Established and new Chl-a algorithms were then applied to the synthetic satellite images and compared to coincident surface observations of Chl-a collected from 44 sites within 1 h of aircraft acquisition of the imagery. We found several promising algorithm/satellite imager combinations for routine Chl-a estimation in smaller inland water bodies with operational and near-future satellite systems. The CI, MCI, FLH, NDCI, 2BDA and 3 BDA Chl-a algorithms worked well with CASI imagery. The NDCI, 2BDA, and 3BDA Chl-a algorithms worked well with simulated WorldView-2 and 3, Sentinel-2, and MERIS-like imagery. NDCI was the most widely applicable Chl-a algorithm with good performance for CASI, WorldView 2 and 3, Sentinel-2 and MERIS-like imagery and limited performance with MODIS imagery. A new fluorescence line height "greenness" algorithm yielded the best Chl-a estimates with simulated Landsat-8 imagery. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Radiative transfer models have long been used to characterize the foliar content at the leaf and canopy levels. However, they still do not apply well to close-range imaging spectroscopy, especially because directional effects are usually not taken into account. For this purpose, we introduce a physical approach to describe and simulate the variation in leaf reflectance observed at this scale. Two parameters are thus introduced to represent (1) specular reflection at the leaf surface and (2) local leaf orientation. The model, called COSINE (ClOse-range Spectral ImagiNg of lEaves), can be coupled with a directional-hemispherical reflectance model of leaf optical properties to relate the measured reflectance to the foliar content. In this study, we show that, when combining COSINE with the PROSPECT model, the overall PROCOSINE model allows for a robust submillimeter retrieval of foliar content based on numerical inversion and pseudo-bidirectional reflectance factor hyperspectral measurements.
   The relevance of the added parameters is first shown through a sensitivity analysis performed in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) ranges. PROCOSINE is then validated based on VNIR and SWIR hyperspectral images of various leaf species exhibiting different surface properties. Introducing these two parameters within the inversion allows us to obtain accurate maps of PROSPECT parameters, e.g., the chlorophyll content in the VNIR range, and the equivalent water thickness and leaf mass per area in the SWIR range. Through the estimation of light incident angle, the PROCOSINE inversion also provides information on leaf orientation, which is a critical parameter in vegetation remote sensing.

AB The Argentine hake Merluccius hubbsi is one of the main commercial resources of the Southwest Atlantic region, with a reported catch of 259,202 tons in 2014. Hake recruitment shows high interannual variability, yet the environmental and biological factors that influence reproduction are not fully understood. The increasing availability of ocean color data presents an opportunity to investigate a wide variety of fundamental topics including ocean primary productivity, climate change, and fisheries, among others. However, differences in the timing, length, and radiometer characteristics of the different missions result in a number of relatively short data records that are not suitable, individually, for the analysis of interdecadal changes. The combination of these datasets to produce longer time series of consistent data is essential for interpreting variability and trends in key parameters. We analyzed almost 5 years of high spatial resolution overlapping data from the SeaWiFS and MODIS Aqua sensors in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean to assess differences in chlorophyll concentration retrievals, estimate uncertainties, and develop corrections. Data from SeaWiFS (1997-2006) and corrected MODIS (2007-2015) were analyzed jointly as a >17-year time series of consistent and continuous chlorophyll concentration data, the longest record to date in the region. Trend analyses performed in the main spawning and nursery areas of M. hubbsi revealed significant increases in chlorophyll concentrations since 1997. The environmental factors likely influencing the observed changes and the potential implications for recruitment of M. hubbsi are discussed. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB We analyzed 4-years of Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) incidence angle normalized C-band backscatter, Next-Generation Radar (NEXRAD) precipitation and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop yield data over the contiguous United States (U.S.). Large negative anomalies in backscatter are evident over the U.S. during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons, coincident with two instances of severe drought. The backscatter anomalies were correlated with diminished growing season precipitation and with reduced crop yields reflecting where drought-induced impacts on above-ground biomass production occurred. During periods of acute drought, differences in diurnal backscatter were reduced and in some cases reversed reflecting diminished nocturnal leave rehydration. The results indicate that the C-band, VV-polarized ASCAT backscatter data is sensitive to interannual variability in agricultural productivity rather than soil moisture, and can offer an important geophysical monitoring tool capable of identifying and assessing drought-related vegetation responses independent of and complementary to satellite optical/near-infrared remote sensing data. This technique is flexible and adaptable, providing a capability to address region-specific needs. The twice-daily, weather independent and near-real time global monitoring capabilities of ASCAT and similar microwave instruments (e.g. RapidSCAT, Sentinel-1) can help improve drought preparedness and mitigation planning allowing improved water resource management for agriculture on the local as well as the state level.

AB Urbanization accelerated rapidly in China during the first decade of the 21st century, largely at the expense of agricultural lands. To improve available regional information related to the coupled dynamics between these two land use types, we fused data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and stable nighttime lights observations from DMSP/OLS instruments to map fractional urban cover at 250 m spatial resolution for cities in Eastern, Central, and Southern China where recent urban expansion has been rapid and pronounced. To accomplish this, we constructed Random Forest regression models to estimate sub-pixel urban percentage for 2001 and 2010 using high quality calibration information derived from Landsat data. Separate models were built for temperate and tropical regions and then evaluated for nine cities between 18,000 and 31,000 km(2) in area. Urban area estimated from MODIS compared favorably with Landsat-based results, with mean absolute errors of similar to 9-15%. Tests of different input feature sets showed that including data from downscaled MODIS 500 m bands and nighttime lights can improve estimates of urban land area compared to using MODIS 250 m features alone. Based on these results we produced wall-to-wall maps of urban land use in 2001 and 2010 for four MODIS tiles covering temperate and subtropical China, thereby demonstrating the utility of coarse spatial resolution data for mapping urban land use and loss of agricultural land at regional and larger scales.

Airborne LiDAR can detect small-scale disturbances, which are undetectable by conventional remote sensing. Here, our aim was to evaluate the similarity in community composition of tree assemblages after human disturbances in a tropical rainforest in northern Borneo using small-footprint airborne LiDAR. We derived 16 variables related to the height distribution and canopy characteristics from airborne LiDAR data. The similarity in community composition among plots was calculated using ordination analysis (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) based on the number of trees of each species. LiDAR-derived variables were significantly correlated with the similarity in community composition; the strongest correlation was with the canopy laser penetration rate down to 1-m height above ground (r(s) = 0.81, p < 0.001). The predictive model for similarity in community composition developed using the canopy laser penetration rate at 0-m height and the maximum height had R-adj(2) = 0.71 (p < 0.001). We applied this equation to the entire study area and compared the output with the human disturbance histories. A predictive map based on the equation suggested that the similarity in community composition changes in proportion to the degree of human disturbances. Our findings indicate that the similarity attributed to human disturbances in tropical forests can be predicted and monitored by means of airborne LiDAR. This approach could be combined with ground-based monitoring data to map the patterns of biodiversity in tropical rainforest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Accurate distribution maps are essential to understand further and control the fast expansion of the introduced saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) in the western U.S. Remote sensing imagery, due to its broad spatial and temporal coverage, is well-suited for this task. More specifically, images acquired during late fall and early winter are used for saltcedar identification as the plant's foliage turns a unique orange-yellow color (coloration) during this time of a year, which makes them easily distinguishable from other plant species. However, saltcedar coloration usually lasts for only several weeks, and the timing of this phenological event varies across space. Therefore, without prior knowledge of saltcedar phenology, it is often challenging to select the remote sensing image collected at the optimal time of the year to capture the distinctive spectral signature of the coloring saltcedar. Moreover, the timing of saltcedar coloration also varies within a single remote sensing scene making it inappropriate to use an entire scene as the mapping unit. In our study, we found that the timing of saltcedar peak coloration and leaf drop were linearly correlated with each other and we were able to model this relationship using the MODIS End of Season-Time (EoST) product and Landsat TM images. Guided by a per-pixel model estimation of saltcedar coloration date, we constructed composite Landsat images at two study sites along the Rio Grande River such that each pixel in the composite images was acquired during saltcedar peak coloration. Classification results showed that the phenology-informed composite image was better for saltcedar identification than the single scene image as it was able to capture the within-scene variations in saltcedar phenology. In addition, given our lack of training data for the model, the successful classification results obtained at the Middle Rio Grande River site also demonstrated the potential of our proposed method to be applied for large-scale saltcedar mapping.

AB Boreal forests exhibit strong seasonal dynamics in their reflectance spectra during the short, snow-free growing period. This short communication paper reports an analysis of the seasonality of boreal forest spectra from the end of snowmelt until the time of maximal leaf area. We apply a forest reflectance model (FRT) to estimate the seasonal contribution of understow vegetation to forest reflectance from a time series of three Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) Hyperion images acquired in May, June and July. The reflectance simulations are based on detailed seasonal series of leaf area index and understory spectra measurements carried out in ten stands at the Hyytiala Forestry Field Station in Finland. Our results show that the contribution of understory to boreal forest reflectance is high in the visible domain, but it drops at the red edge and stays relatively low and constant in near infrared (NIR). Throughout the growing season, the contribution of the understory remains approximately the same in the NIR domain, whereas larger changes can be observed in the visible domain. (C) 2015 The Authors.

AB The mapping of water bodies at global scale has been undertaken primarily using multi-spectral optical Earth Observation data. Limitations of optical data associated with non-uniform and temporally variable spectral signatures suggested investigating alternative approaches towards a more consistent and reliable detection of water bodies. Multi-year (2005-2012) observations of SAR backscattered intensities at moderate resolution from the Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) instrument were used in this study to generate an indicator of open permanent water bodies (SAR-WBI) for the year 2010 time frame and for all land surfaces excluding Antarctica and the Greenland ice sheet A first map of potential water bodies with a spatial resolution of 150 m was obtained with a global detection algorithm based on a set of thresholds applied to multi-temporal metrics of the SAR backscatter (temporal variability, TV, and minimum backscatter, MB). Local refinements were then used to reduce systematic commission and omission errors (4.6% of the total area mapped) due to the similarity of TV and MB over open water bodies and other land surface types primarily in cold and arid environments. The refinement rules are here explained by means of a detailed signature analysis of the SAR backscatter in such environments. The accuracy of the SAR-WBI was 80% when compared against 2078 manually interpreted footprints with a size of 150 x 150 m(2). Omission errors were primarily observed along coast- and shorelines whereas commission errors were associated with (i) ephemeral water bodies, (ii) seasonally inundated areas, and (iii) an incorrect choice of the local refinement.

AB Retrospective identification of fire severity can improve our understanding of fire behaviour and ecological responses. However, burnt area records for many ecosystems are non-existent or incomplete, and those that are documented rarely include fire severity data. Retrospective analysis using satellite remote sensing data captured over extended periods can provide better estimates of fire history. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the Landsat differenced normalised burn ratio (dNBR) and field measured geometrically structured composite burn index (GeoCBI) for retrospective analysis of fire severity over a 23 year period in sclerophyll woodland and heath ecosystems. Further, we assessed for reduced dNBR fire severity classification accuracies associated with vegetation regrowth at increasing time between ignition and image capture. This was achieved by assessing four Landsat images captured at increasing time since ignition of the most recent burnt area. We found significant linear GeoCBI-dNBR relationships (R-2 = 0.81 and 0.71) for data collected across ecosystems and for Eucalyptus racemosa ecosystems, respectively. Non-significant and weak linear relationships were observed for heath and Melaleuca quinquenervia ecosystems, suggesting that GeoCBI-dNBR was not appropriate for fire severity classification in specific ecosystems. Therefore, retrospective fire severity was classified across ecosystems. Landsat images captured within similar to 30 days after fire events were minimally affected by post burn vegetation regrowth.

AB We evaluated the performance of several published algorithms designed to detect Karenia brevis blooms on the West Florida Shelf using satellite imagery. Algorithms were tested using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images and historical ground-truth observations collected from August 2002 to December 2011. A total of 2323 phytoplankton cell count samples collected by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) matched valid ocean color satellite observations over this period. Techniques were tested using the F-measure (FM) statistic. FM evaluates the proportion of image pixels that matches or misclassifies ground-based K. brevis observations. Several ocean color data products, such as normalized Fluorescence Line Height (nFLH), were also tested independently or combined to evaluate their effectiveness to detect K. brevis blooms. Techniques were optimized by altering their specific thresholds until the maximum FM was obtained. The historical techniques with the best performance were the Red Band Difference (RBD) and the R-rs-nFLH technique. This last method (R-rs-nFLH) is a combination of two standard ocean color data products: nFLH (>0.033 mW cm(-2) mu m(-1) sr(-1) ) and the remote sensing reflectance at 555 nm (R(rs)555 <0.007 sr(-1)). Both techniques resulted in an FM of 0.62 and less than 3% false positives. The performance of most of the techniques improved significantly after optimization (the average FM increased from 0.47 to 0.57). The addition of a nFLH criterion improved the performance of most methods. We provide a list of recommendations on how to best apply the various techniques. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Secchi disk depth (ZsD) is a measure of water transparency, whose interpretation has wide applications from diver visibility to studies of climate change. This transparency has been explained in the past 60 + years with the underwater visibility theory, the branch of the general visibility theory for visual ranging in water. However, through a thorough review of the physical processes involved in visual ranging in water, we show that this theory may not exactly represent the sighting of a Secchi disk by a human eye. Further, we update the Law of Contrast Reduction, a key concept in visibility theory, and develop a new theoretical model to interpret ZsD. Unlike the classical model that relies strongly on the beam attenuation coefficient, the new model relies only on the diffuse attenuation coefficient at a wavelength corresponding to the maximum transparency for such interpretations. This model is subsequently validated using a large (N = 338) dataset of independent measurements covering oceanic, coastal, and lake waters, with results showing excellent agreement (similar to 18% average absolute difference, R-2 = 0.96) between measured and theoretically predicted ZsD ranging from <1 m to >30 m without regional tuning of any model parameters. This study provides a more generalized view of visual ranging, and the mechanistic model is expected to significantly improve the current capacity in monitoring water transparency of the global aquatic environments via satellite remote sensing.

AB In African savanna, spatio-temporal variability in moisture availability, fire regime and land transformation related to exploitative land uses are the main drivers of changing vegetation greenness patterns. Deconstructing the role of these drivers at local scale is critical for managing the impact of projected climate and land use changes on savanna ecosystems. Focusing on an area encompassing Africa's largest terrestrial protected area, this study utilized time-series MODIS NDVI (2000-2014) and employed a robust trend analysis technique to detect significant temporal trend in key greenness metrics including overall greenness, peak and timing of the peak of annual greenness and examined how spatial variability in vegetation morphology and land use impacted the distribution of these greenness parameters. To access causation of change, we linked detected greenness trends to precipitation trends derived from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM), annual burnt area extent and fire frequency and compared multi-temporal imagery in Google Earth. Results show that distribution of both overall and peak annual greenness was vegetation morphology specific as with decreasing woody cover the proportion of pixels showing negative overall and peak annual greenness trend increased consistently. Majority of the area with significant trend in the timing of the peak of annual greenness showed late greenup, implying changing phenological patterns. Trend analysis of TRMM derived mean annual precipitation showed no significant change in precipitation over the study period. At local scale, increase in overall and peak annual greenness was associated with woody plant encroachment due to increased moisture availability and reduced fire frequency due to construction of fire breaks in areas under farm/ranch land use. In protected areas, negative overall and peak annual greenness was driven by unmanaged high intensity mega fire events and outside due to anthropogenic land clearing for pastoral agriculture. These results further our understanding of the complex interaction of multiple ecological factors and resultant spatial variability in savanna inter-annual vegetation greenness patterns and are useful for implementing local scale management strategies.

AB In recent years, LiDAR technology has provided accurate forest aboveground biomass (AGB) maps in several forest ecosystems, including tropical forests. However, its ability to accurately map forest AGB changes in high-biomass tropical forests has seldom been investigated. Here, we assess the ability of repeated LiDAR acquisitions to map AGB stocks and changes in an old-growth Neotropical forest of French Guiana. Using two similar aerial small-footprint LiDAR campaigns over a four year interval, spanning ca. 20 km(2), and concomitant ground sampling, we constructed a model relating median canopy height and AGB at a 0.25-ha and 1-ha resolution. This model had an error of 14% at a 1-ha resolution (RSE = 54.7 Mg ha(-1)) and of 23% at a 0.25-ha resolution (RSE = 865 Mg ha(-1)). This uncertainty is comparable with values previously reported in other tropical forests and confirms that aerial LiDAR is an efficient technology for AGB mapping in high-biomass tropical forests. Our map predicts a mean AGB of 340 Mg ha-1 within the landscape. We also created an AGB change map, and compared it with ground-based AGB change estimates. The correlation was weak but significant only at the 0.25-ha resolution. One interpretation is that large natural tree-fall gaps that drive AGB changes in a naturally regenerating forest can be picked up at fine spatial scale but are veiled at coarser spatial resolution. Overall, both field-based and LiDAR-based estimates did not reveal a detectable increase in AGB stock over the study period, a trend observed in almost all forest types of our study area. Small footprint LiDAR is a powerful tool to dissect the fine-scale variability of AGB and to detect the main ecological controls underpinning forest biomass variability both in space and time.

AB The Amazon rainforest is a critical hotspot for bio-diversity, and plays an essential role in global carbon, water and energy fluxes and the earth's climate. Our ability to project the role of vegetation carbon feedbacks on future climate critically depends upon our understanding of this tropical ecosystem, its tolerance to climate extremes and tipping points of ecosystem collapse. Satellite remote sensing is the only practical approach to obtain observational evidence of trends and changes across large regions of the Amazon forest; however, inferring these trends in the presence of high cloud cover fraction and aerosol concentrations has led to widely varying conclusions. Our study provides a simple and direct statistical analysis of a measurable change in daily and composite surface reflectance obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based on the noise level of data and the number of available observations. Depending on time frame and data product chosen for analysis, changes in leaf area need to exceed up to 2 units leaf area per unit ground area (expressed as m(2) m(-2)) across much of the basin before these changes can be detected at a 95% confidence level with conventional approaches, roughly corresponding to a change in NDVI and EVI of about 25%. A potential way forward may be provided by advanced multi-angular techniques, such as the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithm (MAIAC), which allowed detection of changes of about 0.6-0.8 units in leaf area (2-6% change in NDVI) at the same confidence level. In our analysis, the use of the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) did not improve accuracy of detectable change in leaf area but added a complicating sensitivity to the bidirectional reflectance, or view geometry effects.

AB Wildfires can pose direct and indirect threats to public health via fire and smoke, respectively. Evacuations are used to manage both types of threat given situational information about fires and their behaviour. However, there has been limited documented use of objective remote sensing data to inform the decision-making process. We conduct a retrospective assessment of 41 smoke-related evacuations in Canada between 2000 and 2007 using smoke and cloud data from the Terra MODIS. Daily mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements were used to represent smoke levels in the area surrounding each evacuation site. Time series of these data were plotted for the four days prior to evacuation, the evacuation date, and the four days following the evacuation. Daily ADD values were scaled using the daily cloud mask to crudely account for the fact that heavy aerosol can be classified as cloud. Time series plots and the percentage differences between pre- and post-evacuation AOD were used to contextualize each evacuation. Out of 41 cases, approximately half met each of the criteria used to assess public health protection: (1) post-evacuation AOD values over the risk threshold for sensitive populations; (2) peak AOD exposures occurring post-evacuation; and (3) mean AOD higher post-evacuation than pre-evacuation. Some evacuations did not meet any of these criteria. Although evacuation decisions would never be made in the absence of situational intelligence, we conclude that systematic use of objective and readily available remote sensing data can help to retrospectively evaluate smoke-related evacuations, and may be useful for prospective, real-time application with further development.

AB In this paper we demonstrate a method for estimating the leaf area density (LAD) distribution of individual trees using high-resolution airborne LiDAR. This method calculates the LAD distribution from the contact frequency between the laser beams and leaves by tracing the laser beam paths. Multiple returns were used to capture the foliage distribution in the inner part of the crown. Each laser beam is traced from a location of the last return to the location of the first or intermediate return that is recorded immediately before the last return. We verified the estimation accuracy of the LAD distribution using terrestrial LiDAR data from single trees (Zelkova serrata and Cinnamomum camphora). The appropriate voxel size for representing the LAD distribution from the airborne LiDAR data was determined to be 1 m x 1 m x 0.5 m. The accuracy of the estimated LAD distribution for this voxel size was then examined while considering the number of airborne incident laser beams on the voxel (N) and the return type used. When only the first and single returns were used, the LAD was overestimated even for the voxels with large N. LAD was estimated as zero for most voxels with small N, although LAD was significantly overestimated for several voxels. We found that using the last and intermediate returns improved the LAD estimation accuracy even if N was the same. The mean LAD estimation error was 0.25-03 m(2)/m(3) for both species. Assigning different weights to the first and intermediate returns improved the accuracy slightly. Estimation error clearly corresponded to N, and N of 8-11 could be a criterion for an accurate LAD estimation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a key instrument flying aboard Suomi NPP satellite. It is a follow on mission for NOM series AVHRR and NASA MODIS. The radiometric stability and accuracy of VIIRS are critical to make its data useful for weather and climate applications. This study is focused on analyzing VIIRS radiometric performance using well established calibration sites and through the inter-comparison with other satellite instruments such as AQUA MODIS and Landsat 8 OLI The paper analyzes stability of VIIRS reflective solar bands over more than two years by using sites such as Libya 4, Sudan 1 and Dome C. VIIRS absolute radiometric accuracy is quantified using AQUA MODIS over the above mentioned sites. For VIIRS band M11 (2.1 mu m), since there is no matching MODIS band pair, this study uses matching SWIR band from Landsat 8 OLI as a reference to quantify the absolute calibration accuracy of M11. The study shows that VIIRS moderate resolution reflective solar bands are stable with better than 0.5% for most of the bands with uncertainty on the order of 1%. After accounting the spectral differences, the absolute radiometric bias estimated through VIIRS and MODIS intercalibration is within 2% for bands M1-5 and M10 and about 3% for bands M7-8. Similarly, M11 bias estimated using VIIRS and OLI inter-comparison is 5.4%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable for studying the energy and water vapor exchange at the biosphere-atmosphere interface. In an effort to better quantify the spatial variability and overall representativeness of single-point LST measurements being recorded at NOAA's Climate Reference Network (CRN) sites and to improve the accuracy of satellite LST measurements, airborne flight campaigns were conducted over a CRN site in Crossville, Tennessee, USA during 2010 to 2011. Multiple measurements of LST were made using infrared temperature sensors at micrometeorological tower sites and onboard an instrumented Piper Navajo airborne research aircraft. In addition to this, coincident LST products from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments (Collection 5), onboard NASA Terra and Aqua Earth Observing System satellites were used. In this paper the comparison of LST measurements made from multiple platforms are presented. Our study showed that the temporal and spatial variability of surface temperature as indicated by the standard deviation of the brightness temperature (T-b) during the flight periods were <1.7 degrees C. Aircraft and tower-based T-b during the flight periods agreed well with a root mean square error (RMSE) of <1.3 degrees C. The daytime MODIS LST was lower than the tower and aircraft-based LST, but higher than the daytime near surface air temperature (T-a). MODIS LST showed a positive and lower bias with the nighttime tower-based LST, but with slightly higher RMSE than the daytime dataset The MODIS LST showed better correlation with the tower-based LST than T-a during clear sky conditions due to the complex relationship between air and surface temperature. Including both day and nighttime data the MODIS LST showed a bias of -056 degrees C, RMSE of 2.84 degrees C, and standard deviations of the difference of 2.79 degrees C when compared to the mean tower-based LST at the site. Tower-based 11 explained 98% of the variance in LST during nighttime conditions with a bias of similar to 0.8 degrees C and RMSE of 0.86 degrees C. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery was used to reconstruct the change in limnological conditions adjacent to an Arctic ice shelf by examining the backscatter values of coastal ice in mid-winter scenes. High SAR backscatter values (>-6 dB) suggest that an ice-dammed lake was present adjacent to the south coast of Petersen Bay from 1992 until 2005. Following a large calving event of the adjacent Petersen Ice Shelf (-8.07 km(2)) in August 2005, the lake drained through a region where the ice shelf had separated from the coastline. This loss of freshwater and replacement of lake ice with sea ice along the southern coast of Petersen Bay were confirmed from analyses of ice core samples and conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles. The exception to this pattern was one distinct area where terrestrial streams entered the edge of Petersen Bay and freshwater continued to collect from 2006 to 2008. However, this ephemeral area of freshwater has not reformed since 2009 due to the persistence of open water events in Petersen Bay (observed in optical satellite imagery), which likely facilitated mixing of freshwater with sea water. Based on the continued break-ups of Petersen Ice Shelf and the frequency of open water events, it is unlikely that this ice-dammed lake will reform. The results of this study underscore the utility of SAR for reconstructing past hydrographic conditions in the water column below. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we present novel automated field spectroscopy systems for collecting unattended, continuous and long-term measurements of plant canopies and, more in general, of Earth's ecosystems. These systems simultaneously collect high and ultra-high resolution spectra in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR) domain employing two spectrometers: i) the first covers the spectral range 400-1000 nm with a 1.0 nm spectral resolution; ii) the second provides a sub-nanometer spectral resolution within the 700-800 nm spectral range. The data collected by the first spectrometer allow retrieval of VNIR reflectance, while the higher spectral resolution data from the second device permit estimation of vegetation Sun-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) in the O-2-A band. The instruments are constructed by assembling commercial and on-the-shelf optoelectronic devices to facilitate reproduction of the instrument for promoting measurements over different ecosystems. The instrument's optical design, data collection and processing, laboratory and in-field calibration methods are reported and discussed. The high spectral resolution and the rigorous calibration methods enable accurate estimation of SIF in physical units by exploiting almost the same retrieval concept as that of the European Space Agency FLuorescence EXplorer mission. The instruments have been operated in several field campaigns with the aim to show: i) the possibility of continuous and seasonal monitoring of plant growth and activity of an agricultural crop; and ii) the diverse and specific daily course patterns of different types of canopy. The datasets of canopy reflectance, vegetation indices and SIF collected are shown and discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present the development of a global burned area (BA) algorithm based on MERIS imagery along with the assessment of the global BA results for three years (2006-2008). This work was developed within the Fire Disturbance project under the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative programme, which aimed to generate long-term BA information for climate models. Our algorithm combined temporal series of MERIS reflectances with thermal information from MODIS HS (hotspot) product. The algorithm included two-steps. Firstly, cumulative distribution functions were computed to discriminate the most clearly burned pixels using regionally-oriented near infrared reflectance thresholds. Secondly, a contextual criterion improved the spatial detection of the burned patches from the seed pixels. BA estimates for the three target years range from 3.6 to 3.8 million km(2). Results were validated from a statistically designed sample of fire perimeters generated from Landsat multi-temporal imagery. Intercomparison with existing BA products was also carried out. Results from global validation datasets provided an average overall accuracy higher than 0.95. The accuracy of the BA category was lower than the accuracy of the unburned one. Within the former, average omission and commission errors were lower for areas where the proportion of burned area was higher (for pixel-based error matrices, commission error (CE) was 0.52 and omission error (OE) was 0.51), than for those areas with very low BA proportion (CE = 0.60 and OE = 0.74). In terms of total BA estimation, errors were generally well balanced, with a tendency towards underestimation.(34%). Relevant impact of temporal reporting accuracy was found for these validation datasets. Intercomparison with other existing BA datasets pointed out similar spatial and temporal trends, with high correlation with GFED v4 BA estimations for the three years (r(2) > 0.974).

AB Long-term and large-scale remotely sensed and reanalysis soil moisture products of the Tibetan Plateau are very important for understanding the land-atmosphere interactions in this area and their impacts on the weather and climate in the Asian continent However, it is of great importance to assess the reliability of these products before using them. In the study, in-situ soil moisture measurements from three networks which represent different climatic and vegetation conditions over the Tibetan Plateau are used to evaluate the skill of seven remotely sensed soil moisture products and one reanalysis soil moisture product in the period of 2002-2012. The remotely sensed soil moisture products include three widely used products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E): the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) soil moisture product, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil moisture product, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) soil moisture product; the remaining products are the JAXA AMSR2 soil moisture product, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) soil moisture product, the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture product, and the Essential Climate Variable (ECV) soil moisture product which is a new merged product using both active and passive soil moisture products. The reanalysis product is the latest ERA-Interim product produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The results show that all these products can generally capture the soil moisture dynamics well except for the NASA product which significantly underestimates the soil moisture and also lacks temporal dynamics. The JAXA AMSR-E and AMSR2 products underestimate the ground measurements at most of the time, whereas the LPRM product gives much larger seasonal amplitude than the in-situ observations with a large positive bias. It seems that the SMOS observations are severely affected by the well-known radio-frequency interference (RFI) which leads to a big noise and bias in the SMOS product. The ASCAT product overestimates the ground measurements, but it correlates with in-situ soil moisture very well and is also less influenced by vegetation cover. In general, the ECV and ERA products outperform other products. Though the ECV product underestimates the soil moisture, it shows the best correlation with ground measurements and captures the variation of in-situ soil moisture very well while the ERA product is closest to the absolute values of soil moisture observations. Overall, most of the products give reasonable results in terms of correlation in sparsely vegetated areas. We expect that the validation results can be used as a feedback to the algorithm developers to further enhance the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals over the Tibetan Plateau.

AB Remote sensing instruments are key players to map land surface temperature (LST) at large temporal and spatial scales. In this paper, we present how we combine passive microwave and thermal infrared data to estimate LST during summer snow-free periods over northern high latitudes. The methodology is based on the SSM/I-SSMIS 37 GHz measurements at both vertical and horizontal polarizations on a 25 km x 25 km grid size. LST is retrieved from brightness temperatures introducing an empirical linear relationship between emissivities at both polarizations as described in Royer and Poirier (2010). This relationship is calibrated at pixel scale, using cloud-free independent LST data from MODIS instruments. The SSM/I-SSMIS and MODIS data are synchronized by fitting a diurnal cycle model built on skin temperature reanalysis provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The resulting temperature dataset is provided at 25 km scale and at an hourly time step during the ten-year analysis period (2000-2011). This new product was locally evaluated at five experimental sites of the EU-PAGE21 project against air temperature measurements and meteorological model reanalysis, and compared to the MODIS LST product at both local and circumpolar scale. The results giving a mean RMSE of the order of 2.2 K demonstrate the usefulness of the microwave product, which is unaffected by clouds as opposed to thermal infrared products and offers a better resolution compared to model reanalysis.

AB The GHG-CCI project is one of several projects of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI). The goal of the CCI is to generate and deliver data sets of various satellite-derived Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) in line with GCOS (Global Climate Observing System) requirements. The "ECV Greenhouse Gases" (ECV GHG) is the global distribution of important climate relevant gases - atmospheric CO2 and CH4 - with a quality sufficient to obtain information on regional CO2 and CH4 sources and sinks. Two satellite instruments deliver the main input data for GHG-CCI: SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT and TANSO-FTS/GOSAT. The first order priority goal of GHG-CCI is the further development of retrieval algorithms for near-surface-sensitive column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 and CH4, denoted XCO2 and XCH4, to meet the demanding user requirements. GHG-CCI focuses on four core data products: XCO2 from SCIAMACHY and TANSO and XCH4 from the same two sensors. For each of the four core data products at least two candidate retrieval algorithms have been independently further developed and the corresponding data products have been quality-assessed and inter-compared. This activity is referred to as "Round Robin" (RR) activity within the CCI. The main goal of the RR was to identify for each of the four core products which algorithms should be used to generate the Climate Research Data Package (CRDP). The CRDP will essentially be the first version of the ECV GHG. This manuscript gives an overview of the GHG-CCI RR and related activities. This comprises the establishment of the user requirements, the improvement of the candidate retrieval algorithms and comparisons with ground-based observations and models. The manuscript summarizes the final RR algorithm selection decision and its justification. Comparison with ground-based Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) data indicates that the "breakthrough" single measurement precision requirement has been met for SCIAMACHY and TANSO XCO2 (<3 ppm) and TANSO XCH4 (<17 ppb). The achieved relative accuracy for XCH4 is 3-15 ppb for SCIAMACHY and 2-8 ppb for TANSO depending on algorithm and time period. Meeting the 0.5 ppm systematic error requirement for XCO2 remains a challenge: approximately 1 ppm has been achieved at the validation sites but also larger differences have been found in regions remote from TCCON. More research is needed to identify the causes for the observed differences. In this context GHG-CCI suggests taking advantage of the ensemble of existing data products, for example, via the EnseMble Median Algorithm (EMMA). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Estimating the thermal information in the subsurface and deeper ocean from satellite measurements over large basin-wide scale is important but also challenging. This paper proposes a support vector machine (SVM) method to estimate subsurface temperature anomaly (STA) in the Indian Ocean from a suite of satellite remote sensing measurements including sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA), sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), and sea surface salinity anomaly (SSSA). The SVM estimation of STA features the inclusion of in-situ Argo STA data for training and testing. SVM, one of the most popular machine learning methods, can well estimate the STA in the upper 1000 m of the Indian Ocean from satellite measurements of sea surface parameters (SSTA, SSHA and SSSA as input attributes for SVM). The results, based on the common SVM application of Support Vector Regression (SVR), were validated for accuracy and reliability using the Argo STA data Both MSE and r(2) for performance measures are improved after including SSSA for SVR (MSE decreased by 12% and r(2) increased by 11% on average). The results showed that SSSA, in addition to SSTA and SSHA, is a useful parameter that can help detect and describe the deeper ocean thermal structure, as well as improve the STA estimation accuracy. Moreover, our method can provide a useful technique for studying subsurface and deeper ocean thermal variability which has played an important role in recent global surface warming hiatus since 1998, from satellite measurements in large basin-wide scale.

AB Identification of phytoplankton functional groups is key to understanding marine biogeochemical cycles. For more accurate understanding of phytoplankton community structure and its implications for ocean color remote sensing applications, we investigated seasonal changes in phytoplankton pigments with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), hyperspectral absorption coefficients of detritus (a(d)(lambda)), phytoplankton (a(ph)(lambda)), and colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)(lambda)), and hyperspectral a(ph)(X) derived from remote sensing reflectance (a(ph_Rrs-derived)(lambda)) in the coastal waters of Funka Bay from 2010 to 2012. Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations measured by HPLC ranged from 029 to 8.6 mg m(-3). Phytoplankton community compositions, as estimated by chemotaxonomic analysis (CHEMTAX) based on HPLC phytoplanIcton pigments, showed a seasonal succession of diatoms, chlorophyll b-containing phytoplankton (chlorophytes and prasinophytes), and cyanobacteria. Additonally, to identify the dominant type of phytoplankton with an alternative technique to CHEMTAX analysis, we employed a derivative spectroscopy/similarity index (SI) approach for a(ph)(X) as an optical detection technique for discriminating between different types of phytoplankton. In particular for diatom-dominated stations, SI values relative to the second derivative spectra of a(ph)(lambda) of diatom cultures, isolated from our study region, were significantly higher than those for chlorophyll b-containing phytoplankton- and cyanobacteriadominated stations. Furthermore, we found a strong relationship between the SI values calculated from the second derivative spectra and the composition of diatoms as estimated by CHEMTAX. These results suggest that the two different methods validated each other's performance and precision in estimating relative diatom abundance from bulk samples and that it is possible to optically discriminate the dominance of diatoms using derivative spectra of a(ph)(lambda). We extended this combination approach to hyperspectral a(ph_Rrs_derived)(lambda), using a quasi-analytical algorithm within 400-546 nm range. We found a significant correlation between SI values obtained from the second derivative spectra of a(ph_Rrs-derived)(lambda)/a(ph_Rrs-derived)(443) and the composition of diatoms derived by CHEMTAX, but it was not as high as for a(ph)(lambda) measured by filter-pad analysis. These results indicate that using hyperspectral optical data of a(ph)(lambda) and R-rs(lambda) with derivative spectroscopy is potentially a promising approach to identify seasonal variability in the composition of diatoms in coastal waters. Furthermore, a hyperspectral approach in combination with CHEMTAX analysis as a reference for phytoplankton community structure has proven useful in improving our understanding of phytoplankton community structure in the coastal waters of Funka Bay.

AB Periodically inundated wetlands with high short-term surface variation require special approaches to assess their composition and long-term change. To circumvent high uncertainty in single-date analyses of such areas, we propose to characterize them as dynamic cover types (DCTs), or sequences of wetland states and transitions informed by physically and ecologically plausible surface processes. This study delineated DCTs for one 2007-2008 flood cycle at Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater wetland in China, using spatial and temporal orientation modes of extended principal components analysis (EPCA) and supervised object-based classification of multi-spectral and radar image series. Classification accuracy was compared among three sets of attributes selected by machine-learning optimization from object-level mean and standard deviations of: 1) image time series alone; 2) the most informative EPCA outputs alone and 3) image time series and EPCA results together. Classification uncertainty was additionally assessed as low values of object's maximum class membership (<0.5). The highest accuracy was achieved with a larger set of 33 attributes selected from combined time series and EPCA results (overall accuracy 95.0%, kappa 0.94); however, accuracies with smaller sets of variables from input image series or EPCA results alone were comparably high (93.1% and 94.7%, respectively). All three selected attribute sets included standard deviations of image and/or EPCA values, suggesting the utility of object texture in dynamic class discrimination. The highest classification uncertainty was observed primarily along the mapped class boundaries, in some cases indicating minor change trajectories for which prior reference data were not available. Results indicate that DCTs provide a reasonable classification framework for complex and variable Poyang Lake wetlands that can be facilitated by EPCA transformation of complementary remote sensing time series. Future work should test this approach over multiple change cycles and assess sensitivity of results to temporal frequency of input image series, alternative variable selection algorithms and other remote sensors.

AB The Radarsat-1 Antarctic Mapping Project (RAMP) compiled a mosaic of Antarctica and the adjacent ocean zone from more than 3000 high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired in September and October 1997. The mosaic with a pixel size of 100 m was used to determine iceberg size distributions around Antarctica, combining an automated detection with a visual control of all icebergs larger than 5 km(2) and correction of recognized false detections. For icebergs below 5 km(2) in size, the numbers of false detections and accuracies of size retrievals were analyzed for three test sites. Nearly 7000 icebergs with horizontal areas between 0.3 and 4717.7 km(2) were identified in a near-coastal zone of varying width between 20 and 300 km. The spatial distributions of icebergs around Antarctica were calculated for zonal segments of 20 degrees angular width and related to the types of the calving fronts in the respective section. Results reveal that regional variations of the size distributions cannot be neglected. The highest ice mass accumulations were found at positions of giant icebergs (>18.5 km) but also in front of ice shelves from which larger numbers of smaller icebergs calve almost continuously. Although the coastal oceanic zone covered by RAMP is too narrow compared to the spatial coverage needed for oceanographic research, this study nevertheless demonstrates the usefulness of SAR images for iceberg research and the need for repeated data acquisitions extending ocean-wards over distances of 500 km and more from the coast to monitor iceberg melt and disintegration and the related freshwater input into the ocean.

AB Vegetation captures carbon from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, the rate of which varies across space, through time and is determined by both physical and biological factors. Methods for estimating photosynthesis (A) vary in their complexity and in which driving processes they capture. Whilst the effect of diffuse shortwave irradiance on A is well understood, few models have explicitly incorporated the diffuse effect into estimates of A. Here we present the DIFFUSE model, a simple, generic, diffuse-light-based method for estimating A at the monthly time scale. This model is based on the assumption that, at the monthly time scale, the majority of variability in A can be explained by the variability in total and diffuse irradiance and in the fraction of shortwave irradiance absorbed by foliage (f). Comparison of model estimates to eddy flux tower-derived monthly A showed that the majority (83%) of variability in observed A could be explained by the DIFFUSE model. The diffuse fraction contributed 5 to 10% of the model's accuracy across many of Australia's coastal regions, but contributed up to 50% in the monsoonal north. Various aspects of the DIFFUSE model were tested including its performance relative to an example of the more commonly used "stress-scalar" type of photosynthesis model. In all tests, the DIFFUSE model performed at least as well as more complex alternative models, and often outperformed them. The strengths of DIFFUSE are its physical basis, its simplicity and transparency, and its minimalist data requirements all of which are expected to make it useful to a wide variety of contexts and applications.

AB The spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) with persistent scatterer (PS) is utilized to retrieve the spatial characteristics of the largest coseismic landslide Daguangbao, induced by the Ms 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan Province, China. The available twenty interferometric pairs with good coherence selected from the ALOS/PALSAR imagery data covering the Longmen Shan mountainous area are used in the study. We have constructed a natural geodetic observation network with numerous scattered bare rocks emerging after the earthquake and coseismic landslide events, which are effectively recognized as the radar persistent scattering objects. The spatial connections between adjacent PS are established to form observation baselines with differential parameters related to topography and deformation, which are determined by the least squares method from time-series interferometric phase analysis. The post-seismic topographic change relative to the pre-seismic over the landslide area is spatially mapped from the PS network adjustment solution. The quantitative estimation of local elevation change, mass sliding volume and deposit thickness associated with the landslide is conducted. The spatial pattern of mass movement suggests that the giant landslide is characterized by a major sliding length of 4350 m along the NE-SW directions with an extension width of 3400 m along the Huangdongzi gully, and a peak height change of 535 m in the vertical direction. The affected area of landslide mass movement reaches 7.2 km(2) with the volume up to 1.28 billion m(3). The study also demonstrates the potential of persistent scatterer InSAR technique as an alternative to allow the quantitative measurement of mass wasting volume associated with earthquake-induced giant landslides.

AB Land surface albedo is an essential climate variable controlling the planetary radiative energy budget, yet it is still among the main uncertainties of the radiation budget in the current climate modeling. To date, albedo satellite products have not been linked to extensive forest inventory data sets due to the lack of ground reference data. Here, we used comprehensive and detailed maps of forest inventory variables to couple forest structure and MODIS albedo products for both winter and summer conditions. We investigated how the relationships between forest variables and albedo change seasonally and along latitudinal gradients in the forest biomes of Finland between 60 degrees and 70 degrees N. We observed an increase in forest albedo with increasing latitude in winter but not in summer. Also, relationships between forest variables and the black-sky albedo or directional-hemispherical reflectance (DHR) at different latitudes were tighter in winter than in summer, especially for forest biomass. Summer albedo was only weakly correlated with the traditional inventory variables. Our findings suggest that the relationships between forest variables and DHR depend on latitude.

AB The temporal depth and spatial breadth of observations from platforms such as Landsat provide unique perspective on ecosystem dynamics, but the integration of these observations into formal decision support will rely upon improved uncertainty accounting. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations offer a practical, empirical method of accounting for potential map errors in broader ecosystem assessments. However, unless steps are taken across simulations to vary the probability density functions (PDFs) that control simulated map error, the large number of map units to which those PDFs are applied may cause convergence of mean simulated conditions and an artificial reduction of MC estimates of uncertainty. For MC simulation of errors in categorical maps, we introduce a technique we call "PDF weaving" which both: 1) allows variation of PDFs across simulations; and, 2) explicitly aligns the resulting range of simulated populations with estimates and uncertainties identified by traditional monitoring methods such as design-based inventories. This approach is based on solving systems of linear equations and inequalities for each simulation. Each system incorporates linear constraints related to the unchanging distribution of area among classes in the original map (akin to the fixed longitudinal "warp" on a loom) with variable linear constraints related to the class distribution to be simulated in any one iteration (analogous to the perpendicular, variable fibers of the "weft"). Additional constraints specify how many map units to treat as "correct" based on validation exercises at the map unit level. Solution of these systems provides PDFs which will simulate error at both the map unit level and the population level in a way that is consistent with validation exercises and available population-level estimates. We illustrated this approach in an assessment of the effects of wildfire and harvest on carbon storage over 20 years on a forested landscape in the western United States (US). This assessment utilized the Forest Carbon Management Framework (ForCaMF) approach, which is being implemented by the US National Forest System (NFS). Results showed that simulating map error through the use of dynamic PDFs can contribute significant, realistic uncertainty in a Monte Carlo analysis, but that impacts of fire and harvest on carbon storage may nevertheless be dearly identified and differentiated using remotely sensed maps of vegetation and disturbance.

AB Live fuel moisture content (LFMC), the ratio of water mass to dry mass contained in live plant material, is an important fuel property for determining fire danger and for modeling fire behavior. Remote sensing estimation of LFMC often relies on an assumption of changing water and stable dry mass over time. Fundamental understanding of seasonal variation in plant water and dry mass is needed to explain the spectral expression of LFMC changes over time. We conducted a five-month experiment to continuously measure field LFMC samples, biochemical components of dry matter, and leaf spectroscopic data for two species common in the western U.S., lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Loudon) and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentate Nutt). Our results showed that new lodgepole pine needles initially had higher LFMC and a smaller proportion of dry mass, but differences between new and old needles converged as the new needles matured. New needle dry mass had strong temporal trends, and dry mass explained more variation in LFMC than water in both new and old needles. Sagebrush leaves exhibited decreasing trends in LFMC, but water and dry mass comparably contributed to LFMC seasonal variation. Spectroscopic analysis using partial least squares regression (PLSR) showed good modeling accuracy for LFMC temporal variation in new needles (R-2 = 0.94, RMSE = 5.84%), old needles (R-2 = 0.72, RMSE = 3.51%), and sagebrush (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 21.03%). Spectral variation in response to changing LFMC and dry mass was difficult to isolate from broader spectral trends due to chlorophyll absorption, leaf structure, water absorption, and co-varied biochemical components. Our results stress cautious spectral interpretation and wavelength selection for LFMC estimation in some species (e.g. lodgepole pine), since temporal changes in spectra may dominantly reflect temporal variation in dry mass, pigments, and/or structure rather than water content. Since new needles should have stronger spectral expression at the canopy scale, differing temporal trends in new and old lodgepole pine needles provides an additional complicating factor for remote monitoring of LFMC.

AB Ocean color radiometry (OCR) provides valuable data for biogeochemical oceanography. In situ OCR measurements are used in the development and validation of bio-optical models and vicarious calibration of satellite ocean-color sensors. It is thus crucial to obtain accurate in situ OCR measurements, which is a challenge, especially in regions subjected to adverse environmental conditions and where waters are optically complex. In the present work, the accuracy of in situ OCR is analyzed with data acquired in a wide range of bio-geographic provinces across the Southern Atlantic and Southeastern Pacific during the R/V Melville MV1102 cruise. Varied techniques employed to measure above-water remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) are inter-compared. Measured R is also compared with modeled R-rs in a closure experiment. The impact of R-rs uncertainties on the retrieval of chlorophyll a concentration (Chla) and inherent optical properties (IOPs) is evaluated using operational bio-optical algorithms. The relative percent difference (RPD) between R-rs measured by the various techniques ranged from 12 to 26% for the ocean-color bands (412-555 nm), and 3-12% for the ratios (412-510/555). A merged R-rs obtained by averaging the different types of measurements, INS, is recommended to reduce uncertainties. The coefficient of variation of INS and reflectance ratios was 11-13% and 3-5%, respectively. The RPD between INS and modeled R-rs and the corresponding ratios ranged from 18 to 34% and from 13 to 17%, respectively. Complete closure could not be obtained due to both measurement and modeling uncertainties. The impact of INS uncertainties on retrieved Chla and IOPs was generally smaller than the intrinsic errors of the inversion schemes. The results suggest that even though more accurate ocean-color radiometry is desirable, improving retrieval algorithms is essential to properly describing and furthering our understanding of bio-optical variability in the world's oceans.

AB Hourly Sea Surface Temperature (SST) fields derived from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager (SEVIRI) onboard Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) are frequently used in studies of the diurnal cycle of the ocean. In this article, we focus on high frequency SST variability induced by tidal currents in the Iroise Sea, west of Brittany (France). This region is known for its strong tidal currents that are responsible in summer for the generation of an intense thermal front, the Ushant front We use hourly MSG/SEVIRI derived SST to compute the displacements of this front In the northern part of the front, at 48.75 degrees N, we show that the longitudinal displacements of the front on subdiurnal time scales can be explained by the Lagrangian advection induced by surface currents.
   We also present maps of surface currents computed from hourly SEVIRI derived SST data using the Maximum Cross Correlation (MCC) method. Comparison of SEVIRI derived velocities with velocities obtained with high frequency (HF) radar measurements and a hindcast numerical simulation (Mercator Ocean) gives encouraging results in the northern part of the Ushant front, near the Ushant Island. Within that region, the mean bias of the SEVIRI velocities was below 0.12 m.s(-1), with the standard deviation ranging from 0.26 ms(-1) during moderate tides to 0.49 m.s(-1) during spring tides. Further offshore, where the surface thermal structures are weaker and the SST more homogeneous, currents derived using the MCC method were overestimated by 0.3 m.s(-1) and showed larger error standard deviations.

AB We report on the relationship between the backscattering coefficient at 665 nm and the cross sectional area of particles in suspension in the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and English Channel. A plot of the backscattering coefficient against particle area shows two distinct trends: one for particles with high mineral content and another for particles with low mineral content. Backscattering per unit particle area (effective backscattering efficiency, Q(bb)) shows a continuous non-linear dependence on the ratio of mineral to total suspended solids (MSS/TSS) over the range 0.35 < MSS/TSS < 0.91. The relationship can be represented by an exponential function: Q(bb) = 0.000087 exp(6.9 MSS/TSS), which explains 62% of the observed variance in backscattering efficiency. Changes in particle size have no significant influence on Q(bb). As the MSS/TSS ratio increases, the backscattering ratio (b(b)/b) also increases. The implication for the quantitative remote sensing of marine suspended sediments is that the mass specific backscattering coefficient, b(b)* depends on the particle area per unit mass multiplied by a function which depends on the mineral content of the particles.

AB In this study, the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) land surface temperature (LST) environmental data record (EDR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) L2 swath LST products (collection 5) from both the Terra and Aqua satellites were evaluated against ground observations in an arid area of northwest China during the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (Hi WATER) experiment. Four barren surface sites were chosen for the evaluation, which took place from June 2012 to April 2013. The results show that the current VIIRS LST products demonstrate a reasonable accuracy, with an average bias of 036 K and -0.58 K and an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.74 K and 1.48 K for the four sites during daytime and nighttime, respectively. The accuracy of the nighttime LST is much better than that of daytime. Furthermore, it was also found that the VIIRS split-window (SW) algorithm provides better performance than the VIIRS dual split-window (DSW) algorithm during both daytime and nighttime. For MODIS LST products, the results show that both Terra and Aqua MODIS C5 LST products underestimate the LST for the four barren surface sites at daytime, and the biases and RMSEs are much larger for Aqua, with biases varies from -0.91 K to -3.13 K for Terra and from -131 K to -3.76 K for Aqua.

AB Classifying surface cover types and analyzing changes are among the most common applications of remote sensing. One of the most basic classification tasks is to distinguish water bodies from dry land surfaces. Landsat imagery is among the most widely used sources of data in remote sensing of water resources; and although several techniques of surface water extraction using Landsat data are described in the literature, their application is constrained by low accuracy in various situations. Besides, with the use of techniques such as single band thresholding and two-band indices, identifying an appropriate threshold yielding the highest possible accuracy is a challenging and time consuming task, as threshold values vary with location and time of image acquisition. The purpose of this study was therefore to devise an index that consistently improves water extraction accuracy in the presence of various sorts of environmental noise and at the same time offers a stable threshold value. Thus we introduced a new Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) improving classification accuracy in areas that include shadow and dark surfaces that other classification methods often fail to classify correctly. We tested the accuracy and robustness of the new method using Landsat 5 TM images of several water bodies in Denmark, Switzerland, Ethiopia, South Africa and New Zealand. Kappa coefficient, omission and commission errors were calculated to evaluate accuracies. The performance of the classifier was compared with that of the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifiers. In four out of five test sites, classification accuracy of AWEI was significantly higher than that of MNDWI and ML (P-value < 0.01). AWEI improved accuracy by lessening commission and omission errors by 50% compared to those resulting from MNDWI and about 25% compared to ML classifiers. Besides, the new method was shown to have a fairly stable optimal threshold value. Therefore, AWEI can be used for extracting water with high accuracy, especially in mountainous areas where deep shadow caused by the terrain is an important source of classification error.

AB Air-sea gas exchange is affected by sea surface roughness and a previous study shows a significant relation between Ku-band backscattering from satellite altimeters and field estimates of gas transfer velocity, K. Recently C-band backscatter data were made available for altimeters on board the JASON-1 and JASON-2 satellites. In this paper we used experimental data from the same cruises to show that using the difference between the Ku-band and C-band signals to estimate sea surface roughness, and thus reducing the contribution from longer waves, improved the K estimates. This is consistent with the theory that gas transfer is largely controlled by short capillary-gravity waves. For satellite data closer than 2 hr and 0.5 degrees from the K sample stations, the dual-frequency parameterization is found to perform better than a wind speed parameterization that uses in situ wind speed. The improvement supports the hypothesis that gas transfer is more directly related to surface roughness than to surface wind. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Precise monitoring of agricultural crop biomass and yield quantities is critical for crop production management and prediction. The goal of this study was to compare hyperspectral narrowband (HNB) versus multispectral broadband (MBB) reflectance data in studying irrigated cropland characteristics of five leading world crops (cotton, wheat, maize, rice, and alfalfa) with the objectives of: 1. Modeling crop productivity, and 2. Discriminating crop types. HNB data were obtained from Hyperion hyperspectral imager and field ASD spectroradiometer, and MBB data were obtained from five broadband sensors: Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Advanced Land Imager (ALI), Indian Remote Sensing (IRS), IKONOS, and QuickBird. A large collection of field spectral and biophysical variables were gathered for the 5 crops in Central Asia throughout the growing seasons of 2006 and 2007. Overall, the HNB and hyperspectral vegetation index (HVI) crop biophysical models explained about 25% greater variability when compared with corresponding MBB models. Typically, 3 to 7 HNBs, in multiple linear regression models of a given crop variable, explained more than 93% of variability in crop models. The evaluation of X1 (400-2500 nm) versus X2 (400-2500 nm) plots of various crop biophysical variables showed that the best two-band normalized difference HVIs involved HNBs centered at: (i) 742 nm and 1175 nm (HVI742-1175), (ii) 1296 nm and 1054 nm (HVI1296-1054), (iii) 1225 nm and 697 nm (HVI1225-697), and (iv) 702 nm and 1104 nm (HVI702-1104). Among the most frequently occurring HNBs in various crop biophysical models, 74% were located in the 1051-2331 nm spectral range, followed by 10% in the moisture sensitive 970 nm, 6% in the red and red-edge (630-752 nm), and the remaining 10% distributed between blue (400-500 nm), green (501-600 nm), and NIR (760-900 nm). Discriminant models, used for discriminating 3 or 4 or 5 crop types, showed significantly higher accuracies when using HNBs (>90%) over MBBs data (varied between 45 and 84%). Finally, the study highlighted 29 HNBs of Hyperion that are optimal in the study of agricultural crops and potentially significant to the upcoming NASA HyspIRI mission. Determining optimal and redundant bands for a given application will help overcoming the Hughes' phenomenon (or curse of high dimensionality of data). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB We apply an image correlation technique to multi-orbit and multi-temporal high-resolution (HR) SAR data. Image correlation technique has the advantage of providing displacement maps in two directions; e.g. the Line of Sight direction (LoS) and the Azimuth direction. This information, derived from the two modes of data acquisition (ascending and descending), can be combined routinely to infer the three dimensional surface displacement field at different epochs. In this study, a methodology is developed to characterize the displacement pattern of the large La Valette landslide (South French Alps) using TerraSAR-X images acquired in 2010. The results allow mapping the dynamics of different units of the La Valette landslide at high spatial resolution. The study demonstrates the potential of this new application of High Resolution SAR image correlation technique for landslide ground surface deformation monitoring. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Understanding and investigating synergies between LiDAR (light detection and ranging) and SAR (synthetic aperture radar) provide new and innovative opportunities to characterize above-ground biomass. We demonstrate a spatial modeling framework that integrates above-ground biomass transects, derived from plot-based field data and small-footprint discrete return LiDAR, with complete wall-to-wall spaceborne L-band and C-band SAR to predict biomass over a larger area. Transect intervals of 2000 m, 1000 m, and 500 m were tested. Co-kriging, regression kriging, and regression co-kriging were used to extend the LiDAR-derived biomass transects. LiDAR-derived above-ground biomass and L-band backscatter (HV polarization) were moderately correlated, with a maximum semivariance distance between the LiDAR-derived biomass and SAR data of 374 m. Regression kriging at a sample interval of 500 m showed the smallest root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) at 203.9 Mg ha(-1) and 131.6 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The mean error (ME) showed an average bias of -14.0 Mg ha(-1). Predictions using regression co-kriging at a sample interval of 2000 m resulted in the highest RMSE and MAE values at 2382 Mg ha(-1) and 164.6 Mg ha(-1), respectively. ME also was highest, averaging - 37.4 Mg ha(-1). Regardless of the spatial modeling technique employed, lower errors in predicted above-ground biomass were associated with smaller transect intervals. Moderate correlations between the LiDAR-derived above-ground biomass and the radar data impacted the predictive accuracy of the spatial models; however, overall variation in above-ground biomass in the study area was well represented. This study demonstrated that a sampling framework integrating LiDAR data with space-borne radar data using a spatial modeling approach can provide spatially-explicit above-ground biomass estimates for large areas. Such a sampling framework can be used in combination with ground plot and land cover data to assess carbon stocks under conditions where more common optical remote sensing approaches are difficult to implement.

AB Timely and accurate monitoring of forest disturbance is essential to help us understand how the Earth system is changing. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) imagery and subsequent MODIS products provide near-daily global coverage and have transformed the ways we study and monitor the Earth. To monitor forest disturbance, it is necessary to be able to compare observations of the same place from different times, but this is a challenging task using MODIS data as observations from different days have varying view angles and pixel sizes, and cover slightly different areas. In this paper, we propose a method to fuse MODIS and Landsat data in a way that allows for near real-time monitoring of forest disturbance. The method is based on using Landsat time-series images to predict the next MODIS image, which forms a stable basis for comparison with new MODIS acquisitions. The predicted MODIS images represent what the surface should look like assuming no disturbance, and the difference in the spectral signatures between predicted and observed MODIS images becomes the "signal" used for detecting forest disturbance. The method was able to detect subpixel forest disturbance with a producer's accuracy of 81% and a user's accuracy of 90%. Patches of forest disturbance as small as 5 to 7 ha in size were detected on a daily basis. The encouraging results indicate that the presented fusion method holds promise for improving monitoring of forest disturbance in near real-time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Urbanization is a global problem with emergent properties. The difference in temperature between urban and rural surfaces is one such property that affects health, energy consumption budgets, regional planning and climate. We used remotely sensed datasets and gridded population to estimate the magnitude of thermal differentials (urban heat islands and/or sinks), the timing of heat differential events, and the controlling variables. The global scope of the study provides a consistent analytical environment that enables identification of the key factors that contribute to deleterious heat differentials. We propose new indices of thermal differential and use them to show particular prevalence of heat islands and sinks in arid regions. A variable ranking analysis indicates that development intensity, vegetation amount and the size of the urban metropolis are the most important urban variables to predict heat differentials. Population was of lesser importance in this study. Urban structure indices were also ranked lower, though a different measurement scale qualifies this conclusion. The results support the paradigm of compact development and incorporation of vegetation to the urban infrastructure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The analysis of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll archive shows a quasi-persistent strip of oligotrophic waters (chl < 0.1 mg m(-3)) extending over about 20 degrees longitude in the eastern part of the equatorial Pacific warm pool. Other space-borne data sets (scatterometric wind, microwave sea surface temperature (SST), altimetric sea level, and surface currents) were used together with barrier layer thickness derived from Argo floats to investigate the variability of the oligotrophic zone and of its eastern and western boundaries, and to propose processes that could explain why surface chlorophyll is so low in this region. The eastern limit of the oligotrophic waters matches the eastern edge of the warm pool and moves zonally both at seasonal time scale and with the El Nino/La Nina phases whereas the western limit moves mostly at intraseasonal and interannual time scales. On average, about half of the surface of the zone is occupied by very oligotrophic waters (chl < 0.07 mg m(-3)) located in the eastern part. The degree of oligotrophy of the zone increases when its width is maximum during boreal fall and winter and during El Nino events. Oligotrophy in the eastern part of the warm pool most likely persists because of the lack of vertical or horizontal penetration of nutrient-rich water due to the following processes. 1/ The equatorial oligotrophic warm pool is bounded poleward by the oligotrophic subtropical gyres. 2/The deep nutrient pool prevents strong vertical nutrient inputs into the euphoric layer and the barrier layer above it potentially reduces the efficiency of mixing. 3/ During westerly wind events, mesotrophic waters in the far western basin are too distant from the oligotrophic zone to be efficient nutrient and phytoplankton sources, and become nutrient and phytoplankton depleted during their eastward advection. 4/ Nutrient-rich waters from the central basin and nutrient-poor surface waters of the warm pool do not blend because of subduction at the eastern limit of the oligotrophic zone.

AB The Peruvian Coastal Upwelling System (PCUS) is one of the most productive fisheries in the world. Upwelling events are associated with changes in the magnitude and location of frontal structures. SST gradients from four different data sets, NCDC, REMSS, OSTIA, and MUR are compared in two test areas off the PCUS: Paita (5 degrees S) and Pisco (14 degrees S). In both areas gradients derived from the MUR data set show greater magnitudes, as well as larger seasonal cycles. Off Pisco, the magnitude of the seasonal cycle of 2.2 degrees C/100 km in MUR is larger than the one derived from the lower resolution data sets. All data sets at Pisco exhibit a seasonal cycle that peaks in late Austral summer and early fall. Hovmoller diagrams calculated at 5.5 degrees S, 10.5 degrees S, and 14.5 degrees S show clearly defined offshore maxima in the cross-shore gradients for all the data sets. Upwelling scales determined by the distance to the first maxima vary depending on the data set used. At 5.5 degrees S upwelling scales vary from 10 km for MUR to 50 km for NCDC At 14.5 degrees S the scales vary from 20 km for MUR to 40 km for OSTIA. All four data sets show similar large-scale structures associated with the Peruvian upwelling. However, MUR shows finer scale structures that are most likely due to submesoscale to mesoscale eddies. Sub-sampled MUR 1 km data at the 25 km, 9 km, and 4 km resolutions compare well in magnitude and phase with the lower resolution products. Agreement in gradient magnitude between the lower resolution data sets and the MUR sub-sampled at their respective resolutions implies that the pixel-to-pixel analysis noise in MUR is at a similar level as the other data sets.

AB Quantification of global carbon storage, carbon flux and disturbance in forested regions is of critical importance to refining our understanding of ecosystem processes, climate modeling and climate change. Remote sensing instruments, such as lidar and radar provide a means of obtaining highly accurate and well resolved biomass estimates over global scales. This has sparked interest in mission concepts such as DESDynI. One of the core objectives of the proposed DESDynI mission was global carbon accounting and monitoring through a combination of lidar and radar measurements. In this article, the relationship between field biomass and lidar metrics is analyzed using data from coordinated field measurements and lidar overflights at the Harvard and Howland Forests in North-Eastern United States to assess the performance of a potential biomass mapping instrument. Results show that the performance of lidar estimates of biomass vary significantly between the two sites even though they belong to the same northern temperate forest ecoregion. An attempt is made to isolate the reasons behind the dissimilarities. While RMS errors as low as 30 tons/ha can be seen, these are limited to biomass ranges of up to 300 tons/ha.

AB Green vegetation (GV), nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil are important ground cover components in terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. There are many good methods for observing the dynamics of GV with optical remote sensing, but there are fewer good methods for observing the dynamics of NPV and soil. Given the difficulty of remotely deriving information on NPV and soil, the purpose of this study is to evaluate several methods for the retrieval of information on fractional cover of GV, NPV, and soil using 500-m MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) data. In particular, three spectral mixture analysis (SMA) techniques are evaluated: simple SMA, multiple-endmember SMA (MESMA), and relative SMA (RSMA). In situ cover data from agricultural fields in Southern Australia are used as the basis for comparison. RSMA provides an index of fractional cover of GV, NPV, and soil, so a method for converting these to absolute fractional cover estimates is also described and evaluated. All methods displayed statistically significant correlations with in situ data. All methods proved equally capable at predicting the dynamics of GV. MESMA predicted NPV dynamics best RSMA predicted dynamics of soil best The method for converting RSMA indices to fractional cover estimates provided estimates that were comparable to those provided by SMA and MESMA. Although it does not always provide the best estimates of ground component dynamics, this study shows that RSMA indices are useful indicators of GV, NPV, and soil cover. However, our results indicate that the choice of unmixing technique and its implementation ought to be application-specific, with particular emphasis on which ground cover retrieval requires the greatest accuracy and how much ancillary data is available to support the analysis.

AB Without better estimates of soil properties than are currently available from coarse-scale maps, it is difficult to predict forest productivity accurately across broad regions. While soil properties are not directly available from remote sensing data, they can potentially be inferred from linking these properties to observations that are readily available from satellite data, such as vegetation leaf area. We took advantage of the direct link that exists between above-ground productivity and maximum leaf area index (LAI(max)) to derive and map soil fertility (FR) and available soil water storage capacity (ASWC) at 1 km resolution across forested areas in western North America. Initially, we generated estimates of LAI(max) with a process-based growth model (3-PG), holding soil properties constant (FR=50% of maximum, ASWC=200 mm). To derive more realistic estimates of soil properties we inverted the model to infer FR and ASWC from iterative non-linear adjustments of the two soil properties so that model-predicted LAI(max) values corresponded closely with MODIS-derived observations. We parameterized 3-PG for the most widely distributed tree species in the region, Douglas-fir. The resulting maps were notably more detailed than those derived from the globally available Harmonized World Soil Database. Among 51, level III ecoregions, and the ranges in the two soil properties tended to increase in parallel with LAI(max). Further improvements in the approach are envisioned by combining MODIS and LiDAR observations to extend the range and accuracy of LAI(max) observations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Echidna Validation Instrument (EVI), a ground-based. near-infrared (1064 nm) scanning lidar, provides gap fraction measurements, element clumping index measurements, effective leaf area index (LAI(e)) and leaf area index (LAI) measurements that are statistically similar to those from hemispherical photos. In this research, a new method integrating the range dimension is presented for retrieving element clumping index using a unique series of images of gap probability (Pgap) with range from EVI. From these images, we identified connected gap components and found the approximate physical, rather than angular, size of connected gap component. We conducted trials at 30 plots within six conifer stands of varying height and stocking densities in the Sierra National Forest, CA. in August 2008. The element clumping index measurements retrieved from EVI Pgap image series for the hinge angle region are highly consistent (R-2 = 0.866) with those of hemispherical photos. Furthermore, the information contained in connected gap component size profiles does account for the difference between our method and gap-size distribution theory based method, suggesting a new perspective to measure element clumping index with EVI Pgap image series and also a potential advantage of three dimensional Lidar data for element clumping index retrieval. Therefore further exploration is required for better characterization of clumped condition from EVI Pgap image series. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Retrievals of atmospheric trace gas column densities from space are compromised by the presence of clouds, requiring most studies to exclude observations with significant cloud fractions in the instrument's field of view. Using NO2 observations at three ground stations representing urban, suburban, and rural environments, and tropospheric vertical column densities measured by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over each site, we show that the observations from space represent monthly averaged ground-level pollutant conditions well (R = 0.86) under relatively cloud-free conditions. However, by analyzing the ground-level data and applying the OMI cloud fraction as a filter, we show there is a significant bias in long-term averaged NO2 as a result of removing the data during cloudy conditions. For the ground-based sites considered in this study, excluding observations on days when OMI-derived cloud fractions were greater than 0.2 causes 12:00-14:00 mean summer mixing ratios to be underestimated by 12% +/- 6%, 20% +/- 7%, and 40% +/- 10% on average (+/- 1 standard deviation) at the urban, suburban, and rural sites respectively. This bias was investigated in particular at the rural site, a region where pollutant transport is the main source of NO2, and where long-term observations of NOy were also available. Evidence of changing photochemical conditions and a correlation between clear skies and the transport of cleaner air masses play key roles in explaining the bias. The magnitude of a bias is expected to vary from site to site depending on meteorology and proximity to NOx sources, and decreases when longer averaging times of ground station data (e.g. 24-h) are used for the comparison.

AB NOAA will soon use the new Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) as its primary polar-orbiting satellite imager. Employing a near real-time processing system, NOAA will generate a series of Environmental Data Records (EDRs) from VIIRS data. For example, the VIIRS Land Surface Temperature (LST) EDR will estimate the surface skin temperature over all global land areas and provide key information for monitoring Earth surface energy and water fluxes. Because both VIIRS and its processing algorithms are new, NOAA is conducting a rigorous calibration and validation program to understand and improve product quality. This paper presents a new validation methodology to estimate the quantitative uncertainty in the LST EDR, and contribute to improving the retrieval algorithm. It employs a physically-based approach to scaling up point LST measurements currently made operationally at many field and weather stations around the world. The scaling method consists of the merging information collected at different spatial resolutions within a land surface model to fully characterize large area (km x km scale) satellite products. The approach can be used to explore scaling issues over terrestrial surfaces spanning a large range of climate regimes and land cover types, including forests and mixed vegetated areas. The methodology was tested successfully with NASA/MODIS data, indicating an absolute error for MODIS LST products of 2.0 K at a mixed agricultural site (Bondville, IL) when accounting for scaling, and higher than 3 K without scaling. The VIIRS LST EDR requires a 1.5 K measurement accuracy and 2.5 K measurement precision. Ultimately, this validation approach should lead to an accurate and continuously-assessed VIIRS LST product suitable to support weather forecast, hydrological applications, or climate studies. It is readily adaptable to other moderate resolution satellite systems. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a combination of techniques suitable for remotely sensing foliar Nitrogen (N) in semiarid shrublands - a capability that would significantly improve our limited understanding of vegetation functionality in dryland ecosystems. The ability to estimate foliar N distributions across arid and semi-arid environments could help answer process-driven questions related to topics such as controls on canopy photosynthesis, the influence of N on carbon cycling behavior, nutrient pulse dynamics, and post-fire recovery. Our study determined that further exploration into estimating sagebrush canopy N concentrations from an airborne platform is warranted, despite remote sensing challenges inherent to open canopy systems. Hyperspectral data transformed using standard derivative analysis were capable of quantifying sagebrush canopy N concentrations using partial least squares (PLS) regression with an R-2 value of 0.72 and an R-2 predicted value of 0.42 (n = 35). Subsetting the dataset to minimize the influence of bare ground (n = 19) increased R-2 to 0.95 (R-2 predicted = 0.56). Ground-based estimates of canopy N using leaf mass per unit area measurements (LMA) yielded consistently better model fits than ground-based estimates of canopy N using cover and height measurements. The LMA approach is likely a method that could be extended to other semiarid shrublands. Overall, the results of this study are encouraging for future landscape scale N estimates and represent an important step in addressing the confounding influence of bare ground, which we found to be a major influence on predictions of sagebrush canopy N from an airborne platform.

TI Lidar sampling - Using an airborne profiler to estimate forest biomass

AB An airborne profiling lidar was used to estimate total aboveground dry biomass, a surrogate for aboveground carbon stocks, for all land cover types in Hedmark County, Norway. One-hundred-five parallel profiling flight lines systematically spaced three km apart, totaling 8309 km, were acquired to measure forest canopy height and density across the 27,390 km(2) County. Two sampling/estimation strategies were investigated; both use profiling lidar data to augment field data collected as part of a systematic network of Norwegian National Forest Inventory (NFI) ground plots. The two strategies include (1) a model-dependent (MD), two-phase approach which permits calculation of sampling and model error, and (2) a model-assisted (MA), probability-based, two-stage approach which utilizes asymptotically design-unbiased estimators. The lidar-augmented survey results from these two sampling strategies were compared to NFI ground estimates for the County. The MD estimate (38.88 +/- 1.07 Mg ha(-1), one a) differs from the NFI ground estimate (37.64 +/- 0.94 Mg ha(-1)) by +1.24 Mg ha(-1) (+3.3%) and the MA (36.09 +/- 1.56 Mg ha(-1)) versus NFI difference is -1.55 Mg ha(-1) (-4.1%). As expected, as smaller geographical areas are considered, lidar-NFI differences increase, and at the individual cover class level, MD lidar-ground absolute differences average 3.1 Mg ha(-1) for the eight individual classes (8.2% of the County mean). The comparable MA lidar-ground average absolute difference for the individual cover classes is 4.3 Mg ha(-1) (11.4% of the County mean). For all of Hedmark, in general, the MD approach agreed most closely with NFI estimates. The standard errors (SE) generated using the MA approach were, in general, 2-3 times larger than the MD SEs for productive forest classes at the County level, though neither lidar sample was consistently more precise than the NFI ground estimates alone. For Hedmark County, the results indicate that profiling lidar surveys can provide estimates comparable to ground surveys but, at this particular juncture, the MD and MA estimators did not improve the precision of adequately designed (in terms of sample size), probability-based ground samples. However when smaller political units are considered, i.e., as estimates are made on smaller and smaller subunits within Hedmark County, in general, MD-SE < NFI-SE << MA-SE. Of the two designs considered in this study, the MD approach is most amenable to satellite lidar surveys since it does not require that profiling lidar satellite pulses intercept ground plots already established for a regional or national forest inventory. Direct comparisons of lidar and ground SEs are complicated by two factors: (1) the influence of treating both lidar and ground surveys as random samples when, in fact, they're systematic, and (2) by the two stage/phase structure of the lidar surveys versus the single stage structure of the NFI. These results should be viewed as preliminary, subject to validation using a Monte Carlo simulator. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The density of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) sapling regeneration was mapped in areas burned during the 1988 wildfires across Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Wyoming, USA. Hyperspectral image analysis and field measurements were combined across the entire YNP extent. Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image data from 2006 were used to compute ten different vegetation indices (VI). The ten VIs were combined to build multiple regression models for predicting and mapping post-fire sapling density. Four different forms of regression modeling were applied to derive the highest possible prediction accuracy (correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.83). Pine sapling regeneration 19 years after large-scale wildfires showed a high level of variability in patch density (ranging from 14/100 ha to 57/100 ha), whereas sapling density measured previously from the first decade following wildfire was more uniform (10/100 ha to 21/100 ha). The ecosystem-level dumpiness index showed major shifts in aggregation of different sapling density classes, and was consistent with an overall decrease in estimated sapling density of nearly 50% between 1998 and 2007. This analysis revealed important succession patterns and processes in post-fire forest regeneration for the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Atmospheric chemistry observations from space have been made for more than 30 years. They have been motivated by the concern about a number of environmental issues. However, most of the space instruments have been designed for scientific research, improving the understanding of processes that govern stratospheric ozone depletion, climate change and the transport of pollutants starting with the BUV instrument on Nimbus-4. Long-term continuous time series of atmospheric trace gas data have been limited to stratospheric ozone and a few related species. According to current planning, meteorological satellites will maintain some of these observations over the next decade. They will also add some measurements of tropospheric climate-relevant gases. As their measurements are motivated by meeting operational meteorology needs, they fall short in meeting requirements for atmospheric chemistry applications.
   Reliable long-term space-based monitoring of atmospheric constituents with quality attributes sufficient to serve atmospheric chemistry applications still needs to be established. The general framework for this kind of measurements, in synergy with ground-based and airborne measurements and integration with atmospheric models and data assimilation schemes, has been outlined in the IGOS-IGACO Theme Report (Barrie & Langen, 2004). Several other efforts have been made to identify the needs of long-term atmospheric composition data, such as
   the GMES-GATO report (2004),
   Report of the GMES atmospheric service (GAS) Implementation Group (GACS, 2009),
   Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Implementation Plan (GCOS, 2010),
   Report of the Protocol Monitoring for the GMES Service Element, Atmosphere Service (PROMOTE, 2009),
   studies commissioned by EUMETSAT to identify requirements for geostationary platforms in the context of Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) (Lelieveld, 2003), and
   the position paper of the EUMETSAT post-EPS Application Expert Group on atmospheric chemistry (Kelder et al., 2006).
   An ESA study on 'Operational Atmospheric Chemistry Monitoring Missions (CAPACITY)' (Kelder et al., 2007) had established comprehensive observational requirements by environmental theme, by user group, and by observational system (ground/satellite). The study assessed the contributions of existing missions to the fulfilment of these requirements and identified priorities of future observational capabilities for atmospheric composition. The ESA study on 'Observation Techniques and Mission Concepts for Atmospheric Chemistry' (CAMELOT, Levelt et al., 2009) contributed to the definition of the space based monitoring capabilities of GMES for air quality protocol monitoring, air-quality near-real-time applications, and climate protocol monitoring in the time frame 2012-2020: The key objective of the CAMELOT study was to consolidate requirements at radiance level, i.e. Level-1, for the Sentinel-4 and -5 missions.
   The need for space based atmospheric composition monitoring will be addressed by a variety of instruments. A significant contribution will be provided by the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) Sentinel-4 and -5 systems where Sentinel-4 provides a geosynchronous component with a European focus and Sentinel-5 a low Earth orbiting component with global coverage. Sentinel-5p will bridge the gap between existing missions, i.e. Sciamachy on Envisat and OMI on EOS-Aura, and Sentinel-5. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The GMES atmospheric services include global and European air quality monitoring and forecasting which require near real time delivery of atmospheric CO abundances. To achieve this, a numerically efficient retrieval approach for operational data processing is needed to derive CO column densities from shortwave infrared measurements in the 2.3 mu m band of the Sentinel 5 missions and its Precursor mission. The expected performance of both spectrometers will allow for clear-sky CO column retrievals over land with a precision of <= 10% and an overall accuracy of <= 15% even for background CO abundance and low surface reflection in the shortwave infrared spectral range. In this context, we present a new algorithm approach of the retrieval of CO from shortwave infrared measurements in clear sky and partially cloudy atmospheres over land and ocean surfaces. The algorithm employs simplified radiative transfer, where the model atmosphere is separated in a clear sky part, and a part which is bounded below by an elevated Lambertian reflector to account for atmospheric scattering by clouds and aerosols. Within the inversion scheme, Tikhonov regularization is used to determine, for each individual measurement, not only the vertically integrated CO column density and its retrieval error, but also the column averaging kernel. For the retrieval, a prior estimate of methane abundance is used to characterize the light path by retrieving effective cloud parameters from the shortwave infrared band itself. A performance analysis shows that, for a single cloud layer in the middle and lower troposphere, the bias on the CO retrieval due to the Lambertian cloud model is less than 2-3%. The effect of boundary layer aerosols can also be treated with similar accuracy. In contrast, the presence of elevated dust plumes above bright surfaces or a single layer cirrus cloud causes significant errors and, in these cases, a reasonably low retrieval bias can only be achieved for an optical depth in the shortwave infrared spectral range lower than 0.4. Another relevant error source for the CO retrieval algorithm is given by the prior uncertainty of methane. It is found that a 5% uncertainty in the methane column density causes biases of 3-9% on the retrieved CO column, depending on cloud fraction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) effect is defined as the increased surface temperature in urban areas in contrast to surrounding cooler temperatures in rural areas. In this paper, we study the characteristics that a spaceborne sensor must satisfy in terms of spatial resolution and overpass time to properly monitor the SUHI effect. For this, Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps, generated at different spatial resolution using the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) imagery, and in situ data of air temperature and LST obtained from the framework of the Dual-use European Security IR Experiment 2008 have been considered for the city of Madrid (Spain). The results showed that (1) spatial resolutions greater than 50 m are needed to properly estimate the SUHI effect at district level and (2) the recommended satellite overpass time is immediately before sunrise.

AB In this paper the soil moisture is estimated at airborne level and at satellite level by combining remotely sensed images with in situ measurements. At airborne level we process high-resolution images acquired with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) sensor, and at satellite level we compute images acquired with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). The study has been accomplished in the framework of two field campaigns in the Barrax region (Spain): the SEN2FLEX (SENtinel-2 and FLuorescence EXperiment) campaign which was developed in July of 2005 and the SEN3EXP (Sentinel-3 Experiment) campaign which was carried out in June of 2009. The methodology proposed considers the correlation between the surface temperature, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the emissivity. With this methodology the soil moisture from AHS data can be obtained with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.05 m(3)/m(3) compared with ground measurements and from ASTER images with a RMSE of 0.06 m(3)/m(3).

AB Accurate areal measurements of snow cover extent are important for hydrological and climate modeling. The traditional method of mapping snow cover is binary where a pixel is considered either snow-covered or snow-free. Fractional snow cover (FSC) mapping can achieve a more precise estimate of areal snow cover extent by estimating the fraction of a pixel that is snow-covered. The most common snow fraction methods applied to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images have been spectral unmixing and an empirical Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). Machine learning is an alternative for estimating FSC as artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been successfully used for estimating the subpixel abundances of other surfaces. The advantages of ANNs are that they can easily incorporate auxiliary information such as land cover type and are capable of learning nonlinear relationships between surface reflectance and snow fraction. ANNs are especially applicable to mapping snow cover extent in forested areas where spatial mixing of surface components is nonlinear. This study developed a multilayer feed-forward ANN trained through backpropagation to estimate FSC using MODIS surface reflectance, NDSI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land cover as inputs. The ANN was trained and validated with higher spatial-resolution FSC maps derived from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) binary snow cover maps. Testing of the network was accomplished over training and independent test areas. The developed network performed adequately with RMSE of 12% over training areas and slightly less accurately over the independent test scenes with RMSE of 14%. The developed ANN also compared favorably to the standard MODIS FSC product. The study also presents a comprehensive validation of the standard MODIS snow fraction product whose performance was found to be similar to that of the ANN. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Ocean transparency, often measured using Secchi disk, is a useful index of water quality or productivity and is used in many environmental studies. The spaceborne ocean color sensors provide synoptic and regular radiometric data and can be used for applying environmental policies if the data is converted into relevant biogeochemical properties. We adapted and developed semi-analytical and empirical algorithms to estimate the Secchi depth from satellite ocean color data in both coastal and oceanic waters. The development of the algorithms is based on the use of a comprehensive in situ bio-optical dataset The algorithms are validated using an extensive set of coincident satellite estimates and in situ measurements of the Secchi depth (so-called matchups). More than 400 matchups are compiled for the MERIS, MODIS and SeaWiFS sensors. The comparison between Secchi depth retrievals from remote sensing data and in situ measurements yields determination coefficients (R-2) between 0.50 and 0.73, depending on the sensor and algorithm. The type II linear regression slopes and intercepts vary between 0.95 and 1.46, and between -0.8 and 6.2 in, respectively. While semi-analytical algorithms provide the most promising results on in situ data, the empirical one proves to be more robust on remote sensing data because it is less sensitive to error due to erroneous atmospheric corrections. Using ocean color archives, one can derive maps of ocean transparency for different areas. Our climatology of the Secchi depth based on ocean color for the transition zone between the North Sea and Baltic Sea is compared to an historical dataset (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data with their long-term (1981-current) global coverage at frequent intervals provide unique opportunities to explore vegetation dynamics related to climate variability, climate change, and land-use driven changes of land cover. Several AVHRR-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data sets exist, each based on the AVHRR Global Area Coverage archive but differing in their processing to correct for sensor and atmospheric effects. This paper presents a global comparative analysis for the land surface involving four AVHRR-derived NDVI data sets: (1) Pathfinder AVHRR Land (PAL); (2) Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS); (3) Land Long Term Data Record (LTDR) version 3 (V3); and (4) Fourier-Adjustment, Solar zenith angle corrected, Interpolated Reconstructed (FASIR). Our aims are two-fold: (1) to assess the level of agreement of the medians, trends, and variances, as well as the correlation between the four AVEIRR-NDVI data sets from 1982 to 1999; and (2) to independently assess the performance of each AVHRR-NDVI data set, and that of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI, using 11,764 Landsat samples of 20 x 20 km(2) located globally covering every major land-cover type. For the AVHRR-NDVI intercomparison equal medians, variance, and trends, and no correlation between all the respective AVHRR-NDVI data sets were found for 9.9%, 45.5%,48.1% and 38.4% of the total land surface, respectively (p >= 0.05). For the four AVHRR-NDVI data sets we found: (1) consistent trends for the tundra and particularly Australia; (2) inconsistent trends for Europe. Africa, and the Sahel; and (3) moderately consistent trends for the rest of the terrestrial land surface including North America and China. The PAL and LTDR V3 data sets lack calibration, as evidenced by the presence of apparent trends in desert areas. In the Landsat-NDVI vs. AVFIRR-NDVI comparison of absolute values the LTDR V3 data set performed best, whereas in the comparison of temporal-change values the GIMMS data set performed best. In both analyses MODIS-NDVI performed better than any AVHRR-NDVI data set The simple average of the four AVHRR-NDVI data sets produced better results than either AVHRR-NDVI data set alone, indicating that the errors between the data sets are at least partially unrelated. This research emphasizes the implications of AVHRR-NDVI data set choice for studies assessing the vegetation response to climate change and modeling of the terrestrial carbon balance.

AB Snow is a medium that exhibits highly anisotropic reflectance throughout the solar spectrum. The anisotropic nature of snow shows more variability in snow metamorphic processes for wavelengths beyond 1.0 mu m than in the visible spectrum. This behavior poses challenges for the development of a model that can retrieve broadband albedo from reflectance measurements throughout the snow season. In this paper, a semi-empirical model is presented to estimate near infrared (0.8-2.5 mu m) albedo of snow. This model estimates spectral albedo at a wavelength of 1.240 mu m using only three variables: solar zenith angle, scattering angle and measured reflectance, which is used to retrieve near infrared albedo. To form a base for such a model, quantification of reflectance patterns and variability in varying snow condition, i.e. snow grain size, and sun-sensor geometry are prerequisite. In this study the DIScrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (DISORT) model is used to simulate bi-directional reflectance. The performance of the developed model is evaluated by using DISORT simulated spectral albedo for various snow grain sizes and solar zenith angles, as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and in-situ measurements. The developed model is shown to be capable of estimating spectral albedo at 1.240 mu m with acceptable accuracy. The mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) in the estimates are found to be 0.053, 0.055 and 0.064, respectively, fora wide range of sun-sensor geometries and snow grain sizes. The model shows better accuracy for spectral albedo estimates than for those computed using the Lambertian reflectance assumption for snow, reducing the error in the range and standard deviation by 75% and 65%, respectively. Applying the model to MODIS, the retrieved albedo is found to be in good quantitative agreement (r = 0.82) with in-situ measurements. These improvements in albedo estimation should allow more accurate use of remote sensing measurements in climate and hydrological models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a method for the semi-automatic recognition and mapping of recent rainfall induced shallow landslides. The method exploits VHR panchromatic and HR multispectral satellite images, and was tested in a 9.4 km(2) area in Sicily, Italy, where on 1 October 2009 a high intensity rainfall event caused shallow landslides, soil erosion, and inundation. Pre-event and post-event images of the study area taken by the QuickBird satellite, and information on the location and type of landslides obtained in the field and through the interpretation of post-event aerial photographs, were used to construct and validate a set of terrain classification models. The models classify each image element (pixel) based on the probability that the pixel contains (or does not contain) a new rainfall induced landslide. To construct and validate the models, a procedure in five steps was adopted. First, the pre-event and the post-event images were pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, co-registered, and corrected for atmospheric disturbance. Next, variables describing changes between the pre-event and the post-event images attributed to landslide occurrence were selected. Next, three classification models were calibrated in a training area using different multivariate statistical techniques. The calibrated models were then applied in a validation area using the same set of independent variables, and the same statistical techniques. Lastly, combined terrain classification models were prepared for the training and the validation areas. The performances of the models were evaluated using four-fold plots and receiver operating characteristic curves. The method proved capable of detecting and mapping the new rainfall induced landslides in the study area. We expect the method to be capable of detecting analogous shallow landslides caused by similar (rainfall) or different (e.g. earthquake) triggers, provided that the event slope failures leave discernable features captured by the post-event satellite images, and that the terrain information and satellite images are of adequate quality. The proposed method can facilitate the rapid production of accurate landslide event-inventory maps, and we expect that it will improve our ability to map landslides consistently over large areas. Application of the method will advance our ability to evaluate landslide hazards, and will foster our understanding of the evolution of landscapes shaped by mass-wasting processes.

AB In the context of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) and the international effort to reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, a reliable assessment of aboveground forest biomass is a major requirement. Especially in tropical forests which store huge amounts of carbon, a precise quantification of aboveground biomass is of high relevance for REDD activities. This study investigates the potential of X- and L-band SAR data to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in intact and degraded tropical forests in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, Indonesia. Based on forest inventory data, aboveground biomass was first estimated using LiDAR data. These results were then used to calibrate SAR backscatter images and to upscale the biomass estimates across large areas and ecosystems. This upscaling approach not only provided aboveground biomass estimates over the whole biomass range from woody regrowth to mature pristine forest but also revealed a spatial variation due to varying growth condition within specific forest types. Single and combined frequencies, as well as mono- and multi-temporal TerraSAR-X and ALOS PALSAR biomass estimation models were analyzed for the development of accurate biomass estimations. Regarding the single frequency analysis overall ALOS PALSAR backscatter is more sensitive to AGB than TerraSAR-X, especially in the higher biomass range (>100 t/ha). However, ALOS PALSAR results were less accurate in low biomass ranges due to a higher variance. The multi-temporal L- and X-band combined model achieved the best result and was therefore tested for its temporal and spatial transferability. The achieved accuracy for this model using nearly 400 independent validation points was r(2) = 0.53 with an RMSE of 79 t/ha. The model is valid up to 307 t/ha with an accuracy requirement of 50 t/ha and up to 614 t/ha with an accuracy requirement of 100 t/ha in flat terrain. The results demonstrate that direct biomass measurements based on the synergistic use of L- and X-band SAR can provide large-scale AGB estimations for tropical forests.

AB Rain-use efficiency (RUE; the ratio of vegetation productivity to annual precipitation) has been suggested as a measure for assessing land degradation in arid/semi-arid areas. In the absence of anthropogenic influence. RUE has been reported to be constant over time, and any observed change may therefore be attributed to non-rainfall impacts. This study presents an analysis of the decadal time-scale changes in the relationship between a proxy for vegetation productivity (Sigma NDVI) and annual rainfall in the Sahel-Sudanian zone of Africa. The aim is to test the quality of data input and the usefulness of both the RUE approach and an alternative method for separating the effects on vegetation productivity of rainfall change and human impact. The analyses are based on earth observation of both rainfall (GPCP (Global Precipitation Climatology Project), 1982-2007 and RFE (Rainfall Estimate) (1996-2007)) and Sigma NDVI (AVHRR GIMMS NDVI dataset, 1982-2007). It is shown that the increase in Sigma NDVI has been substantial in the Sahel-Sudanian zone over the 1982-2007 period, whereas for the period 1996-2007 the pattern of Sigma NDVI trends is more complex. Also, trend analysis of annual rainfall from GPCP data (2.5 degrees resolution) and RFE data (0.1 degrees resolution) suggests that rainfall has increased over both periods. Further it is shown that RUE values are highly correlated to rainfall, undermining the use of earth observation (EO)-based RUE (using Sigma NDVI) as a means of separating rainfall impacts from other factors. An alternative method identify temporal trends in residuals of Sigma NDVI, after regressing it against annual rainfall, is tested, yet is shown to be useful only where a high correlation between Sigma NDVI and annual rainfall exists. For the areas in the Sahel-Sudanian zone for which this condition is fulfilled, trend analyses suggest very limited anthropogenic land degradation in the Sahel-Sudanian zone. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB We present a simple algorithm to identify Karenia brevis blooms in the Gulf of Mexico along the west coast of Florida in satellite imagery. It is based on an empirical analysis of collocated matchups of satellite and in situ measurements. The results of this Empirical Approach is compared to those of a Bio-optical Technique - taken from the published literature - and the Operational Method currently implemented by the NOAA Harmful Algal Bloom Forecasting System for K. brevis blooms. These three algorithms are evaluated using a multi-year MODIS data set (from July, 2002 to October, 2006) and a long-term in situ database. Matchup pairs, consisting of remotely-sensed ocean color parameters and near-coincident field measurements of K. brevis concentration, are used to assess the accuracy of the algorithms. Fair evaluation of the algorithms was only possible in the central west Florida shelf (i.e. between 25.75 degrees N and 28.25 degrees N) during the boreal Summer and Fall months (i.e. July to December) due to the availability of valid cloud-free matchups. Even though the predictive values of the three algorithms are similar, the statistical measure of success in red tide identification (defined as cell counts in excess of 1.5 x 10(4) cells L-1) varied considerably (sensitivity - Empirical: 86%; Bio-optical: 77%; Operational: 26%), as did their effectiveness in identifying non-bloom cases (specificity Empirical: 53%; Bio-optical: 65%; Operational: 84%). As the Operational Method had an elevated frequency of false-negative cases (i.e. presented low accuracy in detecting known red tides), and because of the considerable overlap between the optical characteristics of the red tide and non-bloom population, only the other two algorithms underwent a procedure for further inspecting possible detection improvements. Both optimized versions of the Empirical and Bio-optical algorithms performed similarly, being equally specific and sensitive (similar to 70% for both) and showing low levels of uncertainties (i.e. few cases of false-negatives and false-positives: similar to 30%) improved positive predictive values (similar to 60%) were also observed along with good negative predictive values (similar to 80%).

   SEQUESTRATION; REFLECTANCE; ACCURACY
AB Conservation tillage management has been advocated for carbon sequestration and soil quality preservation purposes. Past satellite image analyses have had difficulty in differentiating between no-till (NT) and minimal tillage (MT) conservation classes due to similarities in surface residues, and may have been restricted by the availability of cloud-free satellite imagery. This study hypothesized that the inclusion of high temporal data into the classification process would increase conservation tillage accuracy due to the added likelihood of capturing spectral changes in MT fields following a tillage disturbance. Classification accuracies were evaluated for Random Forest models based on 250-m and 500-m MODIS, 30-m Landsat, and 30-m synthetic reflectance values. Synthetic (30-m) data derived from the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) were evaluated because high frequency Landsat image sets are often unavailable within a cropping season due to cloud issues. Classification results from a five-date Landsat model were substantially better than those reported by previous classification tillage studies, with 94% total and >= 88% class producer's accuracies. Landsat-derived models based on individual image scenes (May through August) yielded poor MT classifications, but a monthly increase in accuracy illustrated the importance of temporal sampling for capturing regional tillage disturbance signatures. MODIS-based model accuracies (90% total; >= 82% class) were lower than in the five-date Landsat model, but were higher than previous image-based and survey-based tillage classification results. Almost all the STARFM prediction-based models had classification accuracies higher than, or comparable to, the MODIS-based results (>90% total; >= 84% class) but the resulting model accuracies were dependent on the MODIS/Landsat base pairs used to generate the STARFM predictions. Also evident within the STARFM prediction-based models was the ability for high frequency data series to compensate for degraded synthetic spectral values when classifying field-based tillage. The decision to use MODIS or STARFM-based data within conservation tillage analysis is likely situation dependent. A MODIS-based approach requires little data processing and could be more efficient for large-area mapping; however a STARFM-based analysis might be more appropriate in mixed-pixel situations that could potentially compromise classification accuracy.

AB Motivated by the first availability of more than 16 years (1992-2009) of merged altimeter data from up to four concurrent satellite missions with TOPEX/Poseidon, ERS-1 and 2, ENVISAT, Jason-1, and Geosat Follow-On, the global sea level is reexamined with special emphasis on its distinctive scales of variability. The global sea level variability is dominated by eleven statistically significant and geographically robust principal modes at seasonal-to-decadal timescales. The identified modes can be divided into four regimes, i.e., the seasonal regime with two principal components at 3 and 6 months, the annual regime with a single 12-month component of global dominance, the interannual regime with seven principal components at 1.55, 1.74, 1.94, 2.34, 3.07, 4.20, and 5.40 years, as well as the decadal regime with a 9.28-year subdecadal component. The frequency dispersion of the identified modes is found to be at similar to 0% level for the annual regime, at similar to 5% level for the seasonal and interannual regimes, and at similar to 10% level for the decadal regime. In the space domain, the locations of principal modes are found to be geographically correlated. The seasonal regime is characterized by a small number of localized amplitude highs in regional seas. The annual regime is associated with major western boundary currents of the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio. For the interannual regime, mode active zones are observed in the western Pacific warm pool (WPWP), El Nino, and western Indian Ocean regions, among which the WPWP has a well-defined two-core structure, and the northern core coincides with the most energetic zone of the decadal regime. Another interesting finding is that east-west (zonal) and equatorial-extratropical (meridional) teleconnections are evident for the major signals in a rather symmetric and systematic pattern. Joint spatiotemporal analysis reveals that multi-modality at a given location and multi-regionality for a given mode are fundamental features in global sea level variability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB Imaging spectroscopy is a powerful tool for mapping surface mineralogy. Interactions of energy and surface materials on atomic and molecular levels result in specific absorption features that are diagnostic of mineralogy. Hyperspectral airborne sensors such as HyMap have sufficient spectral resolution to identify subtle features over narrow wavelength ranges. An anomalous zone of jarosite cement within the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone in southern Utah was identified with airborne hyperspectral data. To date no other locations of sulfate-rich cements such as this have been documented in the Navajo Sandstone. Here, we use multiple spectral analysis techniques over a micro to macro spatial continuum in order to focus our evaluation on the distribution and relative abundance of jarosite in this area. In this study, imaging spectroscopy is used to help determine the extent of the distribution of jarosite [KFe3(SO4)(2)(OH)(6)], at "Mollie's Nipple" (MN), a significant geomorphic landmark located within the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, in the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone of south central Utah. The extent of the jarosite across the butte is identified in this study by mapping two diagnostic absorption features, referred to as the similar to 2.26 mu m and near-infrared ferric iron absorption features (similar to 0.70-1.15 mu m), independently. This analysis shows that there is a single circular zone of abundant jarosite similar to 1 km in diameter that includes both in-situ and weathered out accumulations. Jarosite formation requires acidic and sulfate-rich fluids, which are unusual for the Navajo Sandstone. Imaging and field spectroscopy provides the spectral resolution needed to map and analyze the mineralogic characteristics of this area; characteristics that may help constrain the conditions under which this atypical butte formed.

AB An extensive in situ data set in the Bohai Sea of China was collected to assess radiometric properties and concentrations of ocean constituents derived from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). The data collected include spectral normalized water-leaving radiance L-wn(lambda) and concentrations of suspended particulate matter-(SPM) and chlorophyll a (Chl-a). A strict spatio-temporal match-up method was adopted in view of the complexity and variability of the turbid coastal area, resulting in 13, 48 and 18 match-ups for MERIS L-wn(lambda), SPM and Chl-a estimates, respectively. For MERIS L-wn(lambda), the match-ups showed mean absolute percentage differences (APD) of 17%-20% in the 412, 443, 620 and 665 nm bands, whereas L-wn(lambda) at bands from 490 and 560 nm had better APD of 15-16%. The band ratio of L-wn(490) to L-wn(560) of the satellite data was in good agreement with in situ observations with an APD of 4%. MERIS SPM and Chl-a products overestimated the in situ values, with the APD of approximately 50% and 60%, respectively. When match-up criteria were relaxed, the assessment results degraded systematically. Hence, in turbid coastal areas where temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity of bio-optical properties may be pronounced as the result of terrestrial influences and local dynamics, the strict spatio-temporal match-up is recommended.

AB Spatially and temporally explicit knowledge of biomass dynamics at broad scales is critical to understanding how forest disturbance and regrowth processes influence carbon dynamics. We modeled live, aboveground tree biomass using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field data and applied the models to 20+ year time-series of Landsat satellite imagery to derive trajectories of aboveground forest biomass for study locations in Arizona and Minnesota. We compared three statistical techniques (Reduced Major Axis regression, Gradient Nearest Neighbor imputation, and Random Forests regression trees) for modeling biomass to better understand how the choice of model type affected predictions of biomass dynamics. Models from each technique were applied across the 20+ year Landsat time-series to derive biomass trajectories, to which a curve-fitting algorithm was applied to leverage the temporal information contained within the time-series itself and to minimize error associated with exogenous effects such as biomass measurements, phenology, sun angle, and other sources. The effect of curve-fitting was an improvement in predictions of biomass change when validated against observed biomass change from repeat FIA inventories. Maps of biomass dynamics were integrated with maps depicting the location and timing of forest disturbance and regrowth to assess the biomass consequences of these processes over large areas and long time frames. The application of these techniques to a large sample of Landsat scenes across North America will facilitate spatial and temporal estimation of biomass dynamics associated with forest disturbance and regrowth, and aid in national-level estimates of biomass change in support of the North American Carbon Program.

AB A new vegetation index, the Normalized Hotspot-signature Vegetation Index (NHVI), is proposed for a better quantitative estimation of leaf area index (LAI) than with the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), especially in the boreal forest. To obtain this new index, the Hotspot-Dark-spot index (HDS) (Lacaze et al., 2002) was introduced. HIDS is calculated by the difference between the strongest vector (hotspot) and the weakest vector (dark-spot) of bi-directional reflectance, a given tract of vegetation returns in the reflecting solar position, and the geometric structure of the vegetation canopy, which are poorly represented by NDVI alone. The validity of NHVI was statistically tested using two field data sets of multi-angular observations and LAI from the boreal forests of Canada; one set was our own observations, and the other was from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). The range of linear correspondence of NHVI with LAI is much wider than that of NDVI alone, indicating significant representation of leaf biomass in the canopy geometry captured by HIDS. With the technical innovation of multi-angular remote-sensing and kernel-driven models in the future, this index has the potential to provide a more accurate evaluation of regional and global LAIs.

AB The validation of aerosol products derived from ocean color missions is required for the assessment of their uncertainties and as a diagnostic for the atmospheric correction schemes used for determining the ocean apparent optical properties. A comprehensive validation of the aerosol products obtained from the ocean color missions SeaWiFS and MODIS is presented; it relies on the field observations collected at 85 AERONET sites and is completed by preliminary results obtained with the data of the maritime AERONET component. A robust match-up selection protocol yields approximately 7000 match-ups for each sensor. The median absolute relative difference for the aerosol optical thickness tau(a) increases from 20-22% at 443 nm to 45-48% in the near-infrared. The validation statistics are comparable for both sensors but MODIS results appear degraded particularly for sites located on isolated islands. The median absolute difference is approximately 0.03 at all wavelengths. Results are further analyzed for specific geographic regions or groups of sites selected to represent oceanic, continental, or desert dust conditions. Importantly, the match-up sets appear generally representative of the regional natural variability in tau(a) amplitude and spectral shape, with the notable exception of high tau(a) conditions that are excluded. An important finding is the underestimate by the atmospheric correction of the Angstrom exponent alpha with a median bias of -0.52. This underestimate is apparent even at low alpha values and regularly increases with alpha. This discrepancy in tau(a) spectral shape might result from an inappropriate set of candidate aerosol models and/or uncertainties in the calibration at the near-infrared bands. As the validation data base is expanded and updated in relation to new versions of the processing chains, this work provides a benchmark for the assessment of the aerosol products derived from the SeaWiFS and MODIS ocean color missions.

AB We report on a glacier inventory for the Canadian Cordillera south of 60 degrees N, across the two western provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, containing similar to 30.000 km(2) of glacierized terrain. Our semi-automated method extracted glacier extents from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes for 2005 and 2000 using a band ratio (TM3/TM5). We compared these extents with glacier cover for the mid-1980s from high-altitude, aerial photography for British Columbia and from Landsat TM imagery for Alberta. A 25 m digital elevation model (DEM) helped to identify debris-covered ice and to split the glaciers into their respective drainage basins. The estimated mapping errors are 3-4% and arise primarily from seasonal snow cover. Glaciers in British Columbia and Alberta respectively lost - 10.8 +/- 3.8% and - 25.4% +/- 4.1% of their area over the period 1985-2005. The region-wide annual shrinkage rate of - 0.55% a(-1) is comparable to rates reported for other mountain ranges in the late twentieth century. Least glacierized mountain ranges with smaller glaciers lost the largest fraction of ice cover: the highest relative ice loss in British Columbia (-24.0 +/- 4.6%) occurred in the northern Interior Ranges, while glaciers in the northern Coast Mountains declined least (- 7.7 +/- 3.4%).

AB Measurements of thermal infrared (TIR) directional anisotropy (difference between off-nadir and nadir brightness temperatures) performed over the city of Toulouse using a method based on the use of 2 airbome TIR cameras are presented. Results from 3 flights at different times during a summer day (July 15th 2004) and from I flight in winter (February 25th 2005) all confirm important anisotropy (up to 10 degrees C) and hot spot effects as previously reported in literature. A simple simulation approach is then proposed. It is based on the aggregation in any viewing direction of 6 directional temperatures (sunlit/shaded walls/streets/roofs) weighted by their corresponding surface ratios within the scene viewed. The city is described by 18 canyon streets oriented in all directions by 10 degrees steps and the 6 temperatures are determined by integrating simulations of the energy balance model SOLENE repeated for the 18 canyon streets. The surface ratios are computed from images of the studied area generated with the POV-Ray software (Persistence of Vison Raytracer, http://www.povray.org/). This method is described in detail. The modelled anisotropy compares favourably with the measurements on all dates, despite a systematic underestimation ranging between 15 and 30%. The possible sources of discrepancy including sensitivity to the aspect ratio and to the surface parameters and possible impact of microscale structures are briefly discussed and several improvements of the modelling system are suggested.

AB Two common approaches to estimate the area of land cover or land-cover change are to use a confusion matrix to adjust the area derived from pixel counting and to use a survey sampling regression estimator that takes advantage of auxiliary variables to improve the precision of the estimated area. These two seemingly divergent approaches to area estimation are encompassed within the general framework of model-assisted estimation. The theory and methods of model-assisted estimation can be applied to expand the options for area estimators and to extend these estimators to sampling designs beyond those currently in use. The objectives of area estimation and map accuracy assessment can be addressed by the same sample data. This suggests the need for research to identify or develop sampling designs that effectively and efficiently achieve this dual-purpose use of these data. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Mapping urban areas at regional and global scales has become an urgent task because of the increasing pressures from rapid urbanization and associated environmental problems. Satellite imaging of stable anthropogenic lights from DMSP-OLS provides an accurate, economical, and straightforward way to map the global distribution of urban areas. To address problems in the thresholding methods that use empirical strategies or manual trial-and-error procedures, we proposed a support vector machine (SVM)-based region-growing algorithm to semi-automatically extract urban areas from DMSP-OLS and SPOT NDVI data. Several simple criteria were used to select SVM training sets of urban and non-urban pixels, and an iterative classification and training procedure was adopted to identify the urban pixels through region growing. The new method was validated using the extents of 25 Chinese cities, as classified by Landsat ETM + images, and then compared with two common thresholding methods. The results showed that the SVM-based algorithm could not only achieve comparable results to the local-optimized threshold method, but also avoid its tedious trial-and-error procedure, suggesting that the new method is an easy and simple alternative for extracting urban extent from DMSP-OLS and SPOT NDVI data.

AB Concentrations of the phytoplankton pigment chlorophyll-a (C-a) provide indicators of nutrient over-enrichment that has negatively affected Chesapeake Bay, U.S.A. C-a time-series from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer aboard the Aqua spacecraft (MODIS-Aqua) provide observations on temporal and spatial scales that far exceed current field and aircraft sampling strategies. These sensors provide consistent, frequent, and high density data to potentially complement ongoing Bay monitoring activities. We used the in situ Water Quality Monitoring Data set of the Chesapeake Bay Program to evaluate decade-long time-series of SeaWiFS and MCDIS-Aqua C-a retrievals in the Bay. The accuracy of the retrievals generally degraded with increasing latitude as the optical complexity increases northward. C-a derived using empirical ("band ratio") algorithms overestimated in situ measurements by 10-50 and 40-100% for SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua, respectively, but with limited variability. C-a derived using spectral-matching algorithms showed less bias for both sensors, but with significant variability and sensitivity to radiometric errors. Regionally-tuned empirical algorithms performed best throughout the Bay, offering a combination of reasonable accuracy and high spatial coverage. The radiometric spectral resolution used as input to the algorithms strongly influenced the quality of C-a retrievals from both sensors. These results establish a baseline quantification of algorithm and sensor performance in a variable and stressed ecosystem against which novel approaches might be compared. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Results from several previously published algorithms for wet snow detection in Antarctica from K-band spaceborne brightness temperature are compared and evaluated vs. estimates of wet snow conditions from ground measurements. In addition, a new physically-driven algorithm, in which the detectable liquid water content is assumed constant, is proposed and assessed. All algorithms are also evaluated by analyzing their results during collapses of ice shelves. Two algorithms are selected for deriving updated trends of melting index (MI, the number of melting days times the area subject to melting) between 1979 and 2008 over the whole Antarctica and at sub-continental scales. In the first algorithm wet snow is identified when brightness temperature exceeds the mean of winter brightness temperature plus 30 K and the second is the new model-based approach described here. Both negative and positive MI trends are obtained, depending on the algorithm used. A high number of melting days (up to 100 days) are detected over the Wilkins ice shelf, the Peninsula and the George VI ice shelf. Over East Antarctica, the West and Amery ice shelves are subject to melting for a maximum of approximately 50 days. Positive trends of number of melting days are detected over most of the West Antarctica, with peak values up to 1.2 days/year over the Larsen C ice shelf, 1.8 days/ year over the George VI ice shelf and 0.55 days/year over the Wilkins ice shelf area. The correlation between MI values and December-January (DJ) averaged air/surface temperature over selected locations show values ranging between similar to 0.8 and similar to 0.4. Results suggest that a 1 degrees C increase in the monthly averaged DJ air/surface temperature corresponds to an average MI increase of approximately 2.10(6) x km(2) x day. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB Biophysical and above-water reflectance measurements collected in 2006 were used to evaluate the OC3M, standard GSM01, and a modified version of the GSM01 algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a (chl) concentrations in the Strait of Georgia, located off the southwest coast of Canada. The Strait was generally a case 2 water body, transitioning from chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dominant in the central region to possibly particulate dominant in Fraser River plume regions. Results showed that the OC3M algorithm was somewhat effective (R-2=0.550) outside the most turbid areas of the Fraser River plume. However, a systematic overestimation of lower chl concentrations was found, which may have been related to the higher CDOM absorption observed throughout the Strait. The standard GSM01 algorithm had moderately good agreement with measured CDOM absorption (R-2=0.593) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations (R-2=0.888), but was ineffective at estimating chl concentrations. Localized characterization of the CDOM absorption, through a hyperbolic CDOM model, improved the modified GSM01 results with slightly better agreement with measure CDOM absorption (R-2=0.614) and TSS concentrations (R-2=0.933). When the modified GSM01 algorithm was limited to regions with lower combined CDOM and non-algal particulate absorption (a(dg) (443)< 0.7 m(-1)), it was more effective then the OC3M algorithm at estimating chl concentrations. This suggests that a threshold value on the a(dg) (443) or b(bp) (443) estimated by the GSM01 algorithm may be beneficial for limiting turbidity influence on the algorithm. The further reinterpretation of phytoplankton absorption from the modified GSM01 algorithm with a two-component phytoplankton model resulted in a chl relationship with an R-2=0.677 and a linear slope closer to one.

AB Sea ice thickness is a crucial, but very undersampled cryospheric parameter of fundamental importance for climate modeling. Advances in satellite altimetry have enabled the measurement of sea ice freeboard using satellite microwave altimeters. Unfortunately, validation of these new techniques has suffered from a lack of ground truth measurements. Therefore, an airborne campaign was carried out in March 2006 using laser altimetry and photo imagery to validate sea ice elevation measurements derived from the Envisat/RA-2 microwave altimeter.
   We present a comparative analysis of Envisat/RA-2 sea ice elevation processing with collocated airborne measurements collected north of the Canadian Archipelago. Consistent overall relationships between block-averaged airborne laser and Envisat elevations are found, over both leads and floes, along the full 1300 km aircraft track. The fine resolution of the airborne laser altimeter data is exploited to evaluate elevation variability within the RA-2 ground footprint. Our analysis shows good agreement between RA-2 derived sea ice elevations and those measured by airborne laser altimetry, particularly over refrozen leads where the overall mean difference is about I cm. Notwithstanding this small 1 cm mean difference. we identify a larger elevation uncertainty (of order 10 cm) associated with the uncertain location of dominant radar targets within the particular RA-2 footprint. Sources of measurement uncertainty or ambiguity are identified, and include snow accumulation, tracking noise, and the limited coverage of airborne measurements. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In this paper we investigate the relative predictive power of a number of remote sensing-derived environmental descriptors of land cover and productivity to predict species richness of breeding birds in Ontario, Canada. Specifically, we first developed a suite of environmental descriptors (productivity, land cover, and elevation). These descriptors were based on readily available data, including the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and terrain data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). We then assessed the capacity of the environmental descriptors, using a decision tree approach, to estimate species richness of all breeding birds, and of groups of bird species based on habitat and nesting groupings, using data summarized from the Ontario Breeding Bird Atlas. Results indicated that the variance in the distributions of total bird species richness, as well as richness of habitat and nesting groups, were well predicted by the environmental descriptors (with variance explained ranging between 47 and 75%) with the predictions clearly related to both habitat (as modeled by land cover and land cover diversity) and vegetation productivity. Modeling demonstrates that initial partitioning is most often based on land cover class, indicating that it may be the driving variable of bird species richness; however, information on vegetation productivity and energy were then critical in defining how many species occur in each habitat type. The results indicate that remotely sensed environmental descriptors can provide an effective tool for predicting breeding bird species richness at regional scales. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB For thirty years, simple crop water balance models have been used by the early warning community to monitor agricultural drought. These models estimate and accumulate actual crop evapotranspiration, evaluating environmental conditions based on crop water requirements. Unlike seasonal rainfall totals, these models take into account the phenology of the crop, emphasizing conditions during the peak grain filling phase of crop growth. In this paper we describe an analogous metric of crop performance based on time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery. A special temporal filter is used to screen for cloud contamination. Regional NDVI time series are then composited for cultivated areas, and adjusted temporally according to the timing of the rainy season. This adjustment standardizes the NDVI response vis-A-vis the expected phenological response of maize. A national time series index is then created by taking the cropped-area weighted average of the regional series. This national time series provides an effective summary of vegetation response in agricultural areas, and allows for the identification of NDVI green-up during grain filling. Onset-adjusted NDVI values following the grain filling period are well correlated with U.S. Department of Agriculture production figures, possess desirable linear characteristics, and perform better than more common indices such as maximum seasonal NDVI or seasonally averaged NDVI. Thus, just as appropriately calibrated crop water balance models can provide more information than seasonal rainfall totals, the appropriate agro-phenological filtering of NDVI can improve the utility and accuracy of space-based agricultural monitoring.

AB Researchers in lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) strive to search for the most appropriate laser-based metrics as predictors in regression models for estimating forest structural variables. Many previously developed models are scale-dependent that need to be fitted and then applied both at the same scale or pixel size. The objective of this paper is to develop methods for scale-invariant estimation of forest biomass using lidar data. We proposed two scale-invariant models for biomass: a linear functional model and an equivalent nonlinear model that use lidar-derived canopy height distributions (CHD) and canopy height quantile functions (CHQ) as predictors, respectively. The two models are called functional regression models because the predictors CHD and CHQ are themselves functions or functional data. The model formulation was justified mathematically under moderate assumptions. We also created a fine-resolution biomass map by mapping individual tree component biomass in a temperate forest of eastern Texas with a lidar tree-delineation approach. The map was used as reference data to synthesize training and test datasets at multiple scales for validating the two scale-invariant models. Results suggest that the models can accurately predict biomass and yield consistent predictive performances across a variety of scales with an R-2 ranging from 0.80 to 0.95 (RMSE: from 14.3 Mg/ha to 33.7 Mg/ha) among all the fitted models. Results also show that a training data size of around 50 plots or less was enough to guarantee a good fitting of the linear functional model. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of CHD and CHQ as lidar metrics for estimating biomass as well as the capability of lidar for mapping biomass at a range of scales. The functional regression models of this study are useful for lidar-based forest inventory tasks where the analysis units vary in size and shape. They also hold promise for estimating other forest characteristics such as below-ground biomass, timber volume, crown fuel weight, and Leaf Area Index. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations and 'water-leaving' reflectance were assessed along transects in Keweenaw Bay (Lake Superior) and in Green Bay (Lake Michigan) (two of the Laurentian Great Lakes, USA), featuring oligotrophic (0.4-0.8 mg Chla m(-3)) and eutrophic to hyper-eutrophic waters (11-131 mg Chla m(-3)), respectively. A red-to-NIR band Chla retrieval algorithm proved to be applicable to Green Bay, but gave mostly negative values for Keweenaw Bay. An alternative algorithm could be based on Chla fluorescence, which in Keweenaw Bay was indicated by enhanced reflectance near 680 rum. Bands 7, 8 and 9 of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) have been specifically designed to detect phytoplankton fluorescence in coastal waters. A quite strong linear relationship was found between Chla concentration and fluorescence line height (FLH) computed with these MERIS bands. The same relationship held for observations on oligotrophic waters elsewhere, but not for Green Bay, where the FLH diminished to become negative as Chla increased. The remote sensing application of the algorithms could be tested because a MERIS scene was acquired coinciding with the day of the field observations in Keweenaw Bay and one day after those in Green Bay. For Green Bay the pixel values from the red-to-NIR band algorithm compared well to the steep Chla gradient in situ. This result is very positive from the perspective of satellite use in monitoring eutrophic inland and coastal waters in many parts of the world. Implementation of the FLH relationship in the scene of Keweenaw Bay produced highly variable pixel values. The FLH in oligotrophic inland waters like Lake Superior appears to be very close to or below the MERIS detection limit. An empirical algorithm incorporating three MERIS bands in the blue-to-green spectral region might be used as an alternative, but its applicability to other regions and seasons remains to be verified. Moreover, none of the algorithms will be Suitable for mesotrophic water bodies. The results indicate that Chla mapping in oligotrophic and mesotrophic areas of the Great Lakes remains problematic for the current generation of satellite sensors. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Nuisance blue-green algal blooms contribute to aesthetic degradation of water resources by means of accelerated eutrophication, taste and odor problems, and the production of toxins that can have serious adverse human health effects. Current field-based methods for detecting blooms are costly and time consuming, delaying management decisions. Methods have been developed for estimating phycocyanin concentration, the accessory pigment unique to freshwater blue-green algae, in productive inland water. By employing the known optical properties of phycocyanin, researchers have evaluated the utility of field-collected spectral response patterns for determining concentrations of phycocyanin pigments and ultimately blue-green algal abundance. The purpose of this research was to evaluate field spectroscopy as a rapid cyanobacteria bloom assessment method. In-situ field reflectance spectra were collected at 54 sampling sites on two turbid reservoirs on September 6th and 7th in Indianapolis, Indiana using ASD Fieldspec (UV/VNIR) spectroradiometers. Surface water samples were analyzed for in-vitro pigment concentrations and other physical and chemical water quality parameters. Semi-empirical algorithms by Simis et al. [Simis, S., Peters, S., Gons, H. (2005). Remote sensing of the cyanobacterial pigment phycocyanin in turbid inland water. American Society of Limnology and Oceanography 50(11): 237-245] were applied to the field spectra to predict chlorophyll a and phycocyanin absorption at 665 nm and 620 nm, respectively. For estimation of phycocyanin concentration, a specific absorption coefficient of 0.0070 m(2) mg PC-1 for phycocyanin at 620 nm, a(PC)* (620), was employed, yielding an r(2) value of 0.85 (n=48, p<0.0001), mean relative residual value of 0.51 (sigma=1.41) and root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.54 ppb. Results suggest this algorithm could be a robust model for estimating phycocyanin. Error is highest in water with phycocyanin concentrations of less than 10 ppb and where phycocyanin abundance is low relative to chlorophyll a. A strong correlation between measured phycocyanin concentrations and biovolume measurements of cyanobacteria was also observed (r=0.89), while a weaker relationship (r=0.66) resulted between chlorophyll a concentration and cyanobacterial biovolume.

AB Forest types differ in their hyperspectral anisotropy patterns mainly due to species-specific geometrical structure, spatial arrangement of canopies and subsequent shadow patterns. This paper examines the multi-angular, hyperspectral reflectance properties of typical hemiboreal forests during summer time using three simultaneous CHRIS PROBA (mode 3) scenes and stand inventory data from the Jarvselja Training and Experimental Forestry District in southeastern Estonia. We investigated the magnitude and reasons for the differences in the anisotropy patterns of deciduous and coniferous stands at three backward viewing angles. A forest reflectance model (FRT) was used as a tool to provide a theoretical basis to the discussion, and to estimate the directional contribution of scattering from crowns and ground to total stand reflectance for the two forest types. The FRT model simulated successfully the HDRF (hemispherical-directional reflectance factor) curves of the study stands to match those obtained from the CHRIS image, yet it produced a smaller and less wavelength-dependent angular reflectance effect than was observed in the satellite image. The main results of this study provide new information for separating the spectral contribution of the forest floor (or understory layer) from the tree canopy layer: (1) the red edge domain was identified to have the largest contribution from forest understory, and (2) the more oblique the viewing angle, the smaller the contribution from the understory. In addition, coniferous stands were observed to have a specific angular effect at the red and red edge domain, possibly as a result of the hierarchical structure and arrangement of coniferous canopies.

AB Mangrove forests are found within the intertropical zone and are one of the most biodiverse and productive wetlands on Earth. We focus oil the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta (CGSM) in Colombia, the largest coastal lagoon-delta ecosystem in the Caribbean area with an extension of 1280 kin 2, where one of the largest mangrove rehabilitation projects in Latin America is currently underway. Extensive man-made hydrological modifications in the region caused hypersaline soil (>90 g kg(-1)) conditions since the 1960s triggering a large dieback of mangrove wetlands (similar to 247 km(2)). In this paper, we describe a new systematic methodology to measure mangrove height and aboveground biomass by remote sensing. The method is based on SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) elevation data, ICEsat/GLAS waveforms (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) and field data. Since the locations of the ICEsat and field datasets do not coincide, they are used independently to calibrate SRTM elevation and produce a map of mangrove canopy height. We compared height estimation methods based on waveform centroids and the canopy height profile (CHP). Linear relationships between ICEsat height estimates and SRTM elevation were derived. We found the centroid of the canopy waveform contribution (CWC) to be the best height estimator. The field data was used to estimate a SRTM canopy height bias (-1.3 m) and estimation error (rms = 1.9 m). The relationship was applied to the SRTM elevation data to produce a mangrove canopy height map. Finally, we used field data and published allometric equations to derive an empirical relationship between canopy height and biomass. This relationship was used to scale the mangrove height map and estimate aboveground biomass distribution for the entire CGSM. The mean mangrove canopy height in CGSM is 7.7 m and most of the biomass is concentrated in forests around 9 m in height. Our biomass maps will enable estimation of regeneration rates of mangrove forests under hydrological rehabilitation at large spatial scales over the next decades. They will also be used to assess how highly disturbed mangrove forests respond to increasing sea level rise under current global climate change scenarios. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A method for haze reduction in the visible bands of Landsat TM and ETM+ images over a shallow water marine environment is presented in this paper. This method uses the near infrared (NIR) band to estimate the spatial distribution of haze intensity in each visible band through a linear regression model established over deep water areas. As a first order approximation, the signal received at the sensor is assumed to be the arithmetic sum of radiance contributed by haze and the radiance leaving the water surface. Reduction of haze is then carried out by a simple subtraction procedure. Images acquired over the Southern Tip of Palawan, Philippines are used for the experiments. Results show that the method works well for compensating signals contaminated by optically thin haze. Overcorrection occurs when haze is optically thick and geometrically complex. When images are acquired under hazy conditions the method can be applied to drastically improve image interpretability and may also be considered as a necessary pre-processing step for subsequent analyses and information extraction.

AB We have developed an automatic method to monitor the AVHRR instrument sensitivity over time in the short-wave reflective channels to ensure that trends in the data series obtained by this instrument are real and not sensor artefacts. Our radiometric calibration method uses the Multivariate Alteration Detection (MAD) algorithm to statistically select invariant features over land areas from multiple image-pairs that are compared to assess changes in the instrument's calibration. This method requires no a priori regional knowledge and is globally applicable. A calibrated time series from Pseudo-Invariant Features located in central Australia are shown to have long-term trends removed. The resulting MAD-based calibration has a root mean squared error of similar to 5-6% for both channels 1 and 2 and is in alignment with other approaches.

AB An object-based approach to generating shrub cover change maps of potential use for monitoring shrubland habitat reserves was developed and tested. A high fidelity, bi-temporal airborne image data set was generated through frame-based image acquisition, precise image-to-image registration, radiometric normalization, and selection of near-anniversary image acquisition dates with similar precipitation conditions prior to both image acquisitions. Image segmentation and classification processes were applied to the bi-temporal layer stack of very high spatial resolution visible and near infrared (V/NIR) image data, such that shrub change objects were delineated and identified directly.
   Image segments derived from the bi-temporal V/NIR image data set having I in spatial resolution delineated most shrub change features in a qualitatively realistic manner. A Standard Nearest Neighbor classifier with segment mean and standard deviation measures of Red, NIR, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image features yielded the shrub change map that agreed more closely with reference data than the classifier based on fuzzy membership functions. The overall accuracy and kappa statistics for the optimal shrub change map were 0.83 and 0.64, respectively, with the predominant error being associated with "over-classification" of no-change objects as some type of shrub change. No statistical difference in accuracies of three- and five-class maps was found, suggesting that changes in true shrubs and sub-shrubs within coastal sage scrub vegetation communities can be differentiated reliably. A net 5% loss of shrub cover was determined for the 1998-2005 period from the shrub change map of the study area. The greatest decrease and net loss of shrub cover occurred within the urban edge zone and within flat-lying areas. Patterns of shrub loss appear to be more related to anthropogenic disturbance than effects of the severe seven-year drought that occurred between image acquisition dates. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB A data-based resampling experiment is performed to estimate sampling errors of area-averaged soil moisture estimates due to spatial sampling by ground-based sensors. The data consists of high-resolution soil moisture images derived from the Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR/CX) sensor flown on an aircraft as part of the summer field experiment (SMEX04 - Soil Moisture Experiment 2004) in the monsoon region of Sonora, Mexico. The sampling characteristics are investigated by accounting for random networks and evenly spaced networks. For random network designs, we develop a simple model that can be used to estimate the sampling uncertainty (expressed as standard deviation of sampling error as a percentage of the areal mean soil moisture) as a function of the number of sensors, mean soil moisture content and averaging area. This model is valid for five or more sensors. The model should prove useful to those wishing to assess the area-averaged performance of a soil moisture network. Furthermore, the method of analysis is applicable to other study regions (Oklahoma, Iowa, Alabama, Georgia, and Arizona) where soil moisture fields have been mapped at high resolution using airborne passive microwave remote sensors.

AB Airborne laser scanner systems provide detailed forest information that can be used for important improvements in forest management decisions. Planning systems under development use plot-survey data to represent forest stands in large forest holdings which enables new flexible methods to model the forest and optimize selection of silvicultural treatments. In Sweden today, only averages of forest stand variables are used, and the survey methods used do not provide plot-survey data for all stands in large forest holdings. This is a task possibly solved using airborne laser scanner data. Various measures can be derived from laser data, each describing different forest variables, such as tree height distribution, vegetation density and vertical tree crown structure. Here, imputation of field plot (10 m radius) data using measures derived from airborne laser scanner data (TopEye) and optical image data (SPOT 5 HRG satellite sensor) were evaluated as a method to provide data for new long-term management planning systems. In addition to commonly applied measures, the semivariogram of laser measurements was evaluated as a new measure to extract spatial characteristics of the forest. The study used data from 870, 10 in radius field plots (0 to 812 m(3) ha(-1)) surveyed for a 1200 ha large forest estate in the south of Sweden. At the best, combining measures derived from laser scanner data and SPOT 5 data, stand mean volume was estimated with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 20% of the sample mean and stem density with 22% RMSE. Bias of stein density estimates was 5%, and stand stem volume 4%. Although these accuracies are sufficient for operational application, estimates of tree species proportions and within-stand variation were clearly not. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For testing the integration of the remote sensing related technologies into the water quality monitoring programs of Lake Garda (the largest Italian lake), the spatial and spectral resolutions of Hyperion and the capability of physics-based approaches were considered highly suitable. Hyperion data were acquired on 22nd July 2003 and water quality was assessed (i) defining a bio-optical model, (ii) converting the Hyperion atsensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectances, and (iii) adopting a bio-optical model inversion technique. The bio-optical model was parameterised using specific inherent optical properties of the lake and light field variables derived from a radiative transfer numerical model. A MODTRAN-based atmospheric correction code, complemented with an air/water interface correction was used to convert Hyperion at-sensor radiances into subsurface irradiance reflectance values. These reflectance values were comparable to in situ reflectance spectra measured during the Hyperion overpass, except at longer wavelengths (beyond 700 nm), where reflectance values were contaminated by severe atmospheric adjacency effects. Chlorophyll-a and tripton concentrations were retrieved by inverting two Hyperion bands selected using a sensitivity analysis applied to the bio-optical model. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the assessment of coloured dissolved organic matter was not achievable in this study due to the limited coloured dissolved organic matter concentration range of the lake, resulting in reflectance differences below the environmental measurement noise of Hyperion. The chlorophyll-a and tripton image-products were compared to in situ data collected during the Hyperion overpass, both by traditional sampling techniques (8 points) and by continuous flow-through systems (32 km). For chlorophyll-a the correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-inferred concentrations was 0.77 (data range from 1.30 to 2.16 mg m(-3)). The Hyperion-derived chlorophyll-a concentrations also match most of the flow-through transect data. For tripton, the validation was constrained by variable re-suspension phenomena. The correlation coefficient between in situ point stations and Hyperion-derived concentrations increased from 0.48 to 0.75 (data range from 0.95 to 2.13 g m(-3)) if the sampling data from the re-suspension zone was avoided. The comparison of Hyperionderived tripton concentrations and flow-through transect data exhibited a similar mismatch. The results of this research suggest further studies to address compatibilities of validation methods for water body features with a high rate of change, and to reduce the contamination by atmospheric adjacency effects on Hyperion data at longer wavelengths in Alpine environment. The transferability of the presented method to other sensors and the ability to assess water quality independent from in situ water quality data, suggest that management relevant applications for Lake Garda (and other subalpine lakes) could be supported by remote sensing.

AB Exotic plant invasion is a major environmental and ecological concern and is a particular issue for Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Early detection of invasive plants is crucial for effective weed management. Several studies have explored hyperspectral imagery for mapping invasive plants with promising results. However, only a few extensive or comparative 'studies about image processing techniques for invasive plant detection have been reported, and even fewer studies have involved very high spatial and spectral resolution imagery. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the utility of very high spatial (0.5 m) and spectral (4 nm) resolution imagery and several classification approaches for detecting tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) infestations, the most problematic invasive plant species in the riparian habitats of southern California.
   Hierarchical clustering was a particularly effective and efficient statistical method for identifying wavebands and spectral transforms having the greatest discriminatory power. Products resulting from the classification of airborne hyperspectral image data varied by scene, input data type, classifier, and minimum patch size. Overall accuracy of image classification accuracy of products co-varied with commission error rates, such that products having strong agreement with reference data also had a high number of false detections. Integrating the findings from qualitative map analysis, areal proportion statistics, and object-based accuracy assessment indicates that the parallelepiped classifier with several narrow wavebands selected through hierarchical clustering yielded the most accurate and reliable tamarisk classification products.

AB A new set of recently developed leaf area index (LAI) algorithms has been employed for producing a global LAI dataset at 1 km resolution and in time-steps of 10 days, using data from the Satellite pour l'observation de la terre (SPOT) VEGETATION (VGT) sensor. In this paper, this new LAI product is compared with the global MODIS Collection 4 LAI product over four validation sites in North America. The accuracy of both LAI products is assessed against seven high resolution ETM+ LAI maps derived from field measurements in 2000, 2001, and 2003. Both products were closely matched outside growing season. The MODIS product tended to be more variable than the VGT product during the summer period when the LAI was maximum. VGT and ETM+ LAI maps agreed well at three out of the four sites. The median relative absolute error of the VGT LAI product varied from 24% to 75% at I km scale and it ranged from 34% to 88% for the MODIS LAI product. The importance of correcting field measurements for the clumping effect is illustrated at the deciduous broadleaf forest site (HARV). Inclusion of the sub-pixel land cover information improved the quality of LAI estimates for the prairie grassland KONZ site. Further improvement of the global VGT LAI product is suggested by production and inclusion of pixel-specific global foliage clumping index and forest background reflectance maps that would serve as an input into the VGT LAI algorithms.

AB Fires in boreal and temperate forests play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. While forest fires in North America (NA) have been surveyed extensively by U.S. and Canadian forest services, most fire records are limited to seasonal statistics without information on temporal evolution and spatial expansion. Such dynamic information is crucial for modeling fire emissions. Using the daily Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data archived from 1989 to 2000, an extensive and consistent fire product was developed across the entire NA forest regions on a daily basis at 1-km resolution. The product was generated following data calibration, geo-referencing, and the application of an active fire detection algorithm and a burned area mapping algorithm. The spatial-temporal variation of forest fire in NA is analyzed in terms of (1) annual and monthly patterns of fire occurrences in different eco-domains, (2) the influence of topographic factors (elevation zones, aspect classes, and slope classes), and (3) major forest types and eco-regions in NA. It was found that 1) among the 12 years analyzed, 1989 and 1995 were the most severe fire years in NA; 2) the majority of burning occurred during June-July and in low elevation zones (<500 m) with gentle slopes (<10 degrees), except in the dry eco-domain where more fires occurred in higher elevation zones (>2000 m); 3) most fires occurred in the polar ecodomain, sub-arctic eco-division, and in the taiga ( boreal forests), forest-tundras and open woodlands eco-provinces in the boreal forests of Canada. The tendency for multiple bums to occur increases with elevation and slope until about 2500 m elevation and 24 degrees slope, and decreases therefore. In comparison with ground observations, the omission and commission errors are on the order of 20%. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports the results of a near-global validation of the SRTM DEM dataset, using a unique database of completely independent height measurements derived from satellite altimeter echoes, primarily gathered by ERS-1. These heights are obtained using a rule-based expert system which identifies each echo as 1 of 11 different characteristic shapes, and selects the optimal retracking algorithm to obtain best range to surface. The results of this comparison, which includes over 54 million altimeter derived heights, show generally very good agreement with the SRTM data, with global statistics for mean difference of 3 m and a standard deviation of 16 in. Quantitative validation results are given for each continent and are summarised here.

AB This article describes the development of a methodology for scaling observations of changes in tropical forest cover to large areas at high temporal frequency from coarse resolution satellite imagery. The approach for estimating proportional forest cover change as a continuous variable is based on a regression model that relates multispectral, multitemporal MODIS data, transformed to optimize the spectral detection of vegetation changes, to reference change data sets derived from a Landsat data record for a study site in Central America. A number of issues involved in model development are addressed here by exploring the spatial, spectral and temporal patterns of forest cover change as manifested in a time-series of multi-scale satellite imagery.
   The analyses highlighted the distinct spectral change patterns from year-to-year in response to the possible land cover trajectories of forest clearing, regeneration and changes in climatic and land cover conditions. Spectral response in the MODIS Calibrated Radiances Swath data set followed more closely with the expected patterns of forest cover change than did the spectral response in the Gridded Surface Reflectance product. With forest cover change patterns relatively invariant to the spatial grain size of the analysis, the model results indicate that the best spectral metrics for detecting tropical forest clearing and regeneration are those that incorporate shortwave infrared information from the MODIS calibrated radiances data set at 500-m resolution, with errors ranging from 7.4 to 10.9% across the time periods of analysis.

AB Three linked leaf and canopy radiative transfer models were used to assess uncertainties in three vegetation architectures for the relationships between canopy water content and Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT). The leaf radiative transfer model PROSPECT was linked to SAILH, rowMCRM, and FLIM canopy reflectance models to generate synthetic spectra for a range of leaf and canopy parameters under closed, row-structured, and forest canopy architectures, respectively. Leaf water content (C-w) and leaf area index (LAI) were used to calculate canopy water content. Leaf and canopy parameters that affect the retrieval of EWT, estimated by the MODTRAN-based fitting technique, were used to investigate their influence on the water content estimates. Results showed a consistent relationship between retrieved EWT and canopy water content for the different simulated architectural scenarios. It was shown that EWT was negatively affected by leaf dry matter and soil background. Retrievals of EWT from hyperspectral Advanced risible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery at three study sites were then used for cross-validation of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data, assessing the behavior of NDVI, EVI, NDWI, and SIWSI as potential indicators of vegetation water content. All four NIODIS indexes showed consistent agreement with retrievals of EWT from AVIRIS imagery at the agricultural site and the savanna-shrub site, with EVI having the highest correlation. However, at the conifer forest study site the two water indexes, NDWI and SIWSI, yielded better agreement with retrievals of EWT than NDVI and EVI. The performance of NDVI was inconsistent across sites. This manuscript demonstrates the importance of canopy architecture when estimating EWT by showing that large errors are obtained when EWT estimates derived from absorption feature curve-fitting are applied to different canopy types. These errors are propagated in simple indexes that produce inconsistent results when applied to divergent vegetation conditions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB A precise simulation of soil water content (SWC) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in a region or a catchment depends on the accuracy of the spatial data inputs. In this study, we developed a simple grid-based soil water balance model. In this model, remotely sensed vegetation data are used to estimate spatial distributions of daily SWC and ETa rates. The model was validated by comparing simulated SWC with the measured by gravimetric method and time domain reflectometry (TDR) at an experimental test site located in Northeastern Germany in the time period 1993-1998. The index of agreement IA and the root-mean-square error obtained from the comparison of the TDR measurements to the simulated values ranged from 0.45 to 0.80 and from 0.029 to 0.061 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The comparison of simulated ETa rates to those measured by four large-scale lysimeters at another test site showed IA values above 0.87 and R-2 values higher than 0.59. For the regional application of the model, a method was developed to integrate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) vegetation data into the model. The MODIS data used in our study consist of 16-day normalized difference vegetation index and 8-day leaf area index products. Regarding the spatial application of the model, our approach was tested in a catchment located in Northeastern Germany in 2001-2003. A sufficient correlation between daily discharge rates measured at two observation gauges in the catchment and the corresponding simulated discharge rates and also good correlations between the simulated ETa rates and the MODIS-leaf area index values indicate that the model is an appropriate simulation tool at regional scale if the corresponding additional spatial databases regarding surface and soil properties are available.

AB Climate change is predicted to alter the canopy phenology of temperate and boreal forests, which will affect carbon, water, and energy budgets. Therefore, there is a great need to evaluate remotely sensed products for their potential to accurately capture canopy dynamics. The objective of this study was to compare several products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to field measurements of fraction photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) and plant area index (PAI) for a deciduous broadleaf forest in northern Wisconsin in 2002. MODIS products captured the general phenological development of the canopy although MODIS products overestimated the leaf area during the overstory leaf out period. Field data suggest that the period from budburst to canopy maturity, or maximum PAI, occurred in 10 to 12 days while MODIS products predicted onset of greenness and maturity from 1 to 21 days and 0 to 19 days earlier than that from field observations, respectively. Temporal compositing of MODI S data and understory development are likely key factors explaining differences with field data. Maximum PAI estimates differed only by 7% between field derived and MODIS-based estimates of LAI. Implications for ecosystem modeling of carbon and water exchange and future research needs are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The local-scale spatial distribution of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), absorbed PAR (APAR) and net all-wave radiation (Q*) across the top of a forest canopy was investigated as a function of topography, sky,conditions and forest heterogeneity for a forested hilly study site located in south-central Indiana, USA that is part of the FLUX-NET and SpecNet networks. The method to estimate spatial variability of radiation components utilized theoretical radiation modeling applied to a topographic model combined with spatial distribution of leaf area index derived from IKONOS imagery and empirical models derived from data collected on a single flux tower. Modeled PAR and Q* compared consistently well with observations from a single tower with differences typically less than 10%, although clear-sky conditions were simulated more accurately than cloudy conditions. Spatial variability of radiation was found to be very sensitive to topographic relief and could be scaled linearly by mean slope angle. Decreases in optical transmissivity and increases in cloudiness had a strong effect of reducing both the spatial average and standard deviation of radiation components. Spatial variability of APAR was 53% greater than PAR and the characteristic scale of variance was reduced due to finer scale and magnitude of variance of LAI. Clear seasonal patterns existed in both spatial average and standard deviation values with summer producing the largest mean values and weakest spatial variability due to smaller solar zenith angles and seasonality in both optical transmissivity (scaled linearly by specific humidity) and cloudiness. These findings of spatial variability illustrate the need to characterize the complex landscape patterns at flux tower sites, particularly where the goal is to relate flux tower data to satellite imagery.

AB An inversion algorithm to retrieve a complete set of aerosol optical and physical properties has been developed. The algorithm is based on sun-photometer measurements with emphasis on polarimetric observations. At present, these polarized sun-photometer observations are mainly provided by PHOTONS network included in AERONET worldwide network. With ground-based measurement of direct sun irradiance, as well as total and polarized sky radiance, most of key characteristics of atmospheric aerosols are retrieved, including spectral single-scattering albedo from UV to NIR wavelength, elements of scattering matrix F-11 and -F-12 (i.e. phase function and polarized phase function), complex refractive index, and size distribution. These parameters are fundamentally valuable in atmospheric physical and chemical studies. The theoretical accuracy is assessed based on three distinct bimodal log-nori-nal aerosol models. The sensitivity studies to measurement uncertainties and to observing geometrical conditions are implemented to estimate the retrieval accuracy. Examples of typical retrievals when applying to real measurements are illustrated and compared with AERONET operational inversions. The particle shape-independent advantage of the retrieved single-scattering albedo, phase function, and polarized phase function is validated by considering a non-spherical aerosol model, which consisted of spheroid particles.

AB The L-band brightness temperature of natural grass fields is strongly influenced by rainfall interception. In wet conditions, the contribution of the soil, mulch, and vegetation to the overall microwave emission is difficult to decouple, thus rendering the retrieval of surface soil moisture from a direct emission model difficult. This paper investigates the development and assesses the performances of statistical regressions linking passive microwave measurements to surface soil moisture in order to assess the potential of soil moisture retrievals over natural grass. First, statistical regressions were analytically derived from the L-Band Emission of the Biosphere model (L-MEB). Single configuration (I angle, I polarisation), and multi-configuration regressions (2 angles, or 2 polarisations) were developed. Second, the performance of statistical regressions was evaluated under different rainfall interception conditions. For that purpose, a modified polatisation ratio at L-band was used to build three data sets with different interception levels. In the presence of interception, a regression based on one observation angle (50 degrees) and two polarisations was able to reduce the effects of vegetation and soil roughness on the soil moisture retrievals. The methodology presented in this study is also able to provide estimates of the vegetation and soil roughness contribution to the brightness temperature. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports oil ranges of carbon dioxide (CO,) activity in biological soil crusts (BSC) correlated with different ranges of the BSC's spectral reflectance throughout the Phenological cycle of the year. Methodology is based oil surface CO2 exchange measurements, ground spectral measurements, and satellite images interpretation. Thirty-nine field campaigns, each of duration of 3 days, were conducted over the Course of 2 years at a sand duties and a loess environment of the northwestern Negev desert in Israel, in order to relate the CO2 fluxes and the spectral signals to the seasonal phenology. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was derived from ground measurements of the BSC's reflectance and correlated with their CO2 exchange data. A linear mixture model, incorporating the different contributions of the sites' ground features, was calculated and compared with SPOT-HRV data. From the ground measurements, fairly good correlations were found between the NDVI and the CO, fluxes oil a seasonal scale. Hence, the NDVI successfully indicates the potential magnitude and capacity of the BSC's assimilation activity. The linear mixture model Successfully describes the phenological cycles of the BSC, annual, and perennial plants and corresponds well to the satellite data. Moreover, the model enables annual changes of the phenology cycle and the growing season length to be distinguished. Both the linear mixture model and the derived NDVI values recorded the recovery of the BSC at the beginning of the wet season before annuals had germinated. Finally, it is concluded that a combination of CO, exchange measurements, linear mixture model, and NDVI values is suitable for monitoring BSC's productivity in and regions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB The current paper describes the development and testing of a procedure which can use widely available remotely sensed and ancillary data to assess large-scale patterns of forest productivity in Italy. To reach this objective a straightforward model (C-Fix) was applied which is based on the relationship between photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by plant canopies and relevant gross primary productivity (GPP). The original C-Fix methodology was improved by using more abundant ancillary information and more efficient techniques for NDVI data processing. In particular, two extraction methods were applied to NDVI data, derived from two sensors (NOAA-AVHRR and SPOT-VGT) to feed C-Fix. The accuracy of the model outputs was assessed through comparison with annual and monthly values of forest GPP derived from eight eddy covariance flux towers. The results obtained indicated the superiority of SPOT-VGT over NOAA-AVHRR data and a higher efficiency of the more advanced NDVI extraction method. Globally, the procedure was proved to be of easy and objective implementation and allowed the evaluation of mean productivity levels of existing forests on the national scale. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Remote sensing of near-surface hydrological conditions within northern peatlands has the potential to provide important large-scale hydrological information regarding ecological and carbon-balance processes occurring within such systems. This article details how field knowledge of the spectral properties of Sphagnum spp., airborne remote sensing data and a range of image analysis approaches, may be combined to provide a suitable proxy for near-surface wetness. Co-incident field and airborne remote sensing data were acquired in May and September 2002 over an important UK raised bog (Cors Fochno). A combination of laboratory-tested NIR and SWIR water-based and biophysical spectral reflectance indices were applied to field and airborne reflectance spectra of Sphagnum pulchrum to elucidate changes in near-surface moisture conditions. Field results showed significant correlations between water-based indices (moisture stress index (MSI) and floating water band indices (fWBI(980) and fWBI(1200)))) and measures of both near-surface volumetric moisture content (VMC) and water-table position. Spectral indices formulated from the NIR (fWBI(980) and fWBI(1200)) proved to be the most useful for indicating near-surface wetness across the widest range of moisture conditions because of their ability to penetrate deeper into the Sphagnum canopy. Correlations between a biophysical index based upon chlorophyll content and both hydrological measures were not significant, possibly due to relatively high levels of surface wetness at the field site in both May and September. S. pulchrum lawns were successfully located and mapped from airborne imagery using the mixed tuned match filtering (MTMF) algorithm. Importantly, MSI derived from airborne data was significantly correlated with both field moisture and the water-table position. Relationships between measures of near-surface wetness and the MSI for naturally heterogeneous canopies were, however, found to be weaker for airborne imagery than for associated field data. This is likely to be a result of the formulation of the MSI itself and the possible preferential detection of "wetter" pixels within the imagery. This effectively reduced the ability of MSI to detect subtle changes in near-surface wetness under high moisture conditions, but would not impede the use of the index under drier conditions. Results from the field data suggest that indices formulated from the NIR may be more suitable for detailed estimations of near-surface and surface wetness at the landscape-scale although reliable hyperspectral data are required to test fully the performance of such indices. The relative merits of using such an approach to determine near-surface hydrological conditions across entire peatland complexes are also discussed. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Extensive alteration of the tidal salt marshes of San Francisco Bay has created an urgent need to preserve the few remaining areas of relatively pristine tidal marshes. The dynamics of these marshes can be quantified and mapped using the high vertical and horizontal point density of airborne laser scanners (lidar) if their data quality is adequate. We evaluated lidar's ability to characterize wetland topography and vegetation structure, with emphasis on measuring short-term changes associated with the invasive Spartina. Measurable errors between flight lines and between laser returns were observed. By comparing lidar datasets with ground measurements we found that lidar did not reach the ground underneath vegetation. Nonetheless, change detection using digital surface models showed that Spartina markedly affected the accretion - erosion patterns of the shoreline and the water drainage patterns on the mudflat. With some exceptions, Spartina patches showed evident expansion patterns with rates of up to 2.5 m/year. Our study indicates that lidar has a great potential to discriminate Spartina species and marsh components, and to quantify sediment dynamics associated with the Spartina invasion, and changes in Spartina structure and biomass.

AB The availability of multiple ASTER image acquisitions enables regional-scale geological mapping, though instrument, irradiance, atmospheric and surface scattering effects can cause problems in generating seamless mosaics of geological information products. These issues, including shortwave infrared (SWIR) crosstalk, were addressed in producing seamless ASTER geological maps over the Cumamona Province, associated with the world class Pb-Zn-Ag Broken Hill deposit. Over 35 ASTER scenes covering an area of approximately 52,000 km(2) from 14 different overpass dates were acquired. Maps of Al-OH and Mg-OH/carbonate were generated from ASTER SWIR data as well as a map of quartz content from the thermal infrared (TIR) data. Maps of ferrous iron content were also generated from the SWIR data of individual ASTER scenes. The SWIR bands also enabled qualitative mapping of the Al-OH composition though garnet and feldspar - rich units were not well mapped using the TIR. Field sampling and spectral measurements, together with detailed 1 :25,000 mapping and large-scale HyMap surveying, constrained the accuracy of the ASTER-derived geological products.

AB This study presents an innovative approach to map microphytobenthos biomass and fractional cover in Bourgneuf Bay (French Atlantic coast) using Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS) hyperspectral data. Microphytobenthos is a microalgae forming a biofilm on the mudflat. Its spatial distribution is heterogeneous so it varies on a finer scale than that of airborne instrument spatial resolution, leading to a "mixed pixel" problem. Moreover, some microphytobenthic species form, at low tide, a biofilm deposited at the surface of the sediment substrate. The resulting signal is a highly non-linear combination of spectral endmembers due to microscale intimate mixtures. This prevents the use of classical linear unmixing models to retrieve biomass from reflectance spectra. A Modified Gaussian Model (MGM) is therefore used to remove the effects of surface roughness, shadowing and any other unknown processes that contribute to the overall shape (continuum) of the reflectance spectra. Then, relationships between microphytobenthos biomass and spectral shapes are derived from a spectral database compiled from laboratory reflectance spectra of microalgal monospecific cultures with different biomasses. Finally, microphytobenthos biomass and fractional cover are retrieved from the DAIS image by comparing the reflectance spectra of each pixel to a library of synthetic spectra corresponding to combinations of various biomasses and substrate percent cover. This new approach, when compared to more classically used ones such as indices, linear unmixing or spectral distance analysis, is proven to enable a much more reliable determination of biomass despite the large variety of substrates found in Bourgneuf Bay.

AB The estimation of vegetation water content (VWC) over a crop-growing period was performed using the near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands of the Terra-MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Terra-MODIS). The study was conducted in Iowa, USA as part of the Soil Moisture Experiments 2002 (SMEX02). Due to the moderate resolution of MODIS data, the removal of mixed pixels was important in order to meet accuracy estimation requirements of potential applications. MODIS-derived reflectance for the NIR and SWIR bands over corn and soybeans fields was validated using atmospherically corrected Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) data. All possible combinations of the 7 MODIS bands were used to construct VIs. The performance of each combination was evaluated by computing their correlations with corn VWC. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were found to be the best candidates. In this study, it was observed that the MODIS SWIR-based VI for corn saturated at a later date than NDVI. A similar late saturation was observed for soybeans with a lag of about 10 days. Linear relationships between the SWIR-based VI and VWC were developed using the MODIS data and ground measured VWC. MODIS-derived Normalized Difference Water Indices (NDWI) using SWIR (1640 nm) or SWIR (2130 nm), namely NDWI1640 or NDW1(2130), all showed potential in estimating VWC. Additional testing of this approach could result in a robust technique for estimating VWC for specific crops. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge of land surface evapotranspiration is of prime interest for environmental applications, such as optimizing irrigation water use, especially in and and semiarid rangelands where water shortage is a critical problem. Numerous methods aiming at estimating evapotranspiration have been proposed in the literature. In the current paper, we assess the potential of the evaporative fraction based on the S-SEBI (Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index) concept for estimating instantaneous evapotranspiration, and extend this potential to the retrieval of daily evapotranspiration (ETA To this end, a feasible and operational method is developed, which allows mapping instantaneous and daily evapotranspiration over the Alpilles ReSeDA (Remote Sensing Data Assimilation) experimental area. The method is implemented using data collected with two airborne sensors: PolDER (Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectance) and a Thermal camera. The validation over test sites shows that daily evapotranspiration can be obtained within an error of 1 mind(-1). Finally a daily evapotranspiration image for the Alpilles ReSeDA experimental site is presented. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Information of crop phenology is essential for evaluating crop productivity and crop management. Therefore we developed a new method for remotely determining phenological stages of paddy rice. The method consists of three procedures: (i) prescription of multi-temporal MODIS/Terra data; (ii) filtering time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data by time-frequency analysis; and (iii) specifying the phenological stages by detecting the maximum point, minimal point and inflection point from the smoothed EVI time profile. Applying this method to MODIS data, we determined the planting date, heading date, harvesting date, and growing period in 2002. And we validated the performance of the method against statistical data in 30 paddy fields. As for the filtering, we adopted wavelet and Fourier transforms. Three types of mother wavelet (Daubechies, Symlet and Coiflet) were used in Wavelet transform. As the results of validation, the wavelet transform performed better than the Fourier transform. Specifically, the case using Coiflet (order=4) gave remarkably good results in determining phenological stages and growing periods. The root mean square errors of the estimated phenological dates against the statistical data were: 12.1 days for planting date, 9.0 days for heading date, 10.6 days for harvesting date, and 11.0 days for growing period. The method using wavelet transform with Coiflet (order=4) allows the determination of regional characteristics of rice phenology. We proposed this new method using the wavelet transform; Wavelet based Filter for determining Crop Phenology (WFCP). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Remote sensing often involves the estimation of in situ quantities from remote measurements. Linear regression, where there are no non-linear combinations of regressors, is a common approach to this prediction problem in the remote sensing community. A review of recent remote sensing articles using univariate linear regression indicates that in the majority of cases, ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression has been applied, with approximately half the articles using the in situ observations as regressors and the other half using the inverse regression with remote measurements as regressors. OLS implicitly assume an underlying normal structural data model to arrive at unbiased estimates of the response. OLS regression can be a biased predictor in the presence of measurement errors when the regression problem is based on a functional rather than structural data model. Parametric (Modified Least Squares) and non-parametric (Theil-Sen) consistent predictors are given for linear regression in the presence of measurement errors together with analytical approximations of their prediction confidence intervals. Three case studies involving estimation of leaf area index from nadir reflectance estimates are used to compare these unbiased estimators with OLS linear regression. A comparison to Geometric Mean regression, a standardized version of Reduced Major Axis regression, is also performed. The Theil-Sen approach is suggested as a potential replacement of OLS for linear regression in remote sensing applications. It offers simplicity in computation, analytical estimates of confidence intervals, robustness to outliers, testable assumptions regarding residuals and requires limited a priori information regarding measurement errors.

AB Remotely sensed multispectral thermal infrared (8-13 mu m) images are increasingly being used to map variations in surface silicate mineralogy. These studies utilize the shift to longer wavelengths in the main spectral feature in minerals in this wavelength region (reststrahlen band) as the mineralogy changes from felsic to mafic. An approach is described for determining the amount of this shift and then using the shift with a reference curve, derived from laboratory data, to remotely determine the weight percent SiO2 of the surface. The approach has broad applicability to many study areas and can also be fine-tuned to give greater accuracy in a particular study area if field samples are available. The approach was assessed using airborne multispectral thermal infrared images from the Hiller Mountains, Nevada, USA and the Tres Virgenes-La Reforma, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Results indicate the general approach slightly overestimates the weight percent SiO2 of low silica rocks (e.g. basalt) and underestimates the weight percent SiO2 of high silica rocks (e.g. granite). Fine tuning the general approach with measurements from field samples provided good results for both areas with errors in the recovered weight percent SiO2 of a few percent. The map units identified by these techniques and traditional mapping at the Hiller Mountains demonstrate the continuity of the crystalline rocks from the Hiller Mountains southward to the White Hills supporting the idea that these ranges represent an essentially continuous footwall block below a regional detachment. Results from the Baja California data verify the most recent volcanism to be basaltic-andesite. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An algorithm is presented, which is designed to identify blue-absorbing aerosols from near infrared and visible remote-sensing observations, as they are in particular collected by satellite ocean color sensors. The technique basically consists in determining an error budget at one wavelength around 5 10 nm, based on a first-guess estimation of the atmospheric path reflectance as if the atmosphere was of a maritime type, and on a reasonable hypothesis about the marine signal at this wavelength. The budget also includes the typical calibration uncertainty and the natural variability in the ocean optical properties. Identification of blue-absorbing aerosols is then achieved when the error budget demonstrates a significant over-correction of the atmospheic signal when using non-absorbing maritime aerosols. Implementation of the algorithm is presented, and its application to real observations by the MERIS and SeaWiFS ocean color sensors is discussed. The results demonstrate the skill of the algorithm in various regions of the ocean where absorbing aerosols are present, and for two different sensors. A validation of the results is also performed against in situ data from the AERONET, and further illustrates the skill of the algorithm and its general applicability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) potential open water algorithm (MPA) uses infrared satellite images to retrieve sea-ice concentration. From these data, composite maps of the sea-ice concentration are generated at up to 1-km resolution, in order to serve as input for high-resolution atmospheric models. In the present study, aircraft and helicopter-based measurements from the field experiment "Atmospheric Boundary layer and Sea-ice Interaction Study" (ABSIS) are used to validate the MPA-based sea-ice concentration maps with in-situ measurements: Aircraft measurements of upwelling longwave radiation are used to derive reference values of the sea-ice concentration. MPA-based maps are checked for accuracy of sea-ice concentration values as well as for the preservation of the sea-ice concentration distribution function. This error analysis yields that sea-ice concentration can be determined from MODIS data with approximately +/- 10% error. The compilation of composite maps from multiple overpasses leads to an overall uncertainty of 11.5%. Helicopter-based measurements of the sea-ice thickness are used to study the dependence of MPA-based sea-ice concentration with respect to sea-ice thickness. The dependence turns out to be minimal. Finally, MPA sea-ice concentration is compared to the popular Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) sea-ice concentration data. Both data sets are found to agree within +/- 7%.

AB Bio-optical measurements of spectral upwelling radiance and surface chlorophyll-a concentration have been conducted during 15 cruises between 1995 and 2004. The bio-optical data were divided into two sub-sets: the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (SwAO), comprising a variety of biogeochemical provinces, from the oligotrophic waters in the South Atlantic gyre to the coastal waters influenced by La Plata River and Palos Lagoon discharge, and the Southern Ocean (SO) data set, comprising sampling stations south of the mean position of the Polar Front, with most stations being located in the vicinity of the Antarctic Peninsula. We derived regional chlorophyll algorithms for both regions and comparisons were made with the NASA's OC4v4 (operational algorithm) and OC2v4. For the Southwestern Atlantic region, the NASA OC4v4 algorithm presented a reasonable performance (r(2)=0.87, rmse-L=0.475, N=136) as compared to the revised algorithm for SwAO data (r(2)=0.89, rmse-L=0.426, N=136). A few stations under strong river plume influence were not considered in the analyses. These were detected by a higher reflectance at 670 nm, at low in situ chlorophyll concentration (< 2 mg m(-3)). These results show that empirical algorithms applied to in-situ radiance data have a limited ability to extract accurate chlorophyll estimates below a 30% uncertainty level. For Southern Ocean stations, a 2-band linear-type model was generated (r(2)=0.64, rmse-L=0.347, N=77), which significantly improved the bias (6.4%) as compared to NASA's OC4v4 algorithm (bias=-21.7%). An evaluation of some published high-latitude algorithms on our data set has shown a better performance by taxon-specific models, even from distant regions. A validation experiment of the normalized spectral water-leaving radiances and chlorophyll-a SeaWiFS products was also conducted using the FURG-SwAO/SO data set, through a match-up exercise. Despite the relatively low number of pairs of radiometric measurements, SeaWiFS estimations compare well with in situ data (0.77 < r(2)< 0.98, N=21), although the satellite estimate show a marked bias (-35.6%) in the blue band nL(w) (412). Regarding the chlorophyll-a concentration, an overall agreement was observed (r(2)=0.77, rmse-L=0.66, N=28), with a mean absolute percentage difference of 66%, which is above the goal generally accepted of 35% for satellite ocean color chlorophyll estimates. For the studied Southern Ocean area (mainly the Bransfield Strait), NASA's OC4v4 algorithm systematically underestimates chlorophyll above 0.2 mg m(-3), as previously demonstrated by other researchers.

AB We compared the results of seafloor classifications with special emphasis on detecting coral versus non-coral areas that were obtained from a 4x4-m pixel-resolution multispectral IKONOS satellite image and two acoustic surveys using a QTC View Series 5 system on 50 and 200 kHz signal frequency. A detailed radiative transfer model was obtained by in situ measurement of optical parameters that then allowed calibration of the IKONOS image against in situ optical measurements and a series of ground-truthing points. Eight benthic classes were distinguished optically with an overall accuracy of 69% and a Tau index T of 65. The classification of the IKONOS image allowed discrimination of three different coral assemblages (dense live, dense dead, sparse), which were confirmed by ground-truthing. Data evaluation of the acoustic surveys involved culling of datapoints with < 90% confidence and < 30% probability, two QTC-provided statistics, and the deletion of data classes without clear spatial patterns (visualized by single-class trackplots). The deletion of these ubiquitous classes was necessary in order to obtain any clearly interpretable spatial pattern of echo classes after the surveys were resampled to a regular grid and areas between the lines interpolated using a nearest neighbor algorithm. The 50 kHz acoustic seafloor classification was able to determine two classes (unconsolidated sand versus hardground) but was not able to determine corals. The 200 kHz survey determined high rugosity (=corals and sand ripples) versus low rugosity (=flat areas) but was not able to determine consolidated and unconsolidated sediments. Classes were extrapolated to the entire grid and polygons obtained from the two surveys were combined to provide maps containing four classes (rugose hardground=coral, flat hardground=rock, rugose softground=ripples and algae, flat softground=bare sand). Compared with the classification map derived from the IKONOS image, they were 66% accurate (T=59) when the most highly processed data (only selected classes, > 90% accuracy and > 30% probability) were used, and 60% accurate (T=53) when less processed data (selected classes only, all data) were used. Accuracy against ground-truthing points of the most highly processed dataset was 56% (T=46). These results indicate that results from optical and acoustic surveys have some degree of commonality. Therefore, there is a potential to produce maps outlining coral areas from optical remote-sensing in shallow areas and acoustic methods in adjacent deeper areas beyond optical resolution with the limitation that acoustic maps will resolve fewer habitat classes and have lower accuracy.

AB Using Tampa Bay, FL as an example, we explored the potential for using MODIS medium-resolution bands (250- and 500-m data at 469-, 555-, and 645-nm) for estuarine monitoring. Field surveys during 21-22 October 2003 showed that Tampa Bay has Case-II waters, in that for the salinity range of 24-32 psu, (a) chlorophyll concentration (11 to 23 mg m(-3)), (b) colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) absorption coefficient at 400 nm (0.9 to 2.5 m(-1)), and (c) total suspended sediment concentration (TSS: 2 to 11 mg L(-1)) often do not co-vary. CDOM is the only constituent that showed a linear, inverse relationship with surface salinity, although the slope of the relationship changed with location within the bay. The MODIS medium-resolution bands, although designed for land use, are 4-5 times more sensitive than Landsat-7/ ETM+ data and are comparable to or higher than those of CZCS. Several approaches were used to derive synoptic maps of water constituents from concurrent MODIS medium-resolution data. We found that application of various atmospheric-correction algorithms yielded no significant differences, due primarily to uncertainties in the sensor radiometric calibration and other sensor artifacts. However, where each scene could be aroundtruthed, simple regressions between in situ observations of Constituents and at-sensor radiances provided reasonable synoptic maps. We address the need for improvements of sensor calibration/characterization, atmospheric correction, and bio-optical algorithms to make operational and quantitative use of these medium-resolution bands.

AB Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is an important parameter in the estimation of vegetation growth. A method is presented with which instantaneous PAR can be calculated with high accuracy from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmosphere data products. The method, PARcalc, is based on a simplification of the general radiative transfer equations, whereby the atmosphere is modelled in a few layers depending on the opacity of the atmosphere due to clouds and aerosol load. The four major processes of atmospheric attenuation of solar radiation, Rayleigh scattering, absorption by ozone and water vapour, and aerosol scattering, are treated individually, using calibrated data from MODIS imagery. Comparing the calculations to field measurements made in Costa Rica in 2002, absolute errors in the order of 2-3% are obtained, which should be sufficiently accurate for application of the PARcalc method in models of vegetation growth as a source of incident PAR.

AB Kazakhstan is the second largest country to emerge from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Consequent to the abrupt institutional changes surrounding the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Kazakhstan has reportedly undergone extensive land cover/land use change. Were the institutional changes sufficiently great to affect land surface phenology at spatial resolutions and extents relevant to mesoscale meteorological models? To explore this question, we used the NDVI time series (1985-1988 and 1995-1999) from the Pathfinder Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Land (PAL) dataset, which consists of 10 days maximum NDVI composites at a spatial resolution of 8 km. Daily minimum and maximum temperatures were extracted from the NCEP Reanalysis Project and 10 days composites of accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) were produced. We selected for intensive study seven agricultural areas ranging from regions with rain-fed spring wheat cultivation in the north to regions of irrigated cotton and rice in the south. We applied three distinct but complementary statistical analyses: (1) nonparametric testing of sample distributions; (2) simple time series analysis to evaluate trends and seasonality; and (3) simple regression models describing NDVI as a quadratic function of AGDD.
   The irrigated areas displayed different temporal developments of NDVI between 1985-1988 and 1995-1999. As the temperature regime between the two periods was not significantly different, we conclude that observed differences in the temporal development of NDVI resulted from changes in agricultural practices.
   In the north, the temperature regime was also comparable for both periods. Based on extant socioeconomic studies and our model analyses, we conclude that the changes in the observed land surface phenology in the northern regions are caused by large increases in fallow land dominated by weedy species and by grasslands under reduced grazing pressure. Using multiple lines of evidence allowed us to build a case of whether differences in land surface phenology were mostly the result of anthropogenic influences or interannual climatic fluctuations.

AB Leaf area index (LAI) is an important surface biophysical parameter as a measure of vegetation cover, vegetation productivity, and as an input to ecosystem process models. Recently, a number of coarse-scale (1-km) LAI maps have been generated over large regions including the Canadian boreal forest. This study focuses on the production of fine-scale ( less than or equal to 30-m) LAI maps using the forest light interaction model-clustering (FLIM-CLUS) algorithm over selected boreal conifer stands and the subsequent comparison of the fine-scale maps to coarse-scale LAI maps synthesized from Landsat TM imagery. The fine-scale estimates are validated using surface LAI measurements to give relative root mean square errors of under 7% for jack pine sites and under 14% for black spruce sites. In contrast, finer scale site mean LAI ranges between 49% and 86% of the mean of surface estimates covering only part of the sites and 54% to 110% of coarse-scale site mean LAI. Correlations between fine-scale and coarse-scale estimates range from near 0.5 for 30-m coarse-scale images to under 0.3 to 1-km coarse-scale images but increase to near 0.90 after imposing fine-scale zero LAI areas in coarse-scale estimates. The increase suggests that coarse-scale image-based LAI estimates require consideration of sub-pixel open areas. Both FLIM-CLUS and coarse-scale site mean LAI are substantially lower than surface estimates over northern sites. The assumption of spatially random residuals in regression-based estimates of LAI may not be valid and may therefore add to local bias errors in estimating LAI remotely. Differences between fine-scale airborne LAI maps and 30-m-scale Landsat TM LAI maps suggests that, for sparse boreal conifer stands, LAI maps produced from Landsat TM alone may not always be sufficient for validation of coarser scale LAI maps. In addition, previous studies may have used biased LAI estimates over the study site. Fine-scale spatial LAI maps offer one means of assessing and correcting for effects of sub-pixel open area patches and for characterising the spatial pattern of residuals in coarse-scale LAI estimates in comparison to the true distribution of LAI on the surface.

AB Accurate surface temperature retrieval using thermal infrared observations from satellites is important for surface energy balance modeling; however it is difficult to achieve without proper correction for atmospheric effects. Typically the atmospheric correction is obtained from radiosonde profiles and a radiative transfer model (RTM). But rigorous RTM processing is impractical for routine continental scale modeling because of long computational times. An alternative, simpler, and faster approach for correcting observations in the 10-12.5 mum band is developed from a previously published water vapor continuum absorption function. Using the RTM program MODTRAN as a reference, the function is calibrated against 159 radiosondes, and then validated against the TIGR radiosonde (1761 profiles) data set. Implementation of the calibrated absorption function usually produced larger temperature corrections than without calibration, an effect due to water vapor band type absorption and to non-water vapor constituents. The resulting surface temperature estimates, within 0.8 degreesC of MODTRAN estimates, were achieved at 15 x less processing time than MODTRAN. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Meteorological records show that central Asia has experienced one of the strongest warming signals in the world over the last 3 0 years. The objective of this study was to examine the seasonal vegetation response to the recent climatic variation on the Mongolian steppes, the third largest grassland in the world. The onset date of green-up for central Asia was estimated using time-series analysis of advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) biweekly composite data collected between January 1982 and December 1991. Monthly precipitation and mean temperature data (1982-1990) were acquired from 19 meteorological stations throughout the grasslands of the eastern Mongolian steppes in China. Our results showed that while the taiga forest north of the Mongolian steppes (>50degreesN) experienced an earlier onset of green-up during the study period, a later onset was observed at the eastern and northern edges of the Gobi Desert (40degreesN-50degreesN). Responses of different vegetation types to climatic variability appeared to vary with vegetation characteristics and spring soil moisture availability of specific sites. Plant stress caused by drought was the most significant contributor to later vegetation green-up as observed from satellite imagery over the desert steppe. Areas with greater seasonal soil moisture greened up earlier in the growing season. Our results suggested that water budget limitations determine the pattern of vegetation responses to atmospheric warming. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The historical record of in situ measurements of the terminus positions of the Pasterze and Kleines Fleisskees glaciers in the eastern Alps of Austria is used to assess uncertainties in the measurement of decadal scale changes using satellite data. Topographic maps beginning in 1893, and satellite data from 1976 to 2001, were studied in concert with ground measurements to measure glacier changes. Ground measurements show that the tongue of the Pasterze Glacier receded similar to 1150 m from 1893 to 2001, while satellite-derived measurements, using August 2001 Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data registered to an 1893 topographic map, show a recession of 1300-1800 m, with an unknown error. The measurement accuracy depends on the registration technique and the pixel resolution of the sensor when two satellite images are used. When using topographic maps, an additional source of error is the accuracy of the glacier position shown on the map. Between 1976 and 2001, Landsat-derived measurements show a recession of the terminus of the Pasterze Glacier of 479 136 m (at an average rate of 19.1 m a(-1)) while measurements from the ground showed a recession of 428 m (at an average rate of 17.1 m a(-1)). Four-meter resolution Ikonos satellite images from 2000 and 2001 reveal a shrinkage of 22,096 +/- 46 m(2) in the Pasterze tongue. The nearby Kleines Fleisskees glacier lost 30% of its area between 1984 and 2001, and the area of exposed ice increased by 0.44 +/- 0.0023 km(2), according to Landsat satellite measurements. As more recent satellite images are utilized, especially data that are geocoded, the uncertainty associated with measuring glacier changes has decreased. It is not possible to assess the uncertainty when an old topographic map and a satellite image are coregistered. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The change in ISA is presented as an ecological indicator to examine the cumulative water resource impacts on mussel population in three sub-watersheds of Line Creek-namely, Line, Flat, and Whitewater creeks. The satellite analysis shows that ISA expansion occurred substantially from 1987 to 1997 and is predominantly in industrial, commercial, and shopping center (ICS) complexes but also in smaller lot-size residential development. Evidence of mussel habitat degradation is indicated and loss of species (in the region of 50 to 70%) is present in areas where ISA expansion is observed-specifically in ICS complex development in and around Peachtree City that drains directly into the Line and Flat creeks. This is in marked contrast to Whitewater Creek where overall development of ISA is less and no major loss of mussel species is observed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Wildfires are a major cause of land degradation in the Mediterranean region due to their frequent recurrence in the same areas. The evaluation of fire risk is therefore of high practical importance, particularly during the summer and season, when fires are most frequent and harmful. Recent studies have demonstrated that the evaluation of dynamic fire risk can be carried out by the use of remotely sensed images, and specifically of NOAA-AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data. This use relies on the sensitivity of the index to vegetation dryness, which is a major predisposing factor for fire occurrence. Several problems, however, remain linked to the spatial variability of the risk in environmentally heterogeneous areas, which requires the application of suitable processing techniques to the low-resolution imagery.
   The current work reports on the development and testing of different methodologies for estimating dynamic fire risk by the use of NOAA-AVHRR data. The investigation was conducted in Tuscany (Central Italy) using a large archive of fires that occurred in the region and NOAA-AVHRR NDVI data of 16 years (1985-2000). Relying on previous methodological achievements of our group and other research groups, several procedures were tested to extract information related to fire risk from the remotely sensed images. These trials led to define an optimum method which is based on the identification of pixels where the accordance between interyear variations in fire probabilities and NDVI values is maximum. The accuracy of the risk estimates from this optimum method was finally evaluated by a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. In this way, the performance of the methodology was assessed, together with its potential for operational fire risk monitoring and forecasting in Mediterranean areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

ID RESOLUTION; IMAGERY
AB Stand delineation and species composition estimation are cornerstones of forest inventory mapping and key elements to forest management decision making. Improved mapping techniques are constantly being sought in terms of speed, consistency, accuracy, level of detail, and overall effectiveness. Semi-automated analysis of high-resolution imagery at the individual tree crown level may offer such benefits. Methods, however, need to be developed and tested under a variety of forest conditions.
   High-resolution (60 cm) multispectral airborne imagery was acquired over a predominantly young conifer forest and plantation test area on the west coast of Canada. Automated tree isolation algorithms were applied to the data in order to delineate tree crowns or clusters of crowns. An object-oriented single tree classification was conducted using a maximum likelihood classifier. Stands of similar species composition, closure, and stem density were defined through a sequence that first generated images of these parameters from the automated delineation and classification, used these as input to an unsupervised classification, and then filtered and smoothed the resulting classification clusters. Because of the dense nature of the stands and small crowns on the site, the isolation process often delineated clusters of several trees. Species classification accuracy was determined by comparing the average stand composition from the automated technique to that derived from ground transects or plots. Species classification was good, with average composition error (difference between field measured and automated composition) over all 16 test stands being 7.25%. Most errors for individual species in stands were below 20%, but a few were up to 30%. The automatically generated stand boundaries mimicked well those of known plantation and interpreted inventory boundaries. The automated technique created a few larger stands and some additional small stands in areas of complex forest structure. Overall, for the young fairly uniform stands of the site, both stand delineation and species composition estimation were of a quality suitable for operational use in inventory and forest management. Further development and testing is needed to extend results to situations covering large areas, multiple flight lines, varied topography, and different forest conditions.

AB Because of the high water content of vegetation, water absorption features dominate spectral reflectance of vegetation in the near-infrared region of the spectrum. In comparison to indices based on chlorophyll absorption features (such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)), indices based on the water absorption bands are expected to "see" more deeply into thick canopies and have a preferential sensitivity to thin as opposed to thick tissues. These predictions are based on the much lower absorption coefficients for water in the short wavelength water bands as compared to chlorophyll. Thus, the water bands may have advantages over NDVI for remote sensing of photosynthetic tissues. Previous studies have primarily related water band indices (WI) to leaf area index (LAI). Here we expand the definition of photosynthetic tissues to include thin green stems and fruits and measure a wide range of species to determine the influence of variable tissue morphologies and canopy structures on these relationships. As expected, indices based on reflectance in the water absorption bands in the near infrared were best correlated with the water content of thin tissues (less than 0.5-cm thickness). The choice of wavelength for a water index was much more important for thick than for thin canopies, and the best wavelengths were those where water absorptance was weak to moderate. We identified three wavelength regions (950-970, 1150-1260 and 1520-1540 nm) that produced the best overall correlations with water content. Comparison of these wavelength regions with the atmospheric "windows" where water vapor absorption is minimal suggests that the 11501260 and 1520-1540 nm regions would be the best wavelengths for satellite remote sensing of water content. We also developed and tested a new Canopy Structure Index (CSI) that combines the low absorptance water bands with the simple ratio vegetation index (SR) to produce an index with a wider range of sensitivity to photosynthetic tissue area at all canopy thicknesses. CSI was better than either WI or SR alone for prediction of total area of photosynthetic. tissues. However, SR was best for prediction of leaf area when other green tissues were excluded. All of these relationships showed good generality across a wide range of species and functional types. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The land surface albedo is a key parameter influencing the climate near the ground. Therefore, it must be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, a statistical inversion method is presented in support of the application of kernel-based Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) models for the calculation of the surface albedo. The method provides the best linear unbiased estimations (BLUE) of the BRDF model coefficients for an arbitrary number of available angular measurements. When the number of measurements exceeds the number of the estimated coefficients, the QR decomposition method is proposed to improve the ill-conditional features of the inversion matrix. In other cases, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method is suggested. The proposed inversion method is innovative in that it provides confidence intervals for each of the BRDF model coefficients with a prescribed significance expressed by a probability level. Five candidate kernel-driven BRDF models were used in the present simulation study: Li-Sparse, Roujean, Li-Sparse-Wanner, Li-Dense and Walthall. A ground-based reflectance measurement data set including 11 surface types forms the background for the inversion experiments. The results show a strong dependence on the solar zenith angle (SZA) and on the land cover type (LCT) for all candidate models. Owing to this, none model could be recommend in a general manner. The Li-Sparse and the Li-Sparse-Wanner models performed the best for the grass and wheat LCT, while the Roujean model appeared as a favorite for the pine and deciduous forests. The implementation of the confidence interval technique shows that the BRDF model coefficients can be retrieved with an uncertainty of 20-30%, and somewhat greater in the case of forest. The measured angular reflectance curves lie, as a rule, within the uncertainty bands related to the 5% significance level (95% probability). The corresponding albedo estimates can be characterized by an absolute uncertainty of 1-2% in the visible band and 5-10% in the near infrared band, or by 10-30% in relative terms. The reflectance measurements at low SZA values are preferable for BRDF model inversion for the grassland and crop, while medium range of SZA seems to provide more information on forest features. For the majority of LCT, the results of BRDF model inversion seem to be less reliable when considering multi-angular measurements for various SZA than for a single SZA. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

AB In the management of natural resources, multiple variables correlated with each other usually need to be mapped jointly. However, joint mapping and spatial uncertainty analyses are very difficult mainly because of interactions among variables and imperfection of existing methods. There is abundant evidence that considering interactions among variables and spatial information from neighbors can result in improved maps. This study presents a remote sensing-aided method for that purpose. The method is based on the integration of joint sequential co-simulation with Landsat TM image for mapping and polynomial regression for spatial uncertainty analysis. The method was applied to a case study in which ground cover (GC), canopy cover (CC), and vegetation height (VH) were jointly mapped to derive a map of the vegetation cover factor for predicting soil loss. The variance contributions from the variables, their interactions, and the spatial information from neighbors leading to uncertainty of predicted vegetation cover factor were assessed. The results showed that in addition to unbiased maps, this method reproduced the spatial variability of the variables and the spatial correlation among them, and successfully quantified the effect of variation from all the components on the prediction of the vegetation cover factor.

AB One of the aims of the EU funded project Long-term regional effects of climate change on European forests: impact assessment and consequences for carbon budgets (LTEEF-II, ENV4-CT97-0577) is to quantify the fluxes of carbon and water between vegetation (forests) and atmosphere and to assess the carbon balance of forests in Europe.
   This paper presents the results of the application of the C-Fix model within the frame of part of the objectives of the LTEEF-II project, as defined for the European continental scale.
   A description of the C-Fix model is presented in the first part of this paper. C-Fix is a Monteith type parametric model driven by temperature, radiation and fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (WAR), the last variable derived by processing NOAA/AVHRR data of 1997 acquired over Europe as well as VEGETATION (VGT) data for the same region for the period 1998-1999. In a second part of the paper, the main results obtained are described, e.g. net ecosystem fluxes for forest, calculated locally for the Euroflux CO2 measurement sites as well as for the whole continent. The model simulations were evaluated with eddy covariance measurements of NEP performed during 1997 at the Euroflux sites. Moreover, a comparison between NEP determined with NOAA/AVHRR data, opposed to NEP simulations based on VGT data is performed. A difference up to 20% is obtained between both data sets. Finally A C-Fix estimate of total European vegetation NEP obtained with NOAA/AVHRR data for 1997 is 2.70 +/- 32% Pg C, (P = 10(15) g, % is 95% confidence limit). This estimate decreases to 2.15 +/- 43% Pg C when VGT data for the period April 1998-March 1999 are used. The total forest NEP for Europe, however, is estimated at 0.735 Pg C for 1997. Along a North-South transect at 13degrees east, through Europe a clear increase in NEP and the other basic carbon mass fluxes GPP and NPP is modelled from northern to southern latitudes. Moreover, along this transect the values simulated with C-Fix for NEP corresponds well with the eddy covariance NEP estimates for the Euroflux sites. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB Spatial and temporal changes in urban reflectance have a strong influence on energy flux through the urban environment. Optical sensors on operational satellites provide self-consistent time series of urban reflectance variations, but quantitative analyses are complicated by spectral heterogeneity at sensor instantaneous field of view (IFOV) scales and by temporal changes in illumination and atmospheric conditions. These complications can be minimized by combining a multitemporal radiometric rectification with a physically based reflectance analysis. Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) provides a physically based approach to quantifying spatial and temporal changes in spectrally heterogeneous urban reflectance. Multitemporal analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery of the New York metropolitan area suggests that urban reflectance can be described with a three-component linear mixture model spanned by high albedo, low albedo, and vegetation endmembers. The topology of the spectral mixing space indicates that mixing fractions are well constrained for the vegetation endmember and that nonlinear mixing occurs primarily between the high and low albedo endmembers. Selection of pseudoinvariant (PIV) image endmembers allows radiometric rectification of multitemporal imagery to a common set of endmembers, thereby minimizing variations in radiance that are unrelated to changes in surface reflectance. Inversion of the three-component linear mixture model for the New York metro area produces robust, consistent fraction estimates for different combinations of rectifications and inversion constraints. Temporal variation of the presumed invariant endmember sites provides a measure of uncertainty for the endmember fraction estimates. The resulting vegetation fraction estimates agree with high-resolution reference measurements to within 10% for a 1996 midsummer validation and PIV endmember fraction estimates vary by less than 7% over the course of the 1996 growing season. In contrast, intraurban spatial variations in vegetation fraction span several tens of percent, suggesting that the measured changes significantly exceed the uncertainty of the estimates. These results suggest that Landsat TM imagery may be used to monitor seasonal to interannual variations in urban reflectance and vegetation abundance. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB The Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) microwave satellite radiometer and its predecessor SMMR are primary sources of information for global sea ice and climate studies. However, comparisons of SSM/I, Landsat, AVHRR, and ERS-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) have shown substantial seasonal and regional differences in their estimates of sea ice concentration. To evaluate these differences, we compared SSM/I estimates of sea ice coverage derived with the NASA Team and Bootstrap algorithms to estimates made using RADARSAT, and OKEAN-01 satellite sensor data. The study area included the Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, and adjacent parts of the Arctic Ocean, during October 1995 through October 1999. Ice concentration estimates from spatially and temporally near-coincident imagery were calculated using independent algorithms for each sensor type. The OKEAN algorithm implemented the satellite's two-channel active (radar) and passive microwave data in a linear mixture model based on the measured values of brightness temperature and radar backscatter. The RADARSAT algorithm utilized a segmentation approach of the measured radar backscatter, and the SSM/I ice concentrations were derived at National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) using the NASA Team and Bootstrap algorithms. Seasonal and monthly differences between SSM/I, OKEAN, and RADARSAT ice concentrations were calculated and compared. Overall, total sea ice concentration estimates derived independently from near-coincident RADARSAT, OKEAN-01, and SSM/I satellite imagery demonstrated mean differences of less than 5.5% (S.D. < 9.5%) during the winter period. Differences between the SSM/I NASA Team and the SSM/I Bootstrap concentrations were no more than 3.1% (S.D. < 5.4%) during this period. RADARSAT and OKEAN-01 data both yielded higher total ice concentrations than the NASA Team and the Bootstrap algorithms. The Bootstrap algorithm yielded higher total ice concentrations than the NASA Team algorithm. Total ice concentrations derived from OKEAN-01 and SSM/I satellite imagery were highly correlated during winter, spring, and fall, with mean differences of less than 8.1% (S.D. < 15%) for the NASA Team algorithm, and less than 2.8% (S.D. < 13.8%) for the Bootstrap algorithm. Respective differences between SSM/I NASA Team and SSM/I Bootstrap total concentrations were less than 5.3% (S.D. < 6.9%). Monthly mean differences between SSM/I and OKEAN differed annually by less than 6%, with smaller differences primarily in winter. The NASA Team and Bootstrap algorithms underestimated the total sea ice concentrations relative to the RADARSAT ScanSAR no more than 3.0% (S.D. < 9%) and 1.2% (S.D. < 7.5%) during cold months, and no more than 12% and 7% during summer, respectively. ScanSAR tended to estimate higher ice concentrations for ice concentrations greater than 50%, when compared to SSM/I during all months. ScanSAR underestimated total sea ice concentration by 2% compared to the OKEAN-01 algorithm during cold months, and gave an overestimation by 2% during spring and summer months. Total NASA Team and Bootstrap sea ice concentration estimates derived from coincident SSM/I and OKEAN-01 data demonstrated mean differences of no more than 5.3% (S.D. < 7%), 3.1% (S.D. < 5.5%), 2.0% (S.D. < 5.5%), and 7.3% (S.D. < 10%) for fall, winter, spring, and summer periods, respectively. Large disagreements were observed between the OKEAN and NASA Team results in spring and summer for estimates of the first-year (FY) and multiyear (MY) age classes. The OKEAN-01 algorithm and data tended to estimate, on average, lower concentrations of young or FY ice and h

AB C-band repeat-pass interferometry, in particular, the coherence, has been shown to be of great potential for stem volume retrieval. For boreal forests, we have investigated a stem volume retrieval method based on inversion of ERS-1/2 coherence measurements by means of a semiempirical model. A multitemporal combination of several stem volume estimates has been used in order to reduce errors in the estimation. The retrieval procedure was first applied in a forest estate located in Kattbole, Sweden, where accurate in situ measurements were taken. Stem volume was determined both at the stand level (between 2 and 14 ha) and at the pixel level (25 x 25 m). A multitemporal combination of coherence data acquired in stable winter-type conditions gave the most accurate results. Based on the results obtained in Kattbole, the retrieval procedure was extended to a large area of 4235 km(2) around Kattbole. Retrieval was performed in all forested areas on a pixel basis (25 x 25 m), generating stem volume maps. In Kattbole, at the stand level, stem volume up to 350 m(3)/ha was estimated with an error comparable to the ground truth, i.e. 10 m(3)/ha. At the pixel level, the error reached the value of 55 and 71 m(3)/ha in the forest estate and in the large area, respectively. Compared to the results from the stand analysis, the higher error is believed to be mainly due to the higher uncertainty of coherence estimation at high stem volume and to geometric mismatch between field data and coherence data. Moreover, over large areas, spatial variation of the parameters in the model should be considered. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For decades, researchers have attempted to develop general algorithms for determining the concentration of total suspended matter (TSM) in coastal waters using remotely sensed measurements. On the basis of published work and empirical data, this paper demonstrates that reflectance and other optical parameters, such as the beam attenuation coefficient, are in reality, dependent on the projected surface area (PSA) of the suspended matter. The PSA is shown to be dependent on TSM, the volume concentration (VC), the particle size spectrum, and the mean effective density (Deltap) of the suspended matter. The PSA is calculated for three different particle size spectra and it is shown that PSA can vary by up to three orders of magnitude at a constant value of TSM (if Deltap and the particle size spectrum change). Because reflectance and beam attenuation are de facto related to the PSA, determination of TSM from a reflectance or transmission measurement may potentially have an error of up to a factor of 10 due to variations in Deltap common in coastal and estuarine waters. If Deltap and the size spectrum of the suspended matter are known or can be estimated, it is possible to determine TSM from both types of measurement with better accuracy.

AB Volcanic eruptions can present unpredictable hazards to populations living within regions containing potentially active volcanoes and for people traveling in jet aircraft that intersect with ash-laden eruption clouds. Methods of monitoring volcanic activity include searching for variations in the thermal signal from active fumaroles, lava domes, lava lakes, flows, and other features. Over many active volcanoes in the Western Hemisphere, low spatial resolution (4 km/pixel) weather satellite data acquired every 15 min are used to identify changes in eruptive activity, but are of insufficient spatial resolution to map active volcanic features. The Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on Landsat 7 can be used to monitor active volcanoes at a higher spatial resolution (15- to 60-m pixels). ETM+ also offers improvements over its predecessor, the Thematic Mapper of Landsats 4 and 5, by way of a 15-m panchromatic band and higher spatial resolution (60 m/pixel) thermal infrared (IR) band. With higher spatial resolution panchromatic data, we are able to map lava flow fields, trace very high temperature lava channels, and, at Lascar volcano, identify an arcuate feature associated with a collapsed crater floor, a phenomenon that may precede explosive activity. With improved spatial resolution in the thermal IR, we are able to map the bifurcation and braiding of underground lava tubes at Kilauea. Identifying tube locations and tracking their extension are important because, for a given volumetric lava production (effusion) rate, tube-fed flows can extend a much greater distance than surface flows. At both Kilauea and Etna, we are able to use the thermal data to estimate effusion rates, an important parameter for assessing how far a flow is likely to extend and therefore the hazard it poses. An improved ETM+ data collection and distribution system includes a well-formulated and -executed Long-Term Acquisition Plan and less expensive data that is available much faster than previously possible.

AB Landsat 7 ETM+ provides an opportunity to extend the area and frequency with which we are able to monitor the Earth's surface with fine spatial resolution data. To take advantage of this opportunity it is necessary to move beyond the traditional image-by-image approach to data analysis. A new approach to monitoring large areas is to extend the application of a trained image classifier to data beyond its original temporal, spatial, and sensor domains. A map of forest change in the Cascade Range of Oregon developed with methods based on such generalization shows accuracies comparable to a map produced with current state-of-the-art methods. A test of generalization across sensors to monitor forest change in the Rocky Mountains indicates that Landsat 7 ETM+ data can be combined with earlier Landsat 5 TM data without retraining the classifier. Methods based on generalization require less time and effort than conventional methods and as a result may allow monitoring of larger areas or more frequent monitoring at reduced cost. One key component to achieving this goal is the improved availability and affordability of Landsat 7 imagery. These results highlight the value of the existing Landsat archive and the importance for continuity in the Landsat Program. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

   INFORMATION; UTILITY
AB The utility of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery for estimating forest cover in a boreal test site was evaluated. Corrections were applied to both a spring and a summer image to put the data on the same radiometric scale. A number of features were then tested, including TM bands, spectral indices, and forest cover estimated by inversion of a reflectance model. All features derived from single-date imagery gave only low correlations with measured cover (\R \ < .47), although the spring image had greater utility, Reflectance simulations were used to help understand how a number of scene factors modulated cover estimates. The spring image data were found to give better separation of cover in multispectral plots, greater dynamic ranges, and were less adversely affected by differences in stand structure. The utility of using both images in combination was dependent on how the reflectance information was used, Using TM bands from both dates in model inversions did not improve the results compared to using the spring image only. However, the band differences, taken between dates in TM3 and TM5, respectively. gave the strongest correlations with cover (\R \ =.56 and .64). Experiments using simulated reflectances indicated that the TM5 band difference was less adversely affected than TM5 to between-stand differences in structure and crown reflectances. Temporal reflectance information may thus have some applicability in boreal environments, where the availability of ancillary information, required for accurate inversions using reflectance data, can be very limited. However, further work needs to be undertaken to identify optimal image acquisition dates and to better understand the biophysical aspects of the temporal changes in forest reflectance in boreal conditions.

AB This paper outlines the first part of a series of research studies to investigate the potential and approaches for using optical remote sensing to assess vegetation water content. It first analyzes why most methods used as approximations of vegetation water content (such as vegetation stress indices, estimation of degree of curing and chlorophyll content) are not suitable for retrieving water content at leaf level. It then documents the physical basis supporting the use of remote sensing to directly detect vegetation water content in terms of Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) at leaf level. Using laboratory measurements, the radiative transfer model PROSPECT and a sensitivity analysis, it shows that shortwave infrared (SWIR) is sensitive to EWT but cannot be used alone to retrieve EWT because two other leaf parameters (internal structure and dry matter) also influence leaf reflectance in the SWIR, A combination of SWIR and NIR (only influenced by these two parameters) is necessary to retrieve EWT at leaf level. These results set the basis towards establishing operational techniques for the retrieval of EWT at top-of-canopy and top-of-atmospheric levels. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The reflectance spectra of dried and ground plant foilage are examined for changes directly due to increasing nitrogen concentration. A broadening of the 2.1-mum absorption feature is observed as nitrogen concentration increases. The broadening is shown to arise from two absorptions at 2.054 mum and 2.172 mum. The wavelength positions of these absorptions coincide with the absorption characteristics of the nitrogen-containing amide bonds in proteins. The observed presence of these absorption features in the reflectance spectra of dried foilage is suggested to form a physical basis for high correlations established by stepwise multiple linear regression techniques between the reflectance of dry plant samples and their nitrogen concentration. The consistent change in the 2.1-mum absorption feature as nitrogen increases and the offset position of protein absorptions compared to those of other plant components together indicate that a generally applicable algorithm may be developed for spectroscopic estimates of nitrogen concentration from the reflectance spectra of dried plant foilage samples.

AB Multitemporal, small-format 35-mm aerial photographs were combined in a coregistered database to determine the relative value of spectral and phenological information for overstory tree crown classification of digital images of the Eastern Deciduous Forest. A one-hectare study site, located in a second-growth forest 15 km east of Morgantown, West Virginia, USA, was photographed from a light aircraft nine times from May to October 1997 using both true-color and false-color infrared film. Using this imagery, differences in the spectral properties and timing of phenologic events between tree species made it possible to discriminate four deciduous tree species, namely Liriodendron tulipifera, Acer rubrum, Quercus rubra, and Quercus alba, which made up nearly 99% of the trees at this study site. Optimally timed photography acquired during peak autumn colors provided the best single date of imagery, while photography from spring leaf-out was the second best. The best individual image band for tree species discrimination was the blue band. Classifications using all four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and infrared) and four dates (05/23/97, 06/23/97, 10/11/97, and 10/30/97) provided the best classification accuracies. Variable canopy illumination made digital classification of individual trees complex. A Likelihood Ratio test confirmed that the number of spectral bands included in the classification procedure (spectral resolution) and the number of dates (temporal resolution) significantly influenced the ability to identify tree species correctly. This study suggests that although multispectral data appear to be more valuable than multitemporal data, it may be possible to compensate for the limited spectral resolution of planned high-resolution sensors by combining multiple dates of low spectral resolution images.

AB In this study a number of linear semiempirical kernel-driven (LiSK) bidirectional reflectance distribution fraction (BRDF) models are adjusted against an extensive Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) dataset collected over a variety of semiarid cover types in the southern part of New Mexico and parts of Chihuahua, Mexico as part of the May 1997 Prototype Validation Exercise (PROVE) campaign, an activity of the NASA Earth Observing System Terra validation program. The aim is to investigate model behavior under conditions of sparse angular sampling such as that provided by the AVHRRs and MODIS over a wide variety of southwestern desert surface types Linear semiempirical models of the type to be used in the MODIS/ MISR BRDF/albedo product (MOD43) are inverted, since these are appropriate for use over large areas. The results of the inversions show that these models are able to describe BRDF for a wide variety of surfaces and provide both a means for correcting for directional phenomena in satellite data and for extracting structural information from multiangular reflectance datasets.

AB Because in situ techniques for determining vegetation abundance in semiarid regions are labor intensive, they usually are not feasible for regional analyses. Remotely sensed data provide the large spatial scale necessary, but their precision and accuracy in determining vegetation abundance and its change through time have not been quantitatively determined. In this paper the precision and accuracy of two techniques, Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) applied to Landsat TM data, are assessed quantitatively using high-precision in situ data. In Owens Valley, California we have 6 years of continuous field data (1991-1996) for 33 sites acquired concurrently with six cloudless Landsat TM images. The multitemporal remotely sensed data were coregistered to within 1 pixel, radiometrically intercalibrated using temporally invariant surface features, and geolocated to within 30 m. These procedures facilitated the accurate location of field-monitoring sites within the remotely sensed data. Formal uncertainties in the registration, radiometric alignment, and modeling were determined. Results show that SMA absolute percent live cover (%LC) estimates are accurate to within +/-4.0%LC and estimates of change in live cover have a precision of +/-3.8%LC. Furthermore, even when applied to areas of low vegetation cover the SMA approach correctly determined the sense of change (i.e., positive or negative) in 87% of the samples. SMA results are superior to NDVI, which, although correlated with live cover, is not a quantitative measure and showed the correct sense of change in only 67% of the samples.

AB Wind vector evaluation through Meteosat is useful for a continental belt such as Turkey, where nationwide radiosonde and aircraft data are suboptimal, especially from the point of view of numerical weather prediction (NWP). Towards this goal, investigations have been carried out on the Meteosat cloud motion winds (CMW) using IR imagery with collocated radiosonde data in and around Istanbul with the eventual aim of extending this study to develop general circulation models in the Mediterranean region. The CMW analysis reveals correlation with the radiosonde data superior to that of the European Center for Medium range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) for the period of study. This study also confirms that Meteosat CMWs are subject to less severe speed biases, although there is a tendency to underestimate CMW speeds for low-wind-speed scenarios, as opposed to high wind speeds as suggested in the past studies.

AB The synthesis and modeling of ecological processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales involves bringing together and sharing data from numerous soul-ces. This article describes a data and information system model that facilitates assembling, managing, and sharing diverse data from multiple disciplines, scales, and sites to support. integrated ecological studies. Cross-site scientific-domain working groups coordinate the development of data associated with their particular scientific working group, including decisions about data requirements, data to be compiled data formats, derived data products, and schedules across the sites. The Web-based data and information system consists of nodes for each working group plus a central node that provides data access, project information data query, and other functionality. The approach incorporates scientists and computer experts in the working groups and provides incentives for individuals to submit documented data to the data and information system.

AB A remote sensing technique is presented to estimate the chlorophyll content in higher plants. The ratio between chlorophyll fluorescence at 735 nm and in the range 700-710 nm, F-735/F-700 was found to be linearly proportional to the chlorophyll content (with determination coefficient, r(2), more than 0.95), and, thus, this ratio can be used as a precise indicator of chlorophyll content in plant leaves. This new chlorophyll fluorescence ratio indicates chlorophyll levels with high precision- the eri-or in chlorophyll prediction over a wide range of chlorophyll content (from 41 to 675 rag m(-2)) was less than 40 mg m(-2) The technique was tested and validated in three plant species: beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), elm (Ulmus minor Miller), and wild vine (Parthenocissus tricuspidata L.).

AB Multifrequency and polarimetric Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) images of a sand streak in northern Arizona demonstrate the ability of C- (6-cm wavelength), L- (24 cm), and P-band (68 cm) radar signals to backscatter, respectively, from increasingly greater depths reaching 2 m or more in active blow sand. The studied sand streak, located on a salient of Ward Terrace at lat 35 degrees 48.4'N and long 111 degrees 15.0'W, is sourced in the normally dry Little Colorado River channel and migrates northeastward toward the Moenkopi Plateau Scarp. The sand streak is "radar dark" compared to the "radar-bright" surface of Ward Terrace on all C-band images. It is, however, penetrated completely at P-band and is invisible on thee images. The sand streak is recognizable on the LHH image but is poorly defined on the LHV image. High resolution AIRSAR images constitute the primary data set analyzed: in addition a C-band radar image acquired by the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite is also presented. The spaceborne image data confirms the results of the aircraft data at C-band. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB An investigation was undertaken into the effectiveness of a range of hyperspectral approaches far estimating the concentrations of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b, and the carotenoids at the plant canopy and leaf scales. Measurements of spectral reflectance, biophysical characteristics and pigment composition wee made for a bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) canopy, and its components, throughout a growing season. The results indicate that narrowband reflectance indices, such as the pigment-specific simple ratio (PSSR), can be developed which have extremely strong relationships with the concentration per unit area of individual pigments at the canopy scale. Spectral derivative approaches, particularly those based on pseudo absorbance (Log 1/R), are also closely related to canopy pigment concentration per unit area, but are more useful for deriving estimates of the concentration per unit mass of photosynthetic pigments at both canopy and leaf scales.

AB Airborne in situ and airborne remote sensing methods are used to measure the aerosol optical properties of a biomass burning plume which extended over the ocean during the Sulfate, clouds And Radiation (SCAR) field experiment in the summer of 1994. The University of Washington Convair C131 in situ instrumentation directly measured aerosol characteristics such as size distribution and scattering coefficient at a particular altitude and also measured the optical depth below the aircraft by a lidar instrument mounted on the plane. Almost simultaneously with the C131 pass, radiances were measured by the MODIS Airborne Simulator mounted in the ER-2 NASA aircraft and used to compute optical depths and particle size distribution parameters. These were compared with the same measurements taken by the in situ platform. The effective radii derived by the MAS retrieval algorithm (0.06-0.08 mu m) are consistently smaller than those from the in situ samples taken in this study (0.10-0.14 mu m). The comparison of MAS optical depths and lidar optical depths measured from the in situ platform indicates that the MAS optical depths agree within the range 0.4<tau(MAS)<1.5. Beyond the upper end of this range, where the MAS lookup table interpolates optical depths, the comparison shows less agreement. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB Airborne hyperspectral data were analyzed for the classification of 11 forest cover types, including pure and mixed stands of deciduous and conifer species. Selected bands from first difference reflectance spectra were used to determine cover type at the Harvard Forest using a maximum likelihood algorithm assigning all pixels in the image into one of the 11 categories. This approach combines species specific chemical characteristics and previously derived relationships between hyperspectral data and foliar chemistry. Field data utilized for validation of the classification included both a stand-level survey of stem diameter, and field measurements of plot level foliar biomass. A random selection of validation pixels yielded an overall classification accuracy of 75%. (C)Elsevier Science Inc., 1998

AB The growing of marijuana (Cannabis sativa L.) on public lands poses problems to the environment and the public. Remote sensing offers a potential way of monitoring public lands for the production of marijuana. However, very little information on the spectral properties of marijuana is available in the scientific literature. Our objectives were to 1) characterize the spectral properties of the leaves of marijuana and various other plants that occur where marijuana is grown in the eastern United States, 2) simulate canopy reflectance, and 3) identify wavebands for discriminating marijuana from other plants. In a series of replicated field experiments, the basic factors affecting marijuana growth and reflectance, including planting data, plant density, and N-fertilization were varied. Leaf optical properties were measured periodically during the growing season with a spectroradiometer and integrating sphere. As N-fertilization rate decreased, the marijuana plants produced leaves with lower chlorophyll concentrations and higher reflectance values in the visible wavelength region, particularly at 550 nm. The reflectance spectra of the herbaceous dicot species examined were very similar to the spectrum of marijuana. The reflectance spectra of the monocots and the trees differed significantly from the spectrum of marijuana, particularly in the green and near-infrared wavelength regions. Canopy reflectance spectra of marijuana and several representative species were simulated for a wide range of LAI and background reflectances. Major differences in canopy reflectance of marijuana and other plants were observed near 550 nm, 720 nm, and 800 nm. Dense canopies of marijuana were more spectrally discriminable from other vegetation than sparse canopies. Thus, based on measured leaf spectra and simulated canopy reflectance spectra, we would choose several relatively narrow (i.e., 30 nm or less) spectral bands in the green (550 nm), red (670 nm), "red edge" (720 nm), and the near-infrared (800 nm) to discriminate marijuana leaves and canopies from other species. Much of the leaf spectral information is also available in the canopy reflectance data. Published by Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

TI Measurements of glacier variation in the Tibetan Plateau using landsat

AB Glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau play an important role in the Earth's climate system. Because of high altitude and difficulties in access, regular, systematic surveys of glacier variation are almost impossible in some regions of the Tibetan Plateau. As a result, remote sensing is at present the primary, in many cases the only way to measure the state of glaciers. In combination with Geographic Information System (GIS), it provides an efficient tool to analyze the current state and changes in glaciers. We used a technique of integrated remote sensing and GIS to map and measure changes in glaciers using a 21-year series of Landsat images (from 1973 to 1994) and topographic maps of a study site on the Tibetan Plateau. The details of glacier fluctuation, such as area of glaciers and changes in the magnitude of recession or advance of a glacier terminus on different dates, are described based on the results of image analysis, including coregistration, classification, vector analysis, and area calculation. Within the study area, during the 21 years, it was determined that the northern glaciers advanced and the southern glaciers retreated, the average rate of change was 50 m a(-1) to 105 m a(-1). The results show that Landsat data provide an important source of information for studies of glacier variation. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1998.

AB A view-angle-dependent brightness gradient was observed in an AVIRIS image of a forested region in Oregon's Cascade Mountains. A method of removing the view-angle effect was sought that would not alter the radiometric integrity of the image, and which would require minimal ancillary information. Four methods were tested and evaluated in terms of remaining brightness gradient and in terms of retention of spectral characteristics. All methods used a quadratic fitting equation to model the changes in brightness across view angles. Other descriptive coefficients were calculated to aid in interpretation. The observed view-angle effect varied with wavelength in a manner consistent with predictions of bidirectional reflectance distribution function characteristics of vegetation. View-angle effects were determined to contain both additive and multiplicative components, with multiplicative components being strong in the chlorophyll absorption region. The view-angle effect in a given pixel was a function of both an underlying view-angle response determined by surface structure and the inherent brightness of that pixel. The most successful compensation method was the one that best accounted for broad differences between pixels in these two components. Despite the simplifying assumptions necessary for empirical view-angle correction techniques, they can still be useful for hyperspectral remote-sensing data in situations where the view-angle brightness variations would mask variance useful for extracting scene information.

AB Air temperature is an important descriptor of terrestrial environmental conditions across the earth. Standard meteorological observations generally provide reasonable descriptions of temporal variations in air temperature for the site sampled but may not describe the spatial heterogeneity typically encountered in this variable over larger land areas. If a reasonable estimate of spatial patterns of air temperature can be derived from satellite remote sensing, this pattern, in combination with the temporal precision of ground measurements, should significantly improve our knowledge of terrestrial environmental conditions.
   In this study, we explore a methodology for estimating air temperature directly from remotely sensed observations using the (observed) correlation between a spectral vegetation index and surface temperature (temperature-vegetation index). Inference of air temperature is based on the hypothesis that the bulk temperature of an infinitely thick vegetation canopy is close to ambient air temperature.
   Advanced very high resolution radiometer observations for five sites in northeastern Kansas were used to estimate air temperatures on 31 days during the 1987 growing season. These air temperature estimates were compared with coincident ground-measured air temperatures recorded at standard meteorological stations.
   A strong correlation (r=0.93) was found between the satellite estimates and measured air temperatures with a mean error of 2.92 C degrees. However, there was a consistent positive bias in the satellite estimates. It is not clear at this time whether the bias is due to an actual difference between air temperature and the temperature of an infinitely thick canopy or whether it is an artifact of the measurements themselves. Within the errors of the methods used, estimation of standard meteorological shelter height air temperatures recorded at the time of satellite overpass appears possible. Further refinements of the remote sensing methods used here are possible and can be expected in the era of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth Observing System.

AB In vivo florescence of chlorophyll a (chl a) was measured, with a ship-borne lidar (light detecting and ranging) system and with an in situ fluorometer and a laboratory spectrofluorometer, in a frontal region separating the runoff plume of the Gaspe' Current and marine waters of the Anticosti Gyre in the St. Lawrence Estuary, during daytime and nighttime. These fluorescence measurements were compared with extracted chl a concentrations from water samples. The results showed that lidar can produce accurate synoptic estimates of surface chl a concentrations. The lidar instrument measured a variable fluorescence intensity F, which lies between the ground (F-0) and maximum (F-m) fluorescence intensity of chl a. The slope of the linear regression of lidar F against extracted chl a was steeper and less variable during the night than during the day. Monitoring of all variables over a 24-h period showed that photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) np to 100 W m(-2) did not significantly reduce lidar fluorescence-that is, up to 90 min after sunrise under cloud-free conditions. In the context of lidar remote sensing from an aircraft, dawn flights will allow measurements of F that lie close to dark-adapted values and that are little affected by PAR. At this time of day, light conditions would be adequate for safe low-altitude flights. (C) Elsevier Science Inc., 1997.

AB High-reflectance patches are regularly observed off the southeastern coast of South America during the lat austral spring and summer in visible satellite imagery of the Coastal Zone Color Scanner (CZCS). Unfortunately, coincident in situ samples for identifying their cause are lacking. To ascertain the likelihood that these patches represent surface blooms of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi, their distribution pattern was mapped and their spectral signature evaluated by classifying CZCS imagery with a supervised, multispectral classification scheme that had been developed to detect this phytoplankton species. On the basis of the similarity of these characteristics to those of documented cases, we conclude that the high-reflectance patches observed in surface waters of the shelf and beyond are E. huxleyi blooms. The blooms seasonally occupied an area as large as 550,000 km(2). Standing stock estimates indicate that the detected blooms produce an average of 1.5-4.9X10(5) metric tons of calcite carbon and 4.0X10(3) t of dimethyl sulfide sulfur. The bloom's production of these climatically relevant compounds and their alteration of optical properties in the surface layer suggest that the blooms significantly affect the biogeochemistry and ecology of this region.

AB Most animals use a ''green'' spectral range to remotely sense the presence and vitality of vegetation. While humans possess the same ability in their eyes, man-made space-borne sensors that sense evolution of global vegetation, have so far used a combination of the red and near infrared channels instead. In this article we challenge this approach, using measurements of reflectance spectra from 400 nm to 750 nm with spectral resolution of 2 nm, with simultaneous determination of pigment concentrations of mature and autumn senescing leaves. We show that, for a wide range of leaf greenness, the maximum sensitivity of reflectance coincides with the red absorption maximum of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) at 670 nm. However for yellow-green to green leaves (with Chl-a more than 3-5 mu g/cm(2)), the reflectance near 670 nm is not sensitive to chlorophyll concentration because of saturation of the relationship of absorptions versus chlorophyll concentration. Maximum sensitivity of Chl-a concentration for a wide range of its variation (0.3-45 mu g/cm(2)) was found, not surprisingly so, around the green band from 520 nm to 630 nm and also near 700 nm. We found that the inverse of the reflectance in the green band was proportional to Chl-a concentration with correlation r(2) > 0.95. This band will be present on several future satellite sensors with a global view of vegetation (SeaWiFS to be launched in. 1996, Polder on ADEOS-1 also in 1996, and MODIS on EOS in 1998 and 2000). New indexes that use the green channel and are resistant to atmospheric effects are developed. A green NDVI = (rho(nir) - rho(green)/(rho(nir) + rho(green) was tested for a range of Chl-a from 0.3 mu g/cm(2) to 45 mu g/cm(2), and found to have an error in the chlorophyll a derivation at leaf level of less than 3 mu g/cm(2). The new index has wider dynamic range than the NDVI and is, on average, at least five times more sensitive to Chl-a concentration. A green atmospherically resistant vegetation index (GARI), tailored on the concept of ARVI (Kaufman and Tanre, 1992), is developed and is expected to be as resistant to atmospheric effects as ARVI but more sensitive to a wide range of Chl-a concentrations. While NDVI and ARVI are sensitive to vegetation fraction and to rate of absorption of photosynthetic solar radiation, a green vegetation index like GARI should be added to sense the concentration of chlorophyll, to measure the rate of photosynthesis and to monitor plant stress.

AB Thanks to its optical design, the airborne POLDER instrument allows a multidirectional measurement of the surface reflectance. During the ''La Crau 91'' experiment, the radiometer has been flying over a study area of 10 km x 10 km composed of various cultivated fields. The measurements have been registered on a regular grid of resolution 100 m. For each grid point, up to 50 directional measurements provide an adequate description of the surface reflectance directional signature. These signatures are discussed for a few selected targets representative of the area. The measurements show typical features of the reflectance angular signature, including the ''hot spot'' and specular reflection. The quality of the measurements is shown to be satisfactory. A simple directional model is then applied to the measurements. It provides, for each of the 10(4) grid points, a normalized reflectance corrected for the angular effects, together with two parameters that give a quantitative assessment of the directional signature. The article discusses these parameters and the ability of the model to represent the measurements. Some spatial structure of directional signature is apparent in the study area and is consistent with a band use map of this area. The squared correlation coefficient R(2) Of the fit between model and observations is larger than 0.8 for 50% of the area and smaller than. 0.5 for about 20% of it at 550 nm and 850 nm. The part of the area for which the model is not satisfactory corresponds primarily to pixels with a larger specular reflection signal or with few directional measurements. Angular signatures of reflectances are measured here at the regional scale, a key step for the preparation of the operational processing of spaceborne POLDER measurements at the global scale.

AB The empirical study reported in this article focused on the relationships between vegetation properties and reflectance measured on a corn canopy throughout its phenological evolution by means of a truck-mounted spectroradiometer. The objective was to produce relationships between spectral indices [such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the wavelength of the red edge] and biophysical parameters, such as leaf area index (LAI) and biomass, which should be useful for corn studies from remotely sensed data. The NDVI and the red-edge position were both found useful to describe some phenological stages for a corn canopy, because they both correlated statistically significantly with biophysical parameters, such as LAI and bio mass. Coefficients of determination (r(2)) for the various relationships ranged from 0.94 to 0.98: however, leaf area index could be best estimated from NDVI by exponential equations, and biomass from the wavelength of the red edge by logarithmic equations.

AB This article describes an electromagnetic model which simulates the microwave polarimetric backscatter of agricultural fields. The model is based on radiative transfer theory and solves the relevant equation by means of a numerical algorithm, namely matrix doubling, which includes multiple scattering effects. The backscatter coefficient may be simulated for any pair of incidence and scattering elliptical polarizations; also, the phase difference between VV and HH channels is computed. Model simulations are compared with experimental results obtained at L band (1.2 GHz) by the NASA-JPL AIRSAR, in the framework of the MAC Europe '91 campaign, over sunflower fields belonging to an Italian site named Montespertoli. A satisfactory agreement is observed between predicted and measured polarimetric quantities of vegetated fields, while for bare soils (particularly at VV polarization) backscatter coefficients are overestimated, due to inaccuracies of surface models available at present.

AB There has been a great deal of interest in estimation of terrestrial biophysical parameters such as vegetation with remotely sensed data. Quantitative estimation of vegetation properties with existing algorithms has been based on empirical relationships established by simple regression. The problem in applying these empirical relationships is that those coefficients proposed vary with vegetation type. To investigate the possible development of an algorithm to quantitatively estimate vegetation properties independent of vegetation type, a model-to-model approach is proposed. This approach first inverts a simple bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model with limited data points and simulates multidirectional data. The simulated data are then used in the inversion of a physically based BRDF model to estimate vegetation optical properties (leaf reflectance and transmittance) and leaf area index (LAI). This approach is validated with data collected from three experiments conducted in cotton, alfalfa, wheat, and pecan fields. A sensitivity analysis and demonstration with multitemporal remote sensing data were performed, and the results shaw that estimated LAI values agree well with field observations and there is a potential in applying this approach an an operational basis in practice with multitemporal remote sensing data.

TI A MICROWAVE POLARIMETRIC SCATTERING MODEL FOR FOREST CANOPIES BASED ON
   VECTOR RADIATIVE-TRANSFER THEORY
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID VEGETATION; SIGNATURE; LAYER
AB A microwave polarimetric scattering model for a forest canopy is developed based on the iterative solution of the vector radiative transfer equations up to the second order. The forest canopy constituents (branches, leaves, stems, and trunks) are embedded in a multi-layered medium over a rough interface. The branches, stems, and trunks are modeled as finite randomly oriented cylinders. Deciduous leaves are modeled as randomly oriented discs and coniferous leaves are modeled as randomly oriented needles. The vector radiative transfer equations contain nondiagonal extinction matrices that account for the difference in propagation constants and the attenuation rates between the vertical and horizontal polarizations. For a plane wave exciting the canopy, the average Mueller matrix is formulated, and then used to determine the linearly polarized backscattering coefficients including both the copolarized and cross-polarized power returns. Comparisons of the model with measurements from Les Landes Forest of France showed good agreements over a wide frequency band and gave a quantitative understanding of the relation between the backscattering coefficients and the age of the trees in the forest and forest biomass.

TI CLASSIFICATION OF MULTISPECTRAL IMAGES BASED ON FRACTIONS OF ENDMEMBERS

DT Article
ID VEGETATION; ABUNDANCE; DESERTS
AB Four time-sequential Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images of an area of Amazon forest, Pasture, and second growth near Manaus, Brazil were classified according to dominant ground cover, using a new technique based on fractions of spectral endmembers.  A simple four-endmember model consisting of reflectance spectra of green vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation, soil, and shade was applied to all four images. Fractions of endmembers were used to define seven categories, each of which consisted of one or more classes of ground cover, where class names were based on field observations. Endmember fractions varied over time for many pixels, reflecting processes operating on the ground such as felling of forest, or regrowth of vegetation in previously cleared areas. Changes in classes over time were used to establish superclasses which grouped pixels having common histories. sources of classification error were evaluated, including system noise, endmember variability, and low spectral contrast. Field work during each of the four years showed consistently high accuracy in per-image classification. Classification accuracy in any one year was improved by considering the multiyear context. Although the method was tested in the Amazon basin, the results suggest that endmember classification may be generally useful for comparing multispectral images in space and time.

SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

DT Article
ID FIELD
AB High spectral resolution remote sensing devices are frequently used to quantify the flux Of energy reflected from or transmitted through an optical medium. Their use requires careful calibration against a well-characterized standard. This study teas conducted to characterize temperature sensitivity of a typical silicon-detector-based spectroradiometer, demonstrate the potential errors due to temperature effects, and present a methodology to correct for temperature-induced errors. Three Spectron Engineering SE590 units were independently evaluated under varying temperatures at three separate institutions. A procedure for correcting calibration coefficients (radiance/count) as a function of temperature and wavelength teas developed and applied. The Evaluation showed that at wavelengths between 390 nm and 940 nm the calibration coefficients differed from each other by less than 5% among all ambient temperatures. At 1000 nm, the calibration coefficient decreases about 5% going from 25 degrees C to 35 degrees C and increases about 25% going from 25 degrees C to 0 degrees C. Wavebands below 390 nm responded chaotically to temperature. At ant! given wavelength above 940 nm the change in calibration coefficient value was a nearly linear function of temperature, an indication that a simple temperature correction can be applied. Calibration coefficients were linearly interpolated for each waveband greater than 940 nm at temperatures between temperature extremes imposed upon the instruments during the experiments. Linearly interpolated calibration coefficients were found to be within 4% of actual values. Users of silicon-detector-based spectroradiometers should be aware of potential errors in data due to temperature effects.

AB The ISLSCP Workshop was held in Columbia Maryland, 23-26 June 1992 with over 240 scientists and science managers attending. The goal was to assess the progress of the East decade in the areas of modeling, satellite data algorithm development, and field experiments. This article includes:
   1. A review of the state and direction of biosphere-atmosphere model development and an assessment of the data needs of the models. Models covering a large range of timescales were considered: energy-water-carbon (seconds to seasons); carbon cycles and biogeochemistry (days to years); and ecological structure and function (years to millennia).
   2. A reference to current satellite data algorithms and other global data sources. The areas covered in the workshop were: near-surface meteorology, surface radiation budget, precipitation, runoff; snow and ice, soils and soil moisture, and land cover type and land cover attributes. These are discussed in detail in other articles in this issue.
   3. A review of completed and planned major field experiments. The major experiments of the last decade are summarized and the lessons noted, The participating scientists agreed on the need to rapidly assemble and circulate global data sets of variables and parameters required to initialize, force, and validate the global biosphere-atmosphere models. A prioritized list of data sets required to meet this need is set out and discussed. Lastly, initiatives taken by ISLSCP to satisfy these requirements are reviewed:
   Initiative I: Immediate Generation of High Priority Global Data Sets
   Some essential global data sets are to be put together within 2 years and released to the community by mid-1994. These data sets will be mapped to a common spatial resolution (1 degrees x 1 degrees) and will cover the period 1987-1988.
   1. Vegetation: Global sets of vegetation-related parameters are to be generated with a monthly time resolution. Available AVHRR data sets are to be I used as the basis for this effort, and algorithms will be applied to calculate fields of cover type, phenology, FPAR, and leaf area index. These fields can then in turn be used to infer other surface pa rameters such as roughness, albedo, biomass, etc.
   2. Hydrometeorology: Global meteorological fields retrieved from numerical reanalysis will be manipulated to provide near-surface forcing data sets for temperature, humidity, windspeed, etc. Observations of precipitation, runoff, and snow cover are to be worked up into easily accessible forms.
   3. Radiation Budget: A closer interface with the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and related projects will be pursued to obtain surface radiation budget components at higher spatial resolutions, as well as fields of incident PAR.
   4. Soils: A small project was set in place with the goal of providing a useful soil type and properties data set for use by global modelers.
   Initiative II: Improved, Follow-on Data Sets
   The data sets specified in Initiative I are to be generated within a e-year period. However, it is clear that great improvements could be made over this first data release which must rely on pre-existing data sets and robust, available algorithms. Work was started to scope out what needs to be done to produce improved versions of all the Initiative I data sets within 5 years, by mid-1997.
   Initiative III: Improved Communications within the Land Science Community
   Future discussions within ISLSCP and between ISLSCP and other bodies will focus on the need to coordinate different research thrusts within the land science community, particularly the modeling, algorithm and field experiment work.

AB In digital satellite imagery, small fragments of woody vegetation are difficult to detect because they frequently are smaller than the pixel size and are mixed with other land cover classes. A method for detecting subpixel woody vegetation, which analyzes mixture phenomena at the individual pixel level, is presented. This method relies on a moving window to collect training sets for adjacent land cover. In order to locate pixels of interest and to decrease noise, image-derived masks are integrated with the original digital imagery in a geocoded information system. A rule-based scheme is employed to organize relative spatial and spectral information into classification decision procedures. Tests using simulated multispectral and panchromatic SPOT HRV imagery of lowland Britain have shown that the developed method discriminates significantly more woody vegetation than standard multispectral classification.

ID CLASSIFICATION; SEGMENTATION
AB Estimates of mean tree size and cover for each forest stand from an invertible forest canopy reflectance model are part of a new forest vegetation mapping system. Image segmentation defines stands which are sorted into general growth forms using per-pixel image classifications. Ecological models based on terrain relations predict species associations for the conifer, hardwood, and brush growth forms. The combination of the model-based estimates of tree size and cover with species associations yields general-purpose vegetation maps useful for a variety of land management needs. Results of timber inventories in the Tahoe and Stanislaus National Forests indicate the vegetation maps form a useful basis for stratification. Patterns in timber volumes for the strata reveal that the cover estimates are more reliable than the tree size estimates. A map accuracy assessment of the Stanislaus National Forest shows high overall map accuracy and also illustrates the problems in estimating tree size.

AB The importance of remote sensing of lake area and level changes for climate research, particularly for closed lakes in semiarid regions, is noted, and the initial need for simultaneous measurement of level and area is discussed. The European Space Agency's ERS-1 satellite is uniquely suited to the latter task, carrying a radar altimeter and the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR), the latter providing regular global repeat coverage ad 1 km resolution for the first time. The accuracy of two area measurement algorithms are assessed using simulated coarse resolution (approximate to 1 km) data for a semiarid closed lake, and one of them is shown to be capable of retrieving an area of 133 km(2) to 1%. Results are presented using data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument (similar to ATSR), showing the measured area of a small (approximate to 140 km(2)) climatically sensitive lake over a 5-year period, that display significant interannual variability that can be correlated with climate. In addition, it is shown that the sensitivity of a closed lake to changes in catchment basin precipitation is increased if its inflow is derived from the outflow of an open lake.

AB The leaf optical model PROSPECT by Jacquemoud and Baret (1990), the soil reflectance spectrum representation with basis functions by Price (1990), and the skylight ratio spectral representation by McCartney (1978) have been integrated into Kuusk's (1994) fast canopy reflectance model. The resulting new multispectral canopy reflectance model describes the directional reflectance of a homogeneous vegetation canopy over 400-2500 nm with a high spectral resolution. The number of the input parameters of the model does not depend on the number of spectral bands used. The model has high computational efficiency, and thus it can rather easily be inverted to determine the vegetation parameters from remote optical measurements. The model is tested with the corn and soybean reflectance data of Ranson et al. (1984; 1985).

AB The process of old growth conservation would be greatly facilitated if remote sensing could be used to locate America's few remaining old growth forests. The use of multispectral remote sensing in the identification of old growth has been largely confined to efforts in the Pacific Northwest. The purpose of this study was to determine which image processing techniques best discriminate between old growth and younger spruce-fir stands in the southern Rocky Mountains. Various image processing techniques were applied to TM imagery of the Marvine Lakes valley in the Colorado White River National Forest. The study focused on two major structural differences between the forest types. 1) multistoried (old growth) vs. single-storied (young growth) canopies and 2) higher frequency of standing dead in old growth. Field measurements of photosynthetically active radiation confirmed the hypothesis that old growth canopies contain more gaps than the young post-fire stands. Texture analysis, color-ratio techniques, and vegetation indices successfully identified old growth. Evaluation of the success of old growth identification within a geographic information system suggested that digital per-pixel classification was inferior to visual interpretation. Spatial and spectral methods must be used in combination if structurally variable old growth forests are to be detected.

TI USE OF SPECTRAL ANALOGY TO EVALUATE CANOPY REFLECTANCE SENSITIVITY TO
   LEAF OPTICAL-PROPERTIES
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SCATTERING; MODEL
AB The spectral variation Of canopy reflectance is mostly governed by the optical properties of the elements such as the leaves. Since leaf intrinsic scattering properties show very little spectral variation, leaf optical properties are related to their absorption properties. Spectral analogies are thus observed between two wavelengths for which the optical properties (absorption, reflectance, or transmittance) of the elements are similar. The red edge for green plants shows the full range of variation of leaf optical properties. The relationship between canopy reflectance and leaf reflectance measured concurrently at the red edge over sugar beet canopies was thus used to simulate canopy reflectance over the whole spectral domain from leaf reflectance spectra measured over the whole spectral domain. The results show that the spectral analogies found allows accurate reconstruction of canopy reflectance spectra. Explicit assumptions about the very low spectral variation of leaf intrinsic scattering properties are thus indirectly justified. The sensitivity of canopy reflectance (rho(c)) to leaf optical properties is then investigated from concurrent spectral variations Of canopy (partial derivative rho(c)/partial derivative lambda) and leaf reflectance (partial derivative rho1/partial derivative lambda): partial derivative rho(c)/partial derivative rho1 = (partial derivative rho(c)/partial derivative lambda) (partial derivative rho(l)/partial derivative lambda)-1. This expression is strictly valid only when the optical properties of the soil background or of the other vegetation elements such as bark are either spectrally flat or do not contribute significantly to canopy reflectance.  Simulations using the SAIL and PROSPECT models demonstrate that the sensitivity of canopy reflectance to leaf reflectance is significant for large vegetation cover fractions in spectral domains where absorption is low. In these conditions, multiple scattering enhances the leaf absorption features by a factor that can be greater than 2.0. To override the limitations of the SAIL model for the description of the canopy architecture, we tested the previous simulation results on experimental data. Concurrent canopy and leaf reflectance spectra were measured for a range of sugar beet canopies. The results show good agreement with the theoretical findings. Conclusions are drawn about the applicability of these findings, with particular attention to the potential detectability of leaf biochemical composition from canopy reflectance sensed from space.

DT Article
ID ATMOSPHERIC WATER-VAPOR; SPECTRAL EMISSIVITY; SATELLITE; TEMPERATURE
AB A method for estimating the difference between the channel emissivities in NOAA-AVHRR Channels 4 and 5 is proposed and applied to a data set from the HAPEX-MOBILHY experiment. The method is based on the separation between the atmospheric and emissivity effects in the brightness temperature difference measured with AVHRR Channels 4 and 5. Atmospheric profiles coincident to the satellite overpass and a radiative transfer model are required to estimate the atmospheric correction for brightness temperatures. With this procedure, the emissivity difference DELTAepsilon is obtained at the satellite spatial and spectral resolution, which has a great interest for correcting thermal images with the split-window technique. The order of magnitude of the error related to the method proposed has been estimated by means of a sensitivity analysis to be better than 0.005.

AB The invertibility of an accurate discrete ordinates canopy reflectance model is investigated through a series of experiments. Effects of different canopy types, noise levels, spectral ranges, and sampling geometries [including the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and the proposed Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) satellite sampling schemes] are considered. Both error-free synthetic bidirectional reflectance data and empirical field reflectance data are utilized. Results suggest that the model can retrieve soil and canopy parameters with reasonable accuracy in most cases, and surface state parameters (absorbed radiation, spectral albedo and photosynthetic efficiency) with high accuracy in all cases. The efficiency of several commonly used optimization algorithms is also assessed, and a model sensitivity study is conducted.

AB In November 1989 the EUREKA project LASFLEUR (EU 380) started as an European research effort to investigate the future application of far-field laser-induced plant fluorescence for synoptic, airborne environmental monitoring of vegetation. This report includes a brief introduction in a theoretically approach for the laser-induced fluorescence signals of leaves and their spectral and radiometric behaviour. In addition, a detailed description of the design and realization of the second generation of the far-field fluorescence lidar (DLidaR-2) is given with special regard to the optical and electronical setup, followed by a short explanation of the data processing. The main objectives of the far-field measurements are to demonstrate the link between laser-induced fluorescence data and plant physiology and to show the reliability Of remote single shot lidar measurements. The data sets include the typical daily cycles of the fluorescence for different global irradiation. As expected from biophysical models, the remotely sensed chlorophyll fluorescence is highly correlated with the carbon fixation rate, while the fluorescence ratio F685/F730 is only dependent on the chlorophyll concentration. Drought stress measurement of evergreen oaks Quercus pubescens confirm the findings of healthy plants with regard to the fluorescence ratio F685/F730 while the fluorescence signals of stressed plants show a different behavior than nonstressed plants. Additionally, the corresponding physiological data (porometer and PAM data) are presented.

TI APPLICATION OF IMAGE CROSS-CORRELATION TO THE MEASUREMENT OF GLACIER
   VELOCITY USING SATELLITE IMAGE DATA
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID ICE
AB Image-to-image cross-correlation software is applied to pairs of digital satellite images to map the velocity field of moving ice. This technique uses small-scale glacial surface features, such as crevasse scars and snow dunes, as markers on the surface of the moving ice. Displacements of the surface features are mapped by selecting small image areas centered on distinct features, or by dividing a large area of densely featured glacial surface into a grid of areas, and searching a subsequent image for matching areas using a cross-correlation algorithm. Interpolation of the peak correlation values allows the displacements to be measured to subpixel accuracy, resulting in very precise velocity measurements. Cross-correlation is also applied to provide image coregistration in areas devoid of bedrock exposures. In such areas, subtle large-scale topographic undulations in the ice surface, related to underlying bedrock structure, may be correlated by using large image areas and low-pass filtered images. Both types of applications are demonstrated, using Ice Stream D and Ice Stream E in West Antarctica as test areas. A high-resolution map of the velocity field of the central portion of Ice Stream E, generated by the displacement-measuring technique, is presented. The use of cross-correlation software is a significant improvement over previous manually-based photogrammetric methods for velocity measurement, and is far more cost-effective than in situ methods in remote polar areas.

TI THE USE OF REMOTELY SENSED DATA IN ESTIMATION OF PAR USE EFFICIENCY AND
   BIOMASS PRODUCTION OF FLOODED RICE
SO REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID PHOTOSYNTHETICALLY ACTIVE RADIATION; SPECTRAL REFLECTANCE
AB A model of biomass production for flooded rice crops is proposed based on an energetic yield approach, in which PAR interception efficiency is estimated from vegetation index calculated from canopy reflectances at visible and near-infrared wavelengths.  The relationship between interception efficiency (measured from hemispherical photographs) and the vegetation index results from coupling reflectance and PAR interception models based on the Beer-Lambert extinction law.  This relationship does not depend explicitly on the canopy structure parameters but it assumes that the background reflectance is known.  Although the background reflectance depends on the water state and depth variation in a way which cannot be explicitly quantified, it has been empirically described by its observed evolution fitted with time.  After anthesis, this reflectance takes into account the reflectance of the senescent vegetation.  Given the spectral profile of a crop (temporal evolution of its reflectance), its PAR absorption profile can be estimated.  The PAR use efficiency (conversion of the absorbed energy into biomass) is then determined for every phenological period as the ratio of total absorbed PAR to total synthetized biomass during the period.  For flooded rice, root extraction and therefore root biomass evaluation are rather easy, so that more realistic PAR use efficiencies can be estimated than for most crops.  The obtained values for these efficiencies agree with those of the literature.  Observed varietal differences agree with independent experimental evaluation of cultivar photosynthetic capabilities.

ID MULTISPECTRAL DATA; COMBINATIONS; IMAGES
AB Landsat TM images, field data, and laboratory reflectance spectra were examined for the Kelso dunes, Mojave Desert, California to assess the use of visible and near-infrared (VNIR) remote sensing data to discriminate aeolian sand populations on the basis of spectral brightness.  Results show that areas of inactive sand have a larger percentage of dark, fine-grained materials compared to those composed of active sand, which contain less dark fines and a higher percentage of quartz sand-size grains.  Both areas are spectrally distinct in the VNIR, suggesting that VNIR spectral data can be used to discriminate active and inactive sand populations in the Mojave Desert.  Analysis of laboratory spectra was complicated by the presence of magnetite in the active sands, which decreases their laboratory reflectance values to those of inactive sands.  For this application, comparison of TM and laboratory spectra suggests that less than 35% vegetation cover does not influence the TM spectra.

AB The potential of computing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) measurements from the global, daily observations collected by the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) has created great interest in the use of these data sets to study global biospheric dynamics.  Initial qualitative studies demonstrated this potential but the move to quantitative assessments is hindered by limited understanding of the performance characteristics of the AVHRR observations relative to surface vegetation conditions.  Factors related to instrument precision and calibration, atmospheric attenuation and off-nadir viewing create deviations of the NDVI observations unrelated to vegetation dynamics.  Deviations in excess of 50% between the satellite and equivalent ground observations are possible if no effort is made to account for these effects.  In addition, off-nadir viewing causes spatio-temporal variations in the measurements and cloud occurrence reduces temporal resolution below the AVHRR's daily repeat cycle.  It appears possible to reduce these errors to approximately +/- 10% (+/- 0.1 NDVI) with at least a monthly time resolution if all of the observation attributes are addressed adequately.  Much of the remaining error resides in atmospheric variability, uncertainties in off-nadir views and loss of sensor precision of large solar zenith angles.  A global measure of vegetation green foliage dynamics with a measurement precision of +/- 10% and a monthly time resolution may not yet meet the exacting needs of some biospheric modelers, but it is, in fact, remarkable, considering that this possibility was not even conceived when the AVHRR was designed.  Further refinement of global remotely sensed vegetation foliage measurement precision appears possible and should be the primary focus for terrestrial remote sensing research in the next decade.

AB PROSPECT is a radiative transfer model based on Allen's generalized "plate model" that represents the optical properties of plant leaves from 400 nm to 2500 nm.  Scattering is described by a spectral refractive index (n) and a parameter characterizing the leaf mesophyll structure (N).  Absorption is modeled using pigment concentration (C(a+b)), water content (C(w)), and the corresponding specific spectral absorption coefficients (K(a+b) and K(w)).  The parameters n, K(a+b), and K(w) have been fitted using experimental data corresponding to a wide range of plant types and status.  PROSPECT has been tested successfully on independent data sets.  It inversion allows one to reconstruct, with reasonable accuracy, leaf reflectance, and transmittance features in the 400-2500 nm range by adjusting the three input variables N, C(a+b), and C(w).
