AB BackgroundMedical errors (MEs) significantly threaten patient safety
   globally. This study aimed to explore multidimensional factors
   associated with self-reported MEs among Chinese physicians and
   nurses.MethodsA cross-sectional online survey using snowball sampling
   collected 7197 valid responses from Chinese physicians and nurses
   between October 2020 and April 2022. A self-reported question assessed
   MEs within the past three months. Sociodemographic characteristics,
   work-related factors, and mental distress were collected. Data were
   analyzed using stepwise logistic regression.Results1285 (17.9%)
   physicians and nurses self-reported MEs during the previous 3 months.
   Factors associated with higher odds of self-reported MEs included male
   sex (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.23-1.69), physician status (OR: 1.48, 95% CI:
   1.26-1.73), history of mental illness (OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.16-1.91),
   longer weekly working hours (OR: 1.20-1.23, 95% CI: 1.03-1.47),
   workplace violence experience (OR: 1.54-1.75, 95% CI: 1.30-2.17), and
   dissatisfaction with the medical practice environment (OR: 1.20, 95% CI:
   1.05-1.37). Conversely, being married (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.62-0.89),
   holding a bachelor's degree or higher (OR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97), and
   having more years of professional practice (OR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95-0.97)
   were associated with lower odds of self-reported MEs. Self-reported MEs
   were significantly and positively correlated with burnout (OR: 1.40, 95%
   CI: 1.20-1.62), depressive symptoms (OR: 1.38-1.45, 95% CI: 1.04-1.84),
   perceived stress (OR: 1.28-1.62, 95% CI: 1.06-2.02), and excessive
   daytime sleepiness (OR: 1.27-1.46, 95% CI:
   1.10-1.79).ConclusionsSelf-reported MEs are relatively common among
   Chinese physicians and nurses, and are associated with various factors.
   Poor workplace conditions and mental distress are linked to an increased
   risk of MEs. Implementing effective interventions to improve workplace
   conditions and mental health is crucial for reducing MEs.

AB BackgroundRelapsed/Refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
   (DLBCL) represents a subgroup with a high incidence and dismal
   prognosis. Currently, there is a lack of robust models for predicting
   R/R DLBCL. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective study to identify key
   determinants to be incorporated into a novel nomogram to enhance the
   identification of DLBCL patients at elevated risk of
   refractoriness/recurrence.MethodsWe included 293 newly-diagnosed DLBCL
   patients from Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, collected from
   2008-2017. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n =
   206) and a validation cohort (n = 87) at a 7:3 ratio. The training
   cohort underwent univariable analysis to select variables for a binary
   logistic regression model. These variables were also prioritized using a
   random forest algorithm. The developed nomogram was evaluated with the
   receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and
   decision curve analysis (DCA) for its clinical
   utility.ResultsUnivariable analysis pinpointed several factors
   significantly associated with refractoriness/recurrence, including
   pathological subtype, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), International
   Prognostic Index (IPI), treatment, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC),
   lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI).
   Binary logistic regression highlighted pathological subtype, LDH,
   treatment, and ALC as key predictors, which were incorporated into the
   nomogram. The nomogram showed excellent calibration and accuracy in both
   cohorts, and comparative DCA and ROC analysis demonstrated its superior
   net benefit and area under the curve (AUC) compared to traditional
   indexes like IPI, R-IPI, and NCCN-IPI.ConclusionThis nomogram serves as
   a valuable tool for predicting the likelihood of refractoriness or
   recurrence in DLBCL patients.

AB Individuals with various health conditions or illnesses may require
   different therapeutic interventions to restore total or partial
   functioning. In low-and middle-income countries, mainly in the global
   South, these therapeutic options may not be widely available, or
   alternatively, may be unaffordable and unattainable for the majority of
   the population. This inequitable health situation necessitates
   cost-effective interventions that will be accessible and sustainable in
   developing societies. Hence, the consideration and use of clay, as an
   earthy malleable material is an economical and sustainable alternative
   as a therapeutic medium. The potential and boundaries of clay in the
   area of therapy are the focus of this paper. Clay palm press (CPP) is an
   unusual method of clay manipulation used in creating a medium for
   ceramic art exploration. It has been established to have benefits in
   remedying an individual's medical condition, specifically in
   strengthening weak muscles of the fingers and palms. Secondly, it
   enables the individual to create art from clay. From the primary purpose
   of healing, artistic expression has been generated. Moreover, it has
   various benefits in low-resource settings, and is accessible in rural
   areas, which affirms its use as a sustainable and economically viable
   therapeutic option for developing countries.

AB Aims: To compare all-cause and Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related
   healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) by cognitive stage. Methods and
   materials: This retrospective study analyzed insurance claims data
   linked to electronic health records (01/01/2015-12/31/2021). Patients
   with >= 1 cognitive assessment (Mini-Mental State Examination or
   Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and >= 1 medical or pharmacy claim for an
   AD diagnosis or AD medications were included. Inverse probability of
   treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to address potential confounding.
   All-cause and AD-related HCRU were summarized per patient per year
   (PPPY) and compared between early AD and advanced AD cohorts (defined
   according to cognitive scores) using generalized linear regression
   models; adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs), and 95% confidence
   intervals (CI) were reported. Results: A total of 193 patients were
   included (median age: 82 years; 63.2% female), 108 with early AD and 85
   with advanced AD, with similar mean follow up. All-cause HCRU, on
   average, was similar between early AD and advanced AD cohorts (37.4 PPPY
   and 38.9 encounters PPPY, respectively). For AD-related HCRU, patients
   with early AD had fewer encounters PPPY, on average, than patients with
   advanced AD (1.26 and 3.88 encounters, respectively). Following IPTW
   adjustment, the advanced AD cohort had significantly higher overall
   AD-related HCRU (IRR: 3.64 [95% CI: 1.96-6.75], p < 0.001) and
   outpatient visits (IRR: 2.76 [95% CI: 1.68-4.54], p < 0.001) compared to
   the early AD cohort. Limitations: The relatively small sample size of
   patients with linked claims and cognitive score data limited the ability
   to assess contribution of all encounter types to HCRU trends, as well as
   generalizability to the broader AD population. Conclusions: Although
   all-cause HCRU was similar, patients with advanced AD incurred higher
   AD-related HCRU compared to patients living with early AD. Further
   research is needed to determine whether interventions earlier in disease
   progression can mitigate the AD-related healthcare burden for patients
   with advanced AD. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the
   main cause of dementia in older adults in the United States. Beyond the
   clinical challenges faced by patients with AD, the burden of healthcare
   resource utilization (HCRU) from different types of healthcare visits
   and interactions are significant. However, differences in HCRU burden
   between patients with early and advanced AD is not well studied. We
   conducted a study using insurance claims data linked to electronic
   health records to compare all-cause and AD-related HCRU between patients
   with early and advanced AD. A total of 108 patients with early AD and 85
   patients with advanced AD were included. There was no statistically
   significant difference in all-cause HCRU between the groups which may
   reflect changing patterns of healthcare interactions as AD progresses.
   However, patients with advanced AD incurred significantly higher HCRU
   related to their underlying AD, on average 3.64 times more frequent
   healthcare encounters of any type compared to patients living with early
   AD. This was driven by higher rates of AD-related outpatient visits
   among the advanced AD cohort. The significantly higher AD-related HCRU
   in patients with advanced AD, compared to those in the early stages,
   highlights the potential for disease-modifying treatments administered
   earlier in the disease course to significantly reduce the associated
   healthcare burden.

AB Objective: This study aims to investigate the risk factors for severe
   postpartum hemorrhage (SPPH) in patients with placenta accreta spectrum
   (PAS) undergoing cesarean delivery, despite the prophylactic use of
   resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA).
   Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study
   on PAS patients who underwent cesarean delivery with prophylactic REBOA
   at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from
   January 2017 to December 2021. Prophylactic REBOA placement was
   determined by a prenatal ultrasound scoring system. Patients were
   divided into those who experienced SPPH (case group) and those who did
   not (control group), with SPPH defined by one or a combination of the
   following criteria: intraoperative blood loss >= 1500 mL, transfusion of
   >= 4 units of packed red blood cells, intraoperative hysterectomy, or
   sequential uterine artery embolization. Propensity score matching (PSM)
   was employed to minimize biases, and multivariate logistic regression
   was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for risk factors.
   Results: Of the 424 enrolled patients, 102 experienced SPPH (case
   group), while 322 did not (control group). After PSM, the case group
   comprised 79 patients, and the control group included 130. After
   adjusting for confounders, patients with placenta increta (aOR 3, 95% CI
   1.49-6.03, p = 0.002), percreta (aOR 21.77, 95% CI 6.57-72.09, p <
   0.001), lower hemoglobin levels (aOR 0.98, 95% CI 0.95-1, p = 0.050),
   and higher D-dimer levels (aOR 1.36, 95% CI 1.12-1.65, p = 0.002) had an
   elevated risk of SPPH. Threshold effect analysis indicated no
   significant nonlinear relationship between hemoglobin, D-dimer, and
   outcomes. Conclusions: PAS patients, particularly those with placenta
   increta and percreta, lower hemoglobin levels, and elevated D-dimer
   levels, are at an increased risk of SPPH during cesarean delivery, even
   with REBOA intervention.

AB Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an extremely heterogenous
   autoimmune disorder. A key biomarker, the double stranded (ds) DNA
   autoantibody, provides diagnostic specificity for SLE. We analyzed
   anti-dsDNA by mass spectrometry (MS) to determine if ascertaining the
   autoantibody's heavy chain variable region (IGHV) may hold any clinical
   relevance. A cross-sectional study of 32 SLE patients (75% female) in a
   single center was performed. Serum anti-dsDNA was subjected to MS
   analyses. Obtained IGHV subfamilies were correlated with active clinical
   features of SLE, as determined by medical record reviews. We established
   significant associations with the presence of IGHV3-15 and active
   neuropsychiatric lupus (relative risk [RR] 5.71); IGHV3-21, IGHV3-23 and
   IGHV4-34 and leukopenia (RR 13.70, 2.14 and 10.29 respectively); and
   IGHV3-23 and serositis (RR 2.41) and cutaneous lesions (RR 2.82). This
   study provides the first evidence for the clinical benefits of deep
   anti-dsDNA profiling through MS, and provides an avenue for improving
   predictive medicine for SLE patients. Future studies with a greater
   number of patients, and to determine if these subfamilies have direct
   pathogenic properties are required.

AB PurposeNeoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has proven valuable in treating
   locally advanced colon cancer (LACC) and is included as a treatment
   option for patients with clinical T4b colon cancer by the National
   Comprehensive Cancer Network. However, the long-term survival benefit of
   NAC in LACC remains debated, due to a lack of conclusive clinical trial
   results identifying the patients who would benefit most from NAC. This
   study aimed to assess the efficacy of NAC in patients with LACC based on
   histological subtype.Patients and methodsThis retrospective study
   analyzed 3,709 patients with LACC who underwent curative resection at
   Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital between 2014 and 2018.
   Patients were grouped into two groups: neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)
   and adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) groups. Propensity score matching (PSM)
   was used to adjust for confounders, and survival outcomes of the two
   groups across different histological subtypes were evaluated using
   Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves and log-rank tests.ResultsPatients with
   non-mucinous adenocarcinoma (NMAC) treated with NAC had a significantly
   improved 5-year OS rate (76.3% vs. 69.2%, p = .039) and DFS rate (67.2%
   vs. 60.1%, p = .041) compared with patients treated with AC. However,
   there was no significant difference in OS and DFS between the two
   treatment groups among patients with mucinous adenocarcinoma (MAC) and
   signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC).ConclusionIn patients with LACC, the
   prognostic value of NAC varied by histology. NMAC may serve as a
   predictor of improved long-term survival benefit from NAC in these
   patients.

AB BackgroundPharmacies can increase access to vaccines. This study aimed
   to describe trends in the proportion of adolescent and adult
   vaccinations administered in pharmacies in the United States from 2018
   to 2024.Research design and methodsThis was a retrospective
   cross-sectional analysis of medical and pharmacy claims from commercial
   health insurance enrollees. We recorded vaccinations received by
   enrollees >= 9 years of age from 2018 to 2023 (routine vaccines) or 2024
   (seasonal vaccines). We calculated the annual proportion of vaccinations
   occurring in pharmacies and the accumulated percent change in
   vaccination rate during each year from 2020 onward compared to
   2018-2019.ResultsThe proportion of routine vaccinations occurring in
   pharmacies was higher among adults than among adolescents. For most
   routine vaccines, this proportion increased during the study period. The
   lowest proportion was observed for adolescent human papillomavirus
   vaccination in 2018 (0.2%), and the highest for herpes zoster
   vaccination among adults >= 65 years of age in 2023 (88.6%). For all age
   groups, pharmacy-based vaccination was more common for seasonal
   influenza and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines than for all routine vaccines except
   herpes zoster.ConclusionsPharmacy-based vaccination is increasingly
   common in the United States, particularly among adults and for seasonal
   vaccines, and can help increase the overall level of vaccine uptake.

AB Vaccine hesitancy primarily consists of confidence, complacency, and
   convenience, including geographical accessibility. However, few studies
   in developed countries have focused on the association between
   geographical accessibility to vaccination services and vaccination
   status and previous studies have shown conflicting results. This
   cross-sectional study aimed to clarify the association between the
   number of medical facilities within a 15-minute driving distance from
   the place of residence and influenza vaccination status, using a large
   nationwide internet survey in Japan (n = 27,440). Postal codes were used
   to determine participants' place of residence and the number of medical
   facilities within a 15-minute drive was calculated using geographic
   information system data. Participants were classified into quartiles
   based on the number of medical facilities nearby. They reported their
   influenza vaccination status over the past year. Modified Poisson
   regression analysis was conducted with influenza vaccination status as
   the dependent variable and the number of medical facilities nearby as
   the independent variable, adjusted for covariates stratified by age
   (under 65 years: or 65 years and older). Among participants aged 65
   years and older, those with fewer medical facilities within a 15-minute
   drive of their place of residence were significantly less likely to have
   received an influenza vaccination than those with more medical
   facilities nearby (prevalence ratio in Q1 relative to Q4: 0.93, 95%
   confidence interval 0.87-0.99). In contrast, no association was observed
   among participants aged under 65 years. Geographical accessibility to
   vaccination services may influence vaccine hesitancy among older adults
   in Japan, a developed country.

AB In recent years, several clinical trials focused on the potential role
   of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in the adjuvant treatment of
   muscle-invasive urothelial cancer (UC). Heretofore, only the
   anti-programmed death protein 1 (anti-PD1) nivolumab received European
   Medical Agency (EMA) approval for cisplatin-unfit patients. In our work,
   we deeply analyzed the results of the three pivotal studies in view of
   the rapidly evolving therapeutic advanced UC's scenario. Furthermore,
   there are several ongoing research to investigate ICIs and other
   emerging immune agents in this setting; results are awaited.
   Additionally, current efforts have been made to assess the role of these
   agents in earlier disease settings, particularly in high-risk
   non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). In our review, we analyzed
   the potential role of predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers that may
   improve patient selection and treatment efficacy. To conclude, we
   highlighted the upcoming changes that could redefine the standard of
   care for patients with early-stage UC.

AB The production of natural fiber-based composites benefits various
   industries, including sports equipment, wind turbine blades, building
   materials, packaging, and medical devices, by enabling more
   environmentally friendly applications. Using a variety of statistical
   laws, the mechanical properties of newly generated fibers from the
   Dracaena draco fiber (DDF) plant are being examined in order to
   determine how the tests' number (N) affects the tensile behavior of the
   fibers. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quasi-static stress
   performance of DDF fibers with a gauge length of 40 mm. In order to
   ascertain the effect of N on the tensile resistance, rupture
   deformation, and Young's modulus of 200 DDF fibers, the fibers were
   tensile tested in seven groups: 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 200. The
   mechanical properties data were statistically analyzed using Weibull and
   log-normal distributions, as well as their variability was examined and
   estimated via maximum likelihood and least-squares prediction model with
   a 95% confidence level.

AB BackgroundHigh prices and other access barriers have contributed to the
   rise of a market for compounded glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor
   agonists for weight loss in the United States. This market has not been
   systematically studied. We conducted a pilot study to assess the
   prevalence, characteristics, and advertising content of
   direct-to-consumer providers of compounded glucagon-like peptide-1
   products for weight loss in Colorado.MethodsWe conducted a
   cross-sectional study of websites advertising compounded glucagon-like
   peptide-1 products for weight loss in Colorado. Websites were identified
   using Google searches focused on census-defined statistical areas.
   Searches were conducted between March 21 and April 12, 2024. Data
   collected from websites included physical addresses, business type,
   highest reported staff credential, advertised glucagon-like peptide-1
   products, whether businesses referred to Food and Drug Administration
   approval when describing products, and whether businesses referred to
   products as 'generic'.ResultsWe identified 93 business websites
   advertising compounded glucagon-like peptide-1 products for weight loss
   corresponding to 188 physical locations throughout Colorado. Most
   businesses were self-categorized as medical/health spas (33/93) or
   weight loss services (26/93). Advertised products included semaglutide
   (92/93), tirzepatide (40/93), liraglutide (2/93), and retatrutide
   (1/93). Advertised combination products included B vitamins (8/93),
   levocarnitine (1/93), mannitol (1/93), BPC-157 (1/93), and glycine
   (1/93). Seven websites advertised oral formulations. Additionally, 41/93
   websites referred to Food and Drug Administration approval in their
   descriptions of compounded products and 5/93 referred to products as
   'generic'.ConclusionThis study identified several instances of
   unapproved glucagon-like peptide-1 products being compounded and
   advertised in Colorado. Additionally, 1 product was advertised as
   compounded with BPC-157, a substance determined by the Food and Drug
   Administration to be unsafe for compounding. This study also identified
   numerous examples of misleading claims regarding the regulatory status
   of compounded glucagon-like peptide-1 products. Regulatory action is
   needed to ensure the benefits of compounded GLP-1 products outweigh the
   risks.

AB BackgroundThe increase in the consumption of herbal medicines and their
   documented adverse reactions (ARs) necessitate countries to have good
   pharmacovigilance (PV) systems at all levels. PV systems should be
   frequently assessed in a systematic manner with available harmonised
   tools to monitor the implementation of efforts, strengthen the systems
   and identify areas for improvement.ObjectivesThis study aimed to assess
   the performance of pharmacovigilance and its quality systems for
   monitoring herbal medicine safety at the National PV Centre at the
   Tanzania Medicines and Medical Devices Authority (TMDA), manufacturers
   and herbal medicine marketing authorisation holders (MAHs) to identify
   gaps, challenges and opportunities for improvement.MethodsA descriptive
   cross-sectional study was conducted using structured interviews with key
   informants, questionnaires administered by the researchers and document
   analysis. A retrospective study of suspected ARs to herbal medicines
   received via the TMDA was also performed.ResultsPolicies and a legal
   framework for regulatory control and safety monitoring of herbal
   medicines were in place with a well-established and functional PV system
   at the TMDA. However, some gaps and challenges in the safety monitoring
   of herbal medicines, such as underreporting, lack of training, and
   dissemination of PV information, have been identified. A total of 18
   reports containing 40 suspected herbal medicine ARs were received at the
   TMDA. Among the MAHs, only 64% had PV systems, with only 29% having
   mechanisms for the collection of ARs from their products. Only a few
   MAHs (39%) had a qualified person in the PV. The majority of the MAHs
   (64%) had established a quality system for PV; however, the systems were
   inadequate.ConclusionDeliberate efforts need to be made to strengthen
   herbal medicine safety monitoring at the regulatory level. MAHs need to
   develop efficient PV systems and recruit qualified persons to identify
   safety issues related to herbal medicines.

AB Background: Racial discrimination is associated with health disparities
   among Black Americans, a group that has experienced an increase in rates
   of fatal drug overdose. Prior research has found that racial
   discrimination in the medical setting may be a barrier to addiction
   treatment. Nevertheless, it is unknown how experiences of racial
   discrimination might impact engagement with emergency medical services
   for accidental drug overdose. This study will psychometrically assess a
   new measure of hesitancy in seeking emergency medical services for
   accidental drug overdose and examine prior experiences of racial
   discrimination and group-based medical mistrust as potential corollaries
   of this hesitancy. Method: Cross-sectional survey of 200 Black adults
   seeking treatment for substance-use-related medical problems (i.e.
   substance use disorder, overdose, infectious complications of substance
   use, etc.). Participants will complete a survey including
   sociodemographic information, the Discrimination in Medical Settings
   Scale, Everyday Discrimination Scale, Group-Based Medical Mistrust
   Scale, and an original questionnaire measuring perceptions of and prior
   engagement with emergency services for accidental drug overdose.
   Analyses will include exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, and
   non-parametric partial correlations controlling for age, gender, income,
   and education. Conclusions: This article describes a planned
   cross-sectional survey of Black patients seeking treatment for substance
   use related health problems. Currently, there is no validated instrument
   to measure hesitancy in seeking emergency medical services for
   accidental drug overdose or how experiences of racial discrimination
   might relate to such hesitancy. Results of this study may provide
   actionable insight into medical discrimination and the rising death toll
   of accidental drug overdose among Black Americans.

AB ObjectivesThe attitudes and perceptions of healthcare consumers (HCCs)
   are increasingly becoming more relevant in decision-making with
   healthcare providers and incorporated into healthcare decision-making by
   national immunization technical advisory groups and health technology
   assessment agencies. With newer pneumococcal vaccine options available,
   HCCs' attitudes and perceptions play a key role in gauging potential
   acceptance. The objective of this study was to assess HCCs' knowledge,
   attitudes, and perceptions toward pneumococcal vaccines for
   adults.MethodsBetween March and May 2024, eligible U.S. adult HCCs were
   invited to participate in an online survey focusing on experiences and
   attitudes toward vaccines.ResultsAmong 141 participating HCCs, average
   age was 53.1 years. The majority of participants were male (51.1%) and
   64.5% identified as White. Most HCCs received at least one vaccine in
   the past year (81.6%). HCCs most often received vaccines at medical
   offices and pharmacies. HCCs supported lowering the age-based
   pneumococcal vaccine recommendation to all adults 50 years and older and
   were willing to receive a supplemental pneumococcal vaccine dose
   following completion of the recommended series for additional
   protection.ConclusionsThese findings indicate that new adult
   pneumococcal vaccines would be accepted and valued by HCCs if
   recommended by HCPs.

   Guideline Development Group (GDG) identified the risk factors of OHSS
   before and during ovarian stimulation. The relation of different
   pre-treatment measures and different ovarian stimulation protocols with
   OHSS was evaluated. The optimal monitoring during treatment was
   assessed. The current evidence on preventive strategies during and after
   ovarian stimulation and the available adjuvant preventive agents were
   examined. Based on this, the GDG developed evidence-based, graded
   recommendations for clinical practice. The evidence was evaluated within
   context, considering the effectiveness, cost and practical problems of
   assisted reproductive technology for patients and healthcare providers.
   Early identification and application of preventive measures identified
   in this guideline may reduce the incidence of OHSS or reduce its
   severity. Suggestions for future research on OHSS prevention are

AB Background: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a significant
   worldwide health challenge, with far-reaching implications for both
   patients and healthcare systems. This study aimed to identify the
   incidence of CKD at stages 3-5, analyzed the impact of statin and other
   antihyperglycemic interventions, on the CKD progression in individuals
   with T2DM. Methods: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study
   based on data derived from electronic medical records (EMR) of UAE
   populations with diabetes mellitus, registered at outpatient clinics at
   Tawam Hospital in Al Ain, UAE, between January 2011 and December 2021.
   T2DM patients aged >= 18 years who had serum HbA1c level >= 6.5% and
   using one of the statin therapies were inclusion criteria. Patients with
   T1DM, who had undergone permanent renal replacement therapy, with under
   1 year of follow-up and missing or incomplete data were excluded from
   the study. The collected data encompassed socio-demographics, detailed
   medical history, anthropometric measurements, laboratory analyses,
   clinical parameters, disease characteristics, and medications. Results:
   Our study included a cohort of 1,003 individuals. We observed 388
   subjects developed CKD stages 3-5 across an average monitoring duration
   of 11.7 years. This resulted in a cumulative incidence of 38.7%,
   translating to an incidence rate of 38 cases per 1000 person-years.
   There was a statistically significant difference in the cumulative
   incidence of CKD stages 3 +/- 5 according to statin therapy (P = 0.047).
   High intensity statin users are more likely to develop a CKD stage 3-5
   compared to low/moderate intensity users and to no statin users
   respectively (44.3% vs 37.9%), (44.3% vs 30.9%). Conversely, the use of
   Biguanides was associated with a decreased probability of CKD
   progression (37.9% vs. 52.8%; P = 0.001), whereas Insulin users
   demonstrated a heightened risk (54.2% vs. 34.1%; P < 0.001). Conclusion:
   The findings emphasise the pivotal role of personalised treatment
   strategies, particularly concerning statin therapy and other
   medications, in populations at high risk.

AB Background: The COVID-19 pandemic raised concerns about the effects of
   vaccination on menstrual cycles. This study investigated the association
   between COVID-19 vaccination and menstrual irregularities among women
   aged 18-41 in Saudi Arabia.Methods: A national cross-sectional survey
   conducted in August 2022 included 397 participants meeting specific
   criteria. Data on vaccination history, menstrual patterns, and
   psychological well-being were collected via a structured online
   questionnaire.Results: Of the participants, 61.5% reported menstrual
   changes after at least two COVID-19 vaccine doses, and 32.7% experienced
   changes after the third dose. Common changes included altered cycle
   intervals (63.5%), duration (52%), and blood volume (48.8%).
   Psychological status improved post-lockdown and was significantly
   associated with menstrual changes (p = 0.013). Most participants
   received the Pfizer vaccine, but no significant link was found between
   vaccine type and irregularities. Despite these changes, only 10.7%
   sought medical care, while 42.1% reported a return to normalcy without
   intervention.Conclusions: A majority of participants associated
   menstrual changes with COVID-19 vaccination, consistent with prior
   studies. These findings highlight the need for further research on
   vaccine-related effects to support women's health.

AB BackgroundMalnutrition is prevalent in patients with inflammatory bowel
   disease (IBD); however, its ability to predict the disease activity in
   IBD remains unexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the
   association between malnutrition and disease activity in IBD.MethodsIn
   this retrospective study, we enrolled 1006 patients diagnosed with IBD
   from the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from
   2011 to 2022. Malnutrition was assessed based on the prognostic
   nutritional index (PNI), geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), and
   controlling nutritional status (CONUT) scores. Logistic regression
   analyses were performed to identify predictors for disease activity.
   Restricted cubic spline analysis was performed to evaluate the possible
   nonlinear relations, and subgroup analysis was performed to explore
   potential interactions. Additionally, prediction performances were
   compared through receiver operating characteristic curves, net
   reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination
   improvement.ResultsThe prevalence of malnutrition calculated by the PNI,
   GNRI, and CONUT scores in IBD was 16.9%, 72.1%, and 75.6%, respectively
   and significant correlations were observed among them. Multivariate
   logistic regression analysis showed that PNI, GNRI, and CONUT were
   independent risk factors for disease activity, and no significant
   nonlinear relationship was observed between disease activity and all
   three indexes. No statistically significant interactive effect was found
   in nearly all the subgroups. GNRI showed the highest predictive value
   compared with PNI and CONUT. Additionally, combining any of the three
   indexes improved the ability of C-reactive protein to predict IBD
   activity.ConclusionsAll three nutritional indexes evaluated malnutrition
   to be an independent risk factor for IBD activity.

AB Healthcare workers have a unique opportunity to recognize and provide
   support to HT/DV victims. The objective of this study is to determine if
   students are more prepared to identify and work with these patient
   populations after being trained on the topic by the International Rescue
   Committee (IRC). The IRC came to the University of Arizona College of
   Medicine- Phoenix (UACOMP) to do an optional one hour training of HT/DV
   in healthcare for current first and second year medical students. After
   IRB approval from the UACOMP Research Office for Medical Education
   (ROME), pre and post surveys were given to a total of 26 students who
   attended the training. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests adjusted for multiple
   comparisons were used to evaluate differences between pre- and
   post-training scores. Students had statistically significant improvement
   in self-reported comfort level scores for recommending resources,
   providing care, and calling the national hotline for individuals who
   have experienced human trafficking and domestic violence. The marked
   improvement in students' comfort providing resources and care to HT/DV
   victims after just a 1 h training from the IRC on these topics
   demonstrates the impact that early exposure to HT/DV education can have
   in vulnerable patient populations.

AB In northern Canada, medical travel - the movement of patients to a
   larger centre to access healthcare services outside their home community
   - is a dominant feature of the healthcare system. This qualitative study
   explored the medical travel experiences of Gwich'in living above the
   Arctic Circle in the Gwich'in Settlement Area in Northwest Territories
   (NT). Data collection in 2020 comprised storytelling sessions with 10
   Gwich'in medical travellers (6 female, 4 male). Using inductive and
   deductive methods with continual critical reflexivity, and guided by
   Gwich'in values, concerns about access to healthcare were found to be at
   the heart of each story. A broad conceptualisation of access was applied
   to understand and interpret the results according to six dimensions:
   accessibility, availability, affordability, adequacy, acceptability, and
   awareness. Situated within a context of colonialism, structural
   inequities and other factors relevant across the Circumpolar North, the
   results suggest that the NT medical travel policy framework provides
   only partial access to care. This article illustrates a need for
   healthcare and other government systems to think about policy and
   programmes in a more wholistic, equitable and relationship-centred way,
   which would help not only to bridge distances across geography, but also
   between peoples.

AB BackgroundNew digital learning environments have transformed medical
   education and training, allowing students and teachers to engage in
   synchronous, real-time interactions and asynchronous learning activities
   online. Despite extensive research on the role of digital technologies
   in education, understanding the interplay between digital technology,
   work, and learning, especially in complex fields like healthcare,
   remains a challenge.ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to examine
   resident physicians' perceptions and experiences of using a digital
   learning environment as part of their specialist medical training. The
   paper focuses on digital learning through video conferencing (virtual
   lectures and seminars) and related learning technologies. It aims to
   understand how resident physicians perceive pedagogical opportunities
   and challenges in digital learning environments during their medical
   training and what strategies they use to address these.Materials and
   MethodsThe methodological approach is qualitative, aiming to capture and
   understand participants' experiences and views of digital learning. The
   empirical data gathered from open-ended responses to four course
   evaluation surveys and semi-structured interviews with nine physicians
   from a cohort of participants enrolled in two or more digital courses
   were analyzed through thematic analysis. The analysis revealed three
   main themes related to digital transformation of learning:
   sociotechnical, educational and administrative.ResultsThe results
   suggest that (i) sociotechnical aspects and understanding of the context
   in which the learning takes place contribute to enhancing digital
   learning for resident physicians; (ii) insights into participants'
   perceptions of digital learning emphasize that interactive communication
   and group discussions are significant for their learning, and (iii)
   administrative aspects related to course design, lecture management, and
   instructional support are more important in digital learning
   environments compared to traditional teaching and
   learning.ConclusionFindings from this study confirm and extend prior
   studies on digital learning in healthcare, contributing to a better
   understanding of how digital learning environments, especially virtual
   lectures and seminars, can be developed and integrated into residency
   programs and health professions education to increase their usefulness.

AB BackgroundMuch remains to be learned about patients with heart failure
   with improved ejection fraction (HFimpEF).ObjectiveThis study sheds
   light on the characteristics and clinical outcomes of HFimpEF patients,
   including the consequences of halting guideline-directed medical therapy
   (GDMT).MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted on patients
   diagnosed with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who
   underwent a second echocardiogram at least 6 months apart between
   January 2009 and February 2023. The primary outcomes were major adverse
   cardiovascular events (MACEs), including all-cause mortality and heart
   failure hospitalization. The second outcome was recurrent
   HFrEF.ResultsOf 4,560 HFrEF patients were included, 3,289 (72.1%)
   achieved HFimpEF within a median follow-up period of 3.4 years (IQR: 1.8
   - 5.9 years). Among these HFimpEF patients, recurrent HFrEF was observed
   in 941 (28.6%) patients during a median follow-up period of 2.3 years
   (IQR: 0.8-4.6 years). The proportion of patients who halted GDMT was
   70.4%, 53.2%, 59.8% and 63.8% for MRA, beta-blockers, ACEI/ARB/ARNI and
   SGLT-2 inhibitors. Multivariable Cox analysis revealed ischemic heart
   disease, chronic kidney disease, coronary heart disease, lower left
   ventricular ejection fraction, larger left ventricular diastolic
   dimension and non-use GDMT are associated with recurrent HFrEF.
   Individuals without GDMT use exhibited lower chances of persistently
   recovering ejection fraction and high risks of MACEs compared to those
   who continue use.ConclusionsHFimpEF is a common condition across all
   clinical follow-ups. Prevalent discontinuation of GDMT medications may
   contribute significantly to recurrent HFrEF, placing patients at a
   higher risk for poor prognosis.

AB BackgroundPoly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, such as Olaparib
   (Lynparza (R)), are pivotal in treating certain cancers, particularly
   those linked to BReast CAncer gene (BRCA) mutations. Despite its
   established efficacy, Olaparib use is associated with various adverse
   events (AEs), notably haematologic toxicities, such as anaemia. This
   retrospective chart review study aimed to examine haematologic outcomes
   and associated factors in patients treated with Olaparib at a tertiary
   hospital in the UAE.MethodsWe reviewed the medical charts of patients
   prescribed Olaparib and focused on haematologic indices at a baseline of
   1-month, 3-month and 6-month follow-up periods. Data were analysed to
   determine the AEs frequency, transfusions need and potential associated
   patients' clinical characteristics.ResultsThis study included all
   patients who received Olaparib (n = 66). Most patients were females (n =
   61; 92.4%) and the vast majority were non-smokers (97%) and free of
   hepatic disease. Themean age of the patients was 57.03-year-old (SD) =
   12.06 years), and body mass index (BMI) was 28.16 (SD = 6.40) kg/m2. A
   high rate of anaemia (70.8%) was detected among the patients during
   their Olaparib therapy. Approximately, one-third of the patients
   developed neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Transfusion was needed in
   almost half of the patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and
   neutropenia were significantly correlated with moderate-severe anaemia
   (OR = 0.097, 95% CI: 0.011-0.88, p value = .038) and (OR = 9.04, 95% CI:
   1.024-79.78, p value = .048), respectively.ConclusionsOur findings
   highlight the side effects of Olaparib therapy in terms of haematology
   which could be avoided. Further studies are needed to better understand
   the therapeutic management of Olaparib and the mitigation of
   haematologic complications.

AB BackgroundA smoking partner is a major risk factor for passive smoking
   and continued maternal smoking.ObjectiveTo assess the smoking habits,
   knowledge, and information received to stop smoking of smoking partners
   during their spouse's pregnancy.MethodThis was a cross-sectional study
   of partners who smoked at the start of pregnancy and whose spouses had
   just given birth. Recruitment was carried out in maternity hospitals in
   the Auvergne-Rh & ocirc;ne-Alpes region from June 2021 to December 2021.
   Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire.ResultsA
   total of 105 men using tobacco were recruited, average age 34 years (+/-
   6.4). Of these, 46 (44%) had modified their consumption during
   pregnancy: 11 (10.5%) had stopped smoking until maternity hospital
   entry, 24 (23%) had cut down and 11 (10.5%) had relapsed after initial
   total cessation. A multivariate analysis revealed a statistically
   significant relationship between men's change in smoking behaviour
   during pregnancy and a first pregnancy, an overweight participant, not
   living in a rural area, and information provided by the General
   Practitioner (GP). GPs are the first point of contact for participants
   looking for help to quit smoking. Among men who have not changed their
   smoking habits, 46% have not received any information from health
   professionals.ConclusionsIntervention and medical information provided
   by GPs to smoking partners may be associated with changes in smoking
   habits during pregnancy. Additional prospective, comparative studies are
   needed to support a robust conclusion.

AB IntroductionInfertility is a major public health issue, with male
   factors alone contributing to 20-30% of cases. Non-obstructive
   azoospermia (NOA) is the most severe form, and although techniques like
   microdissection testicular sperm extraction (mTESE) offer hope, it
   remains challenging due to its uncertain causes. This study investigates
   the correlation between testicular histopathology and clinical
   parameters to enhance sperm retrieval (SR) prediction.Materials and
   methodsWe reviewed 57 azoospermic men from Hanoi Medical University
   Hospital, recruited between January 2021 and September 2023. Inclusion
   criteria were confirmed azoospermia and exclusion of known NOA causes.
   All underwent mTESE with testicular biopsies classified into four
   histopathological patterns.ResultsThe patients' mean age was 31.75 +/-
   5.19 years. SR was successful in 19.3% (11/57). Higher
   follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels were noted in SR-positive men
   (p = 0.02). Sertoli cell-only syndrome (SCOS) was the most common
   pattern. While we found a significant difference in SR rate between
   testicular histopathology, multivariate analysis showed no strong
   association. However, FSH levels were predictive of histopathology
   patterns.ConclusionsIdiopathic NOA (iNOA) represents over 60% of
   azoospermia cases. mTESE remains the gold standard, and FSH levels may
   help predict testicular histopathology patterns and improving patients
   prognosis of SR outcomes.

AB ObjectiveRuptured peripheral cerebral aneurysm (PPCA) associated with
   moyamoya disease (MMD) is rarely reported, and its optimal treatment
   remains controversial. This study aims to present the clinical
   characteristics, treatment strategies, and outcome predictors of this
   rare clinical entity.MethodsA retrospective review of patients with
   hemorrhagic MMD from January 2013 to December 2020 was performed. All
   medical records were independently compiled and
   reviewed.ResultsTwenty-three patients were identified, 56.5% of whom
   were female. The mean age was 45.9 years with a peak age of onset of
   51-60 years. Most patients (65.2%) developed intraventricular hemorrhage
   with or without intracerebral hemorrhage. These aneurysms were
   frequently located on the anterior (26.1%) and posterior (43.5%)
   choroidal arteries. Sixteen (69.6%) aneurysms were embolized and the
   remaining 7 (30.4%) were managed conservatively due to approach
   inaccessibility. Good outcomes were achieved in 82.6% of all cases, with
   81.3% for embolization and 85.7% for observation. Complete occlusion was
   observed in all 16 aneurysms embolized. Of the conservatively treated
   aneurysms, 1 (14.3%) re-ruptured, 1 (14.3%) decreased in size, 2 (28.6%)
   disappeared, and 3 (42.8%) remained stable in size. Aneurysm rebleeding
   was associated with an unfavorable outcome (P = 0.026).ConclusionsPPCA
   should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic MMD.
   Aneurysm rebleeding appears to be a potential predictor of poor outcome
   and therefore aggressive intervention should be advocated. Endovascular
   embolization may be safe and feasible, and conservative observation
   should be carefully chosen given the high risk of aneurysm re-rupture.

AB ObjectiveTo investigate the optic disc changes (ODC) in Chinese patients
   with NLRP3-associated autoinflammatory disease
   (NLRP3-AID).MethodsPatients who were diagnosed with NLRP3-AID at the
   Department of Rheumatology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital
   between April 2015 and December 2022 were retrospectively reviewed and
   analyzed.ResultsA total of 20 patients were enrolled in this
   retrospective study. All 20 patients had a moderate MWS NLRP3-AID
   phenotype. Thirteen patients (65%) had ocular involvements. The interval
   between symptoms onset and diagnosis was significantly longer in
   patients with ocular involvement than in patients without (p = 0.044).
   The incidence of hearing loss was significantly higher in patients with
   ocular involvement (p = 0.017), while the incidence of abdominal pain
   was significantly lower when compared to patients without ocular
   involvement (p = 0.007). Optic disc swelling (ODS) (50%) was the most
   common ODC. All of the four T348M mutation carriers within our cohort
   exhibited ODS with visual-field defects. There was a significant
   difference between patients with/without ODS regarding the number of
   patients carrying T348M mutation (p = 0.014). The occurrence of hearing
   loss and CNS involvement was significantly higher in the group with ODS
   compared to the group without (p = 0.0014, p = 0.0198). Of the eight
   patients who underwent lumbar puncture, five presented with intracranial
   hypertension (IH). ODS was observed in all patients with IH. The serum
   inflammatory markers were significantly higher in patients with ODS than
   in those without. Two patients receiving regular subcutaneous IL-1
   inhibitor treatment showed improvements in ODC.ConclusionsODC is common
   among Chinese patients with NLRP3-AID, with ODS being the most common
   manifestation. Hearing loss and CNS involvement often accompany the
   occurrence of ODS. The serum inflammatory markers are associated with
   ODS. The T348M mutation is more likely to lead to ODC with visual-field
   defects.

   suicidal behaviors among genders.AimsTo estimate the association between
   physicians' sociodemographics and their rating of suicide risk and the
   need for hospitalization in men and women.MethodIn an anonymous online
   survey, physicians rated the suicide risk and the need for
   hospitalization of two clinical vignettes (one male and one female
   patient) and answered sociodemographic questions. Generalized estimating
   equations were used to estimate the associations between the vignettes'
   gender and physician's characteristics with the ratings of suicide risk
   and hospitalization needs.ResultsOf the 473 physicians who answered the
   survey, 407 were eligible for the study. Independently of other
   socio-demographics, (i) male physicians rated suicide risk and
   hospitalization need lower than their female counterparts, (ii) scores
   for female and male patients didn't differ, and (iii) physicians rated
   higher hospitalization need for same-gender patients.LimitationsWe used
   a binary categorization for gender, which does not account for
   non-binary and other gender identities.ConclusionPhysician gender
   impacts evaluations of suicide risk and the need for hospitalization.
   Future studies should explore how physician gender affects clinical
   practice and inform gender-sensitive medical training.

AB Mistreatment during institutional childbirth is multifactorial and can
   have a detrimental effect on women's health and future care-seeking
   behaviour. Understanding its determinants is essential for improving
   respectful maternity care. This study aimed to explore women's
   experiences of mistreatment during childbirth in Nepal. Sixteen in-depth
   interviews were conducted with women who had recently given birth in a
   tertiary health facility (between 5 and 16 weeks postpartum).
   Participants were selected using purposive sampling to ensure a
   heterogenous sample. Data were analysed using Nvivo12, following Braun
   and Clarke's thematic analysis approach. Four themes were identified:
   (1) mistreatment and undignified care, (2) health system constraints,
   (3) adverse hospital culture, (4) power and territorial display.
   Mistreatment and undignified care included abuse, threats, neglect,
   inadequate communication, painful medical procedures and lack of
   autonomy. Health system constraints included inadequate resources and
   overcrowding. Adverse hospital culture was characterised by work stress
   among health professionals, a rigid hierarchical structure and the
   normalisation of mistreatment practices. Power and territoriality were
   evident in an atmosphere of fear for women with restricted companionship
   during birth. Favorable institutional strategies and tailored
   interventions are needed to eliminate solitary births and to provide
   women-centered respectful care by motivated and competent health
   professionals.

AB Background: Research is needed to understand the impact of mental health
   disorders (MHD) on healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs
   among people with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH). Objectives:
   Examine the HCRU and cost burden among treatment-naive PWH with and
   without MHD initiating single tablet antiretroviral regimens (STRs) and
   multi-tablet regimens (MTRs). Methods: A retrospective database analysis
   of the US Medicaid population from Anlitiks' All Payor Claims database
   between 1 January 2016 and 30 June 2023 was conducted. Treatment-naive
   MTR-initiators vs STR-initiators (the index was the first prescription
   fill claim date) with >= 12-months pre- and post-index continuous
   enrollment and no pre-index HIV-2 diagnosis among PWH/MHD and PWH/no-MHD
   during 1 January 2017-30 June 2022 were selected. Demographics, clinical
   characteristics, HCRU and costs between MTR-initiators vs STR-initiators
   among PWH/MHD and PWH/no-MHD were described using Chi-square tests and
   Wilcoxon rank-sum or t-tests for categorical and continuous variables,
   as appropriate. HCRU and costs were examined using multivariable
   logistic and gamma-log link regression models, controlling for potential
   confounders. Results: MTR-initiators (PWH/MHD: n = 7,874, PWH/no-MHD: n
   = 3,612) vs. STR-initiators (PWH/MHD: 46,024, PWH/no-MHD: 23,452) were
   significantly younger (PWH/MHD: 43.6 vs. 47.2 years; PWH/no-MHD: 39.2
   vs. 43.3 years) and more likely to be female (PWH/MHD: 46.4% vs. 35.7%;
   PWH/no-MHD: 42.3% vs 29.7%) in both groups (all p-values < 0.05).
   MTR-initiators vs. STR-initiators had significantly higher rates of
   inpatient (IP) hospitalizations (PWH/MHD: 28.9% vs. 27.1%;
   PWH/no-MHD:13.9% vs. 11.9%) and emergency department (ED) visits
   (PWH/MHD: 53.3% vs. 49.2%; PWH/no-MHD: 35.2% vs. 31.8%) among both those
   with and without MHD (all p-values < 0.05). MTR-initiators vs.
   STR-initiators also had significantly higher adjusted all-cause medical
   costs (PWH/MHD: $60,228 vs $40,634; PWH/no-MHD: $33,623 vs. $17,996)
   (all p-values < 0.05). Conclusions: Among PWH/MHD and PWH/no-MHD,
   MTR-initiators experienced significantly higher HCRU, and 1.5 times
   greater costs compared to STR-initiators. In both MTR and STR-initiator
   groups, the PWH/MHD cohort consistently demonstrated a greater HCRU and
   cost burden than the PWH/no-MHD.

AB Task shifting can improve access, availability, efficiency, and quality
   of health services in under resourced settings. Task shifting can occur
   formally or informally within health professions, between health
   professions, between support staff and health professions, or between
   lay community members and health professionals. There are currently
   thousands of Indigenous peoples in Canada's high Arctic, living in
   remote communities, north of the 60th parallel with limited access to
   basic medical services. In Nunavut, 25 remote fly-in communities exist
   in some of the most sparsely populated and harshest conditions on earth.
   Diminished access to or absence of basic health services such as
   diagnostic imaging and staff resources in remote communities can have a
   detrimental effect on patient care, and health outcomes. The existence
   of a community based diagnostic x-ray training program using a task
   shifting model addresses a gap in quality and access to services and
   subsequent treatment for community residents in this region.

AB Due to the need to hospitalize a large number of patients during the
   COVID-19 pandemic, the psychological conditions of hospitalized patients
   were often overlooked. This study focuses on the qualitative analysis of
   the subjective experiences of patients with a severe COVID-19 disease in
   Slovakia during hospitalization. A total of 27 Slovak participants (11
   men and 16 women, mean age 57.10 years) who were hospitalized with
   severe COVID-19 disease were interviewed about their subjective
   experiences during hospitalization. The data was analysed using thematic
   analysis. The main themes included negative emotions such as distress,
   discomfort with the illness, discomfort with the medical environment and
   helplessness. The main sources of distress were the sense of isolation,
   witnessing the death of another patient, own death concerns, and
   concerns for others. Sources and strategies used by patients to improve
   their mental state included interpersonal resources such as contact with
   relatives and friends, instrumental support from them, mutual help among
   patients and professional psychological support. Interpersonal resources
   included optimism, hope, religion and spirituality, recollection of
   significant others, and reconciliation with the possibility of death.
   The results have implications for medical staff as they help them to
   understand the psychological state of COVID-19 patients during
   hospitalization and can inform psychological interventions to improve
   hospital care for these patients.

AB BackgroundLuteal phase support (LPS) with progesterone is a generally
   accepted practice after controlled ovarian stimulation, although the
   best protocols for LPS have been debated. We aimed to compare the
   efficacy of vaginal micronised progesterone tablets and 8% vaginal
   progesterone gel for LPS using real-world data.MethodsThis retrospective
   study included 459 in vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm
   injection cycles performed at a university hospital from 2005 to 2019.
   All cycles were followed by fresh day 3 embryo transfer (ET). Either
   progesterone tablets or gel was used for LPS. To control the conditional
   probability of progesterone tablets or gel use, doubly robust inverse
   probability weighting composed of inverse-probability-of-treatment
   weighting (IPTW) and regression adjustment (RA). IPTW was performed
   based on the covariate balancing propensity score
   (CBPS).ResultsProgesterone tablets were administered in 65 cycles, and
   progesterone gel was administered in 394 cycles. Women who used
   progesterone tablets were more likely to be older (36 vs. 34 years),
   have primary infertility (78.5% vs. 61.4%), use gonadotropin-releasing
   hormone antagonist (60.0% vs. 43.2%), and have fewer retrieved oocytes
   (seven vs. nine) and transferred embryos (two vs. three) than
   participants who used progesterone gel. After IPTW-CBPS and RA analysis
   for the above covariates, the adjusted odds for clinical pregnancy in
   women who used progesterone tablets were 1.10 times compared with women
   who used progesterone gel; however, the 95% confidence interval did not
   reach statistical significance (0.96-1.26).ConclusionsClinical pregnancy
   was comparable between vaginal micronised progesterone tablets and
   vaginal progesterone gel for LPS in fresh day 3 ET cycles.

AB Background: Hyperkalemia is a medical condition characterized by excess
   potassium in the blood. Overindulgence in foods high in potassium can
   also result in hyperkalemia, particularly in individuals with severe
   kidney disease.. Aim of the study: In this study, hyperkalemia was
   assessed in Wistar albino rats administered with M. acuminata. Material
   and Methods: Thirty-six rats underwent various treatments over three
   months after being randomly divided into groups of six. Standard
   medications administered included Lisinopril and keyaxalate. The
   proximate and mineral content of raw banana (RB) and normal rat pellets
   (NRP) were compared and evaluated with that of cooked banana (CB). The
   rats' serum and urine calcium and potassium levels were measured using
   established protocols. Results: In comparison to RB, CB was found to
   have significantly higher levels of nutrients (proteins and fats) and
   minerals (calcium, sodium, and potassium). Administration of CB markedly
   significantly increased serum potassium levels however, keyaxalate
   decreased urine potassium levels; the treatment of kayexalate plus
   lisinopril markedly decreased urine Ca concentration (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: Cooked banana has a higher mineral and nutritional content
   than raw banana. Continuous and daily consumption of cooked bananas led
   to hyperkalemia in Wistar rats as evidenced by elevated serum potassium
   levels.

AB ObjectivesIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), a condition
   exclusive to pregnancy, necessitates prompt identification and
   intervention to improve the perinatal outcomes. This study aims to
   develop suitable machine-learning models for predicting ICP based on
   clinical and laboratory indicators.MethodsThis study retrospectively
   analyzed data from 1092 pregnant women, with 537 diagnosed with ICP and
   555 healthy cases as a control. Two study schemes were devised. For
   scheme 1, 62 indicators from the first period of gestation were utilized
   to establish predictive models. For scheme 2, 62 indicators from at
   least two periods of gestation were utilized to establish predictive
   models. Under each scheme, three different machine-learning models were
   developed based on the Arya Privacy Computing Platform, encompassing
   Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and Xgboost for
   Scheme 1, and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory
   Network (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for Scheme 2. The
   predictive efficacy of each model on ICP was evaluated and
   compared.ResultsUnder Scheme 1, the cohort comprised 1092 pregnant women
   (537 with ICP, 555 healthy). The SVM model exhibited a sensitivity,
   specificity, and accuracy of 85.5%, 47.50%, and 67.90%, respectively,
   while DNN showed 65.70%, 92.70%, and 79.40%, respectively, and Xgboost
   achieved 65.60%, 81.90%, and 73.40%, respectively. In Scheme 2, 899
   pregnant women were analyzed (466 with ICP, 433 healthy). RNN
   demonstrated a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 97.60%, 82.10%,
   and 90.50%, respectively; LSTM presented 90.70%, 81.70%, and 86.60%,
   respectively; and GRU achieved 89.90%, 83.80%, and 89.40%,
   respectively.ConclusionDNN and RNN are the two most suitable models to
   predict ICP in a convenient and available way. It provides flexible
   choice for medical staff and helps them optimize the therapeutic
   strategies to meet different clinical setting and improve the clinical
   prognosis of ICP.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with severe aortic stenosis present frequently
   (50%) with concomitant obstructive coronary artery disease. Current
   guidelines recommend combined surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR)
   and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) as the preferred treatment.
   Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and fractional flow
   reserve (FFR)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) represent
   a valid treatment alternative. We aimed to test the non-inferiority of
   FFR-guided PCI plus TAVI versus SAVR plus CABG in patients with severe
   aortic stenosis and complex coronary artery disease.
   METHODS: This international, multicentre, prospective, open-label,
   non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial was conducted at 18
   tertiary medical centres across Europe. Patients (aged ≥70 years) with
   severe aortic stenosis and complex coronary artery disease, deemed
   feasible for percutaneous or surgical treatment according to the on-site
   Heart Team, were randomly assigned (1:1) to FFR-guided PCI plus TAVI or
   SAVR plus CABG according to a computer-generated sequence with random
   permuted blocks sizes stratified by site. The primary endpoint was a
   composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, disabling
   stroke, clinically driven target-vessel revascularisation, valve
   reintervention, and life-threatening or disabling bleeding at 1 year
   post-treatment. The trial was powered for non-inferiority (with a margin
   of 15%) and if met, for superiority. The primary and safety analyses
   were done per an intention-to-treat principle. This trial is registered
   with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03424941) and is closed.
   FINDINGS: Between May 31, 2018, and June 30, 2023, 172 patients were
   enrolled, of whom 91 were assigned to the FFR-guided PCI plus TAVI group
   and 81 to the SAVR plus CABG group. The mean age of patients was 76·5
   years (SD 3·9). 118 (69%) of 172 patients were male and 54 (31%)
   patients were female. FFR-guided PCI plus TAVI resulted in favourable
   outcomes for the primary endpoint (four [4%] of 91 patients) versus SAVR
   plus CABG (17 [23%] of 77 patients; risk difference -18·5 [90% CI -27·8
   to -9·7]), which was below the 15% prespecified non-inferiority margin
   (pnon-inferiority<0·001). FFR-guided PCI plus TAVI was superior to SAVR
   plus CABG (hazard ratio 0·17 [95% CI 0·06-0·51]; psuperiority<0·001),
   which was driven mainly by all-cause mortality (none [0%] of 91 patients
   vs seven (10%) of 77 patients; p=0·0025) and life-threatening bleeding
   (two [2%] vs nine [12%]; p=0·010).
   INTERPRETATION: The TCW trial is the first trial to compare percutaneous
   treatment versus surgical treatment in patients with severe aortic
   stenosis and complex coronary artery disease, showing favourable primary
   endpoint and mortality outcomes with percutaneous treatment.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
DI 10.3174/ajnr.A8446
EA DEC 2025

PY 2025
AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The total calcification score (TCS) is a visual
   rating scale to measure primary familial brain calcification
   (PFBC)?related calcification severity on CT. We investigated the inter-
   and intrarater agreement of a modified TCS. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
   Patients aged ?18?years with PFBC or Fahr syndrome who visited the
   outpatient clinic of a Dutch academic hospital were included. The TCS
   was modified, for example, by adding hippocampal calcification, and
   ranged from 0 to 95 points. Fifteen raters evaluated all CTs, of whom 3
   evaluated the CTs twice. Their entrustable professional activity (EPA)
   level ranged from II (medical student) to V (neuroradiologist).
   Agreement was assessed by using the intraclass correlation coefficient
   (ICC) for the total score. Kendall?s W and weighted Cohen ? were used to
   determine the inter- and intrarater agreement for individual locations,
   respectively. RESULTS: Forty patients were included (mean age 60?years,
   53% women). The median modified TCS was 34 (range 4?76). For all EPA
   levels, the interrater agreement of the modified TCS was excellent
   (ICC?= 0.97 [95% CI 0.95?0.98]). The Kendall W values were good to
   excellent for commonly affected locations, but poor to moderate for less
   commonly affected locations for raters with lower levels of expertise.
   The intrarater agreement of the modified TCS was excellent. The Cohen ?
   of most locations were substantial to almost perfect. CONCLUSIONS: The
   modified TCS can be used with excellent reproducibility of the overall
   amount of brain calcifications and with limited training, although for
   some individual calcification locations more expertise is needed.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the demographic
   and clinical characteristics of rosacea within the North Jordan
   population, focusing on Fitzpatrick skin types III and IV. The intent is
   to address gaps in dermatological research concerning ethnic and racial
   variations in rosacea's presentation and impact.
   METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis at the dermatology
   department of King Abdullah University Hospital, North Jordan, reviewing
   medical records of patients diagnosed with rosacea from January 2013 to
   December 2023. Data collection focused on demographics, rosacea subtypes
   and environmental factors exacerbating the condition. Statistical
   analysis utilized Jamovi and GraphPad Prism software.
   RESULTS: The study included 610 patients, revealing a rosacea prevalence
   of 1.5% within the hospital's catchment area. Most patients were female
   (84.4%), with a median age of 44. The majority had Fitzpatrick skin
   types III and IV. The erythematotelangiectatic subtype was most common
   (73.6%), followed by papulopustular (23.4%) and phymatous (3%).
   Environmental triggers like sun exposure and temperature changes were
   nearly universally reported as exacerbating factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Rosacea shows significant gender disparities and is
   influenced by environmental factors. The study underscores the need for
   targeted research and treatment strategies that consider ethnic and
   racial variations, along with gender-specific presentations of the
   disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively investigate the predictive value of
   thyroid hormone sensitivity parameters for cervical lymph node
   metastasis in patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer
   (DTC) undergoing total thyroidectomy and neck lymph node dissection.
   METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted involving patients
   diagnosed with DTC and evaluated for cervical lymph node metastasis.
   Relevant demographic, tumour, lymph node and thyroid hormone sensitivity
   parameter data were extracted from medical records and laboratory
   reports. Thyroid hormone sensitivity parameters including thyroxine
   (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),
   thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAbs), thyroid peroxidase
   antibody, thyroid hormone receptor alpha and TSH receptor antibody were
   assessed. Statistical analyses including descriptive statistics,
   comparative analysis, Pearson's correlation analysis, logistic
   regression analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis
   and construction of a multivariable prediction model based on machine
   learning using the xgbTree method were employed to evaluate the
   associations and predictive value of thyroid hormone sensitivity
   parameters for cervical lymph node metastasis.
   RESULTS: The study revealed significant associations between several
   thyroid hormone sensitivity parameters and cervical lymph node
   metastasis in patients with DTC. Specifically, higher levels of T4, T3,
   Tg, TgAbs and TSH receptor antibody were associated with lymph node
   metastasis. Pearson's correlation analysis, logistic regression analysis
   and ROC analysis further underscored the predictive performance of these
   parameters, with strong overall discriminative abilities. The machine
   learning-based prediction model demonstrated promising performance with
   a high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.979.
   CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide compelling evidence for the predictive
   value of thyroid hormone sensitivity parameters, particularly T3, T4,
   Tg, TgAbs and TSH receptor antibody, in identifying and evaluating the
   likelihood of cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with DTC. These
   parameters hold potential implications for risk stratification, clinical
   decision-making and personalized management strategies, contributing to
   improved outcomes for patients at risk of lymph node metastasis.

AB PURPOSE: This study quantified the impact of clinical clerkships on
   medical students' disciplinary knowledge using the Comprehensive
   Clinical Science Examination (CCSE) as a formative assessment tool.
   METHODS: This study involved 155 third-year medical students in the
   College of Human Medicine at Michigan State University who matriculated
   in 2016. Disciplinary scores on their individual Comprehensive Clinical
   Science Examination reports were extracted by digitizing the bar charts
   using image processing techniques. Segmented regression analysis was
   used to quantify the differences in disciplinary knowledge before,
   during, and after clerkships in five disciplines: surgery, internal
   medicine, psychiatry, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology
   (ob/gyn).
   RESULTS: A comparison of the regression intercepts before and during
   their clerkships revealed that, on average, the participants improved
   the most in ob/gyn (beta=11.193, p<.0001), followed by psychiatry
   (beta=10.005, p<.001), pediatrics (beta=6.238, p<.0001), internal
   medicine (beta=1.638, p=.30), and improved the least in surgery
   (beta=-2.332, p=.10). The regression intercepts of knowledge during
   their clerkships and after them, on the other hand, suggested that
   students' average scores improved the most in psychiatry (beta=7.649,
   p=.008), followed by ob/gyn (beta=4.175, p=.06), surgery (beta=4.106,
   p=.007), and pediatrics (beta=1.732, p=.32).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight how clerkships influence the
   acquisition of disciplinary knowledge, offering valuable insights for
   curriculum design and assessment. This approach can be adapted to
   evaluate the effectiveness of other curricular activities, such as
   tutoring or intersessions. The results have significant implications for
   educators revising clerkship content and for students preparing for the
   United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 2.

AB BACKGROUND: Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of
   maternal mortality worldwide, and effective training in PPH rescue
   techniques is crucial. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of
   combining case-based learning (CBL) and problem-based learning (PBL)
   with simulation teaching methods in improving midwifery trainees'
   technical proficiency in managing PPH.
   METHODS: This quasi-experimental study involved 76 trainees who received
   PPH training at Peking University Third Hospital from March to July
   2023. They were divided into two groups: the control group (n=50)
   followed traditional simulation training methods, and the research group
   (n=26) used a combination of CBL-PBL and scenario simulation. After the
   training, all participants completed a theoretical examination and
   questionnaire to assess their satisfaction with the program and
   self-assessment of clinical management skills in PPH. Statistical
   analysis was performed using unpaired t-tests and chi-square tests to
   compare the groups.
   RESULTS: The combination of CBL-PBL and scenario simulation was highly
   satisfactory compared to traditional simulation training, significantly
   enhancing self-assessed skills in clinical thinking (100% vs. 61.8%,
   p=.03), operant skills related to PPH (100% vs. 57.4%, p<.01), relevant
   knowledge pertaining to PPH (100% vs. 58.7%, p<.01), and management
   abilities (97.1% vs. 39%, p<.01) among midwifery trainees in the
   research group, who also scored significantly higher on post-training
   assessments of PPH knowledge than control groups(91.7±6.0 vs 76.0±7.1,
   p<.01). A majority of trainees expressed a preference for regular
   simulation exercises (98.7%) and detailed discussions on PPH cases
   (93.4%) in future training sessions.
   CONCLUSION: Combining CBL-PBL with simulation practice is a more
   effective teaching method for PPH management training in maternity
   staffs with a certain level of clinical experience, compared to
   traditional methods. Future studies should explore the implementation of
   regular PPH rescue skill training in real clinical settings to support
   these findings.
AB Postpartum haemorrhage remains the leading cause of maternal mortality
   worldwide. It is crucial for all midwifery practitioners to receive
   comprehensive and proficient training in postpartum haemorrhage
   management techniques. Although simulation teaching is widely used in
   postpartum haemorrhage technical training, its effectiveness may be
   hindered by a limited range of scenarios and inflexible scripts,
   potentially compromising its ability to fully address training
   objectives. To overcome these limitations, we integrated case-based
   learning (CBL) rooted in the analysis of medical records to recreate
   real-life clinical scenarios with problem-based learning (PBL), which is
   characterised by independent study, group discussions, and collaborative
   problem-solving. Our study demonstrated that this combined CBL-PBL
   teaching methodology, along with simulation practice among maternity
   staffs with a certain level of clinical experience, was highly effective
   in enhancing self-assessment of skills including clinical thinking,
   operant skills related to postpartum haemorrhage, relevant knowledge
   pertaining to postpartum haemorrhage, and management abilities among
   midwifery trainees. However, it should be noted that there are several
   limitations in this study including an unrandomized quasi-experimental
   design and a greater emphasis on vaginal delivery practices.
   Additionally, the effectiveness of this approach in actual clinical
   practice has not been evaluated yet. Further research should focus on
   incorporating regular training on postpartum haemorrhage rescue skills
   and evaluating their efficacy in real clinical settings to ensure
   comprehensive preparedness among midwifery professionals for managing
   postpartum haemorrhage and other obstetric emergencies while reducing
   maternal mortality rates.

AB Objective: This study aimed to investigate spousal information
   concealment in patients with cancer and analyse its influencing factors.
   Methods: Between April and July 2024, 371 spouses of patients with
   cancer were surveyed using the Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
   Questionnaire, the Information Concealment Scale for Caregivers, Fear of
   Progression Questionnaires for Partners, and the Medical Coping Modes
   Questionnaire. Influencing factors were analysed using latent profile
   analysis. Results: Based on the degree of information concealment,
   spouses of patients with cancer were categorised into three subgroups:
   the low concealment - low control (19.14%), medium concealment (50.40%),
   and high concealment - high dissimulation group (30.46%). Multivariate
   logistic regression analysis revealed that sex, age, educational level,
   disease stage, fear of disease progression, and medical coping modes
   were the influencing factors of the information concealment subgroups
   (P<0.05). Conclusions: Information concealment among spouses of patients
   with cancer has individualized characteristics. Analysing the
   demographics, disease features, and psychological conditions of spouses
   in different information concealment subgroups can help medical staff
   formulate more targeted and personalized interventions and reduce the
   degree of information concealment among patients'spouses.

   and reconstruction (3D-IPR) combined with virtual reality (VR)
   technology and printed models (PM) as teaching tools in oncological
   colorectal surgery.MethodsWe designed two courses, one for general
   surgery trainees and another for young colorectal surgeons, structured
   around stations of pre-test, anatomical lessons, real-case
   presentations, 3D-IPR models, VR experiences, and life-size abdominal PM
   with surgical approach explanations and a final
   post-test.ResultsFourteen course participants were evaluated. Pre-test
   scores averaged 5.15, with a median of 5.5, while post-test scores
   increased to an average of 7.75, with a median score of 8. Course
   satisfaction surveys indicated high ratings for expectations, duration,
   relevance, presenter knowledge, teaching materials, communication, and
   overall course segments, with an average rating exceeding 4.8 out of 5.
   Results highlight the potential of 3D-IPR, VR, and PM as tools for
   improving teaching for surgery residents and colorectal surgeons. These
   technologies offer immersive, risk-free experiences for learners,
   potentially enhancing skill acquisition and anatomical
   understanding.ConclusionThis study demonstrates the effectiveness of
   3D-IPR, VR, and PM courses in improving understanding of colorectal
   surgery. As these technologies continue to advance, they offer enhanced
   immersion and accessibility, transforming surgical education and medical
   training.

AB BackgroundTreating high horseshoe anal fistula (HHAF) with the modified
   Halley procedure (MHP) often falls short when focusing solely on deep
   postanal space (DPAS) drainage. Our study underscores the significance
   of addressing deep posterior intersphincteric space (DPIS) drainage,
   prompting MHP modifications. MethodsWe studied consecutive patients with
   HHAF treated with either MHP or remodified-MHP (Re-MHP) at Ningbo
   Medical Center of Lihuili Hospital from January 2018 to December 2021.
   Postoperative outcomes, encompassing complications, cure rates, pain,
   anal incontinence, and quality of life, were retrospectively assessed.
   ResultsCure rates for MHP and Re-MHP were 95.3% (41/43) and 82.1%
   (32/39), respectively, without statistical significance (chi 2 = 3.7, P
   = 0.08). VAS-PS, CCF-IS, and QLAF-QS scores significantly increased
   postsurgery and gradually decreased. Notably, Re-MHP demonstrated
   significantly lower VAS-PS scores during the first postoperative week,
   lower QLAF-QS scores on the seventh day, and more drainage secretions on
   the first day (P < 0.05). ConclusionSimultaneously enhancing DPAS and
   DPIS drainage in Re-MHP can enhance the cure rates of HHAF patients
   while preserving minimally invasive attributes.

AB Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported
   in patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI), providing insights
   into disease pathogenesis. Here, we present the first case of MIS-C in a
   child affected by Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) gene mutation,
   elucidating underlying predisposing factors and the involved
   inflammatory pathways. Genetic analysis revealed a frameshift truncating
   variant in the WAS gene, resulting in WAS protein expression between
   mild and severe forms, despite a clinical phenotype resembling X-linked
   thrombocytopenia (XLT). IL-1 beta secretion by LPS-stimulated peripheral
   blood mononuclear cells from patient during MIS-C was lower compared to
   healthy subjects but increased during follow-up. Conversely, the
   percentage of ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a
   CARD) specks in the patient's circulating monocytes during the acute
   phase was higher than in healthy subjects. The type I interferon (IFN)
   signature during MIS-C was normal, in contrast to the raised IFN
   signature measured far from the acute event. This case supports the
   association of IEI with MIS-C, potentially linked to delayed immune
   responses to SARS-CoV-2. The XLT phenotype underlies a subclinical
   immunodysregulation involving the NLRP3 inflammasome and the type-I IFN
   response.

AB Purpose In aging populations, the Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung
   Disease (GOLD) spirometry threshold may misclassify normal spirometry as
   airflow limitation. The Global Lung Initiative (GLI) method provides
   age-adjusted criteria. We investigated how the use of GOLD or GLI
   thresholds in an algorithm affects the classification of elderly smokers
   into COPD risk phenotypes.Methods Using a modified COPDGene algorithm,
   including exposure, symptoms, and abnormal spirometry, 200 smokers aged
   60 years and older were classified into 4 mutually exclusive phenotypes:
   Phenotype A (no symptoms, normal spirometry; reference), Phenotype B
   (symptoms, normal spirometry; possible COPD), Phenotype C (no symptoms,
   abnormal spirometry; possible COPD), and Phenotype D (symptoms, abnormal
   spirometry; probable COPD). Abnormal spirometry was defined according to
   the GOLD or GLI criteria. A comparison was made between the GOLD- and
   GLI-defined phenotypes.Results Using GLI criteria/cut-offs, 18.5% (n =
   37) had phenotype A (no COPD), 42% (n = 84) had phenotype B (possible
   COPD), 7.5% (n = 15) had phenotype C (possible COPD), and 32% (n = 64)
   had phenotype D (probable COPD). Using GOLD criteria cut-offs, 14.5%
   (n-29) had phenotype A (no COPD); 31% (n = 62) had phenotype B, 11.5% (n
   = 23) had phenotype C (probable COPD), and 43% (n = 86) had phenotype D
   (probable COPD). Eight smokers with GOLD phenotype C were reclassified
   as GLI phenotype A, while 22 with GOLD phenotype D were reclassified as
   GLI phenotype B. Smokers identified as "probable COPD" by GOLD alone
   (potential false positives) had better spirometry results than those
   identified as "probable COPD" by both GOLD and GLI.Conclusion The use of
   the GOLD threshold in an algorithm resulted in older smokers being
   classified into more severe COPD risk phenotypes compared to the GLI
   threshold. This suggests that GOLD may misclassify smokers with less
   affected phenotypes as having respiratory impairment, potentially
   leading to unnecessary and harmful treatments.

   such as proliferation, cell cycle progression, differentiation, DNA
   damage repair, tissue homeostasis, angiogenesis, apoptosis, redox
   signaling, and drug resistance. In recent years, an increasing number of
   studies have focused on the role of FOXM1 in the occurrence of multiple
   diseases and various pathophysiological processes. In the field of
   pulmonary diseases, FOXM1 has a certain reparative effect by promoting
   cell proliferation, regulating cell cycle, antifibrosis, participating
   in inflammation regulation, and synergizing with other signaling
   pathways. On the basis of the repair properties of FOXM1, this review
   explores its therapeutic potential in acute lung injury/acute
   respiratory distress syndrome, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary
   disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension,
   lung cancer, and other lung diseases, with the goal of providing a new
   perspective for the analysis of FOXM1-related mechanism of action and
   the expansion of clinical treatment strategies.

AB ObjectivesExamine the association of asthma, COPD, and Asthma-COPD
   overlap (ACO) on rates of lung cancer screening.Methods2022 Behavior and
   Risk Factors Surveillance Survey was used for cross-sectional analysis
   of self-reported lung cancer screening prevalence in those with COPD,
   asthma, and ACO, with stratification by smoking status. Multivariate
   logistic regression was performed to assess the relationship between
   asthma, COPD, ACO and lung cancer screening status.Results17.9% of
   eligible adults were up-to-date on lung cancer screening. Those with
   COPD and ACO had higher rates of ever undergoing lung cancer screening
   (50.8% and 47.5%) than those with asthma (26.4%) or neither condition
   (23%). Adults with COPD (adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.86, 95% CI
   2.49-3.28) and ACO (aOR: 2.85, 95% CI 2.49-3.28) had increased odds of
   ever having lung cancer screening compared with those without either
   condition. Stratification by smoking status shows that individuals who
   formerly smoked had slightly higher odds of ever undergoing screening
   than individuals currently smoking.ConclusionLung cancer screening rates
   have increased; however, it remains low. Adults with COPD and ACO are
   more likely to undergo lung cancer screening.

AB Marburg virus (MARV) is a zoonotic virus that can infect humans and
   non-human primates (NHPs) and lead to a fatal Marburg hemorrhagic fever
   (MHF), while there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment for
   MHF. The nucleic acid vaccine has unique advantages, including fast and
   simple preparation, easy to follow the virus mutation situation, and
   less adverse reactions. Therefore, we constructed the DNA and mRNA
   candidate vaccines based on codon-optimized MARV glycoprotein sequence,
   and evaluated the immune effect in mice through ELISA, ELISpot, and Flow
   cytometry. After the second booster immunization, both of the candidate
   vaccines induced strong humoral immune response, enhanced T cell
   response, and elicited neutralizing antibodies. Notably, DNA candidate
   vaccine induced stronger humoral immune response, while mRNA candidate
   vaccine elicited higher levels of IFN-gamma and IL-4. In addition,
   transcriptome analysis revealed that the candidate vaccines activated
   immune response related pathways. Our study shed new light on the
   nucleic acid vaccines for MARV and further confirmed the potential of
   nucleic acid vaccine for future MHF prevention and control.

AB One of the most famous and heterogeneous cancers worldwide is breast
   cancer (BC). Owing to differences in the gene expression profiles and
   clinical features of distinct BC subtypes, different treatments are
   prescribed for patients. However, even with more thorough pathological
   evaluations of tumors than in the past, available treatments do not
   perform equally well for all individuals. Precision medicine is a new
   approach that considers the effects of patients' genes, lifestyle, and
   environment to choose the right treatment for an individual patient. As
   a powerful tool, the organoid culture system can maintain the
   morphological and genetic characteristics of patients' tumors. Evidence
   also shows that organoids have high predictive value for patient
   treatment. In this review, a variety of BC studies performed on organoid
   culture systems are evaluated. Additionally, the potential of using
   organoid models in BC translational research, especially in
   immunotherapy, drug screening, and precision medicine, has been
   reported.

AB BackgroundMyocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MI/RI) significantly
   impacts the patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), with the
   NLRP3-mediated necrosis exacerbates the pathological progression of
   myocardial infarction. Exercise, recognized as a crucial approach for
   both disease prevention and treatment, is widely utilized in clinical
   practice worldwide and has demonstrated broad effectiveness in
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention.PurposeTo explore the cardio
   protective effect of exercise preconditioning and the mechanism by which
   exercise modulation of NLRP3 improves myocardial ischemia and
   reperfusion injury.Methods and resultsIn this study, C57BL/6 N mice were
   employed to establish an exercise preconditioning model and a MI/RI
   model. The exercise intervention involved moderate-intensity aerobic
   exercise on a treadmill (50-70% VO2max) for small animals. Our research
   findings indicate that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention
   improved cardiac function, reduced myocardial injury and inflammatory
   response, decreased myocardial infarction area and degree of cell
   apoptosis in mice compared to those raised under conventional
   conditions. Additionally, the expression of NLRP3 in the myocardial
   tissue of mice with MI/RI was reduced after exercise intervention.
   Moreover, exercise inhibited the activation of apoptosis related
   proteins such as Caspase-1 and GSDMD, while reducing the levels of
   inflammatory factors such as IL-1 beta and IL-18.ConclusionsThis study
   found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise can reduce the
   inflammatory response, reduce the degree of cell pyroptosis, reduce
   myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury, and achieve endogenous
   protective effects on the myocardium.

AB In the intestinal tract, where numerous intestinal bacteria reside,
   intestinal epithelial cells produce and release various antimicrobial
   molecules that form a complex barrier on the mucosal surface. These
   barrier molecules can be classified into two groups based on their
   functions: those that exhibit bactericidal activity through chemical
   reactions, such as antimicrobial peptides, and those that physically
   hinder bacterial invasion, like mucins, which lack bactericidal
   properties. In the small intestine, where Paneth cells specialize in
   producing antimicrobial peptides, the chemical barrier molecules
   primarily inhibit bacterial growth. In contrast, in the large intestine,
   where Paneth cells are absent, allowing bacterial growth, the primary
   defense mechanism is the physical barrier, mainly composed of mucus,
   which controls bacterial movement and prevents their invasion of
   intestinal tissues. The expression of these barrier molecules is
   regulated by metabolites produced by bacteria in the intestinal lumen
   and cytokines produced by immune cells in the lamina propria. This
   regulation establishes a defense mechanism that adapts to changes in the
   intestinal environment, such as alterations in gut microbial composition
   and the presence of pathogenic bacterial infections. Consequently, when
   the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier is compromised, commensal
   bacteria and pathogenic microorganisms from outside the body can invade
   intestinal tissues, leading to conditions such as intestinal
   inflammation, as observed in cases of inflammatory bowel disease.

AB Objective: Lung cancer and its prolonged treatment are profoundly
   unsettling for patients and their family caregivers, and developing
   dyadic measures to alleviate their negative affectivity is pivotal. This
   study aimed to develop a complex intervention to alleviate dyadic
   psychological stress among patients with lung cancer and their family
   caregivers. Methods: A stepwise multi-method study was conducted
   following the Medical Research Council framework. Three phases were
   adopted, namely: (1) a preparation phase, a systematic review was
   conducted to identify the evidence base, (2) a development phase,
   empirical data from a quantitative study and a qualitative study were
   integrated to identify effective components, and (3) a modification
   phase, an online Delphi survey was carried out to refine the
   intervention. Results: The dyadic Mindfulness Self-Compassion
   intervention developed in this study consists of six weekly sessions.
   The key components of the intervention include: (1) getting along with
   cancer (introductory session targets illness perception), (2) practising
   mindful awareness (core session for mindfulness), (3) defining dyadic
   relationships and introducing self-compassion (core session for
   self-compassion), (4) promoting dyadic communication (maintenance
   session targets communication skills), (5) promoting dyadic coping
   (maintenance session targets coping skills), and (6) a summary session
   reviewing the rewards and challenges of dyadic adaptation named
   embracing the future. Conclusions: An evidence-based, theory-driven, and
   culturally appropriate dyadic Mindfulness Self-Compassion intervention
   was developed for patients with lung cancer and their family caregivers.
   Future studies are warranted to pilot and evaluate the usability,
   feasibility, acceptability, satisfaction, and effectiveness of this
   complex intervention. Trial registration: ClinicalTrial.gov NCT04795700.

AB Purpose Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a common and severe
   complication in premature neonates, leading to long-term neurological
   impairments. Early prediction and identification of risk factors for IVH
   in premature neonates are crucial for improving clinical outcomes. This
   study aimed to predict IVH in premature neonates and determine risk
   factors using machine learning (ML) algorithms.MethodsThis study
   investigated the medical records of premature neonates admitted to the
   neonatal intensive care unit. The patients were labeled as case (IVH)
   and control (No IVH). The independent variables included demographic,
   clinical, laboratory, and imaging data. Machine learning algorithms,
   including random Forest, support vector machine, logistic regression,
   and k-nearest neighbor, were used to train the models after data
   preprocessing and feature selection. The performance of the trained
   models was evaluated using various performance metrics.ResultsData from
   160 premature neonates were collected including 70 patients with IVH.
   The identified risk factors for IVH were the gestational age, birth
   weight, low Apgar scores at 1 min and 5 min, delivery method, head
   circumference, and various laboratory findings. The random forest
   algorithm demonstrated the highest sensitivity, specificity, accuracy,
   and F1 score in predicting IVH in premature neonates, with a great area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99.ConclusionThis
   study revealed that the random forest model effectively predicted IVH in
   premature neonates. The early identification of premature neonates at
   higher risk of IVH allows for preventive measures and interventions to
   reduce the incidence and morbidity of IVH in these patients.

AB Wound management is a major global health problem. With the rising
   incidence of diabetic wounds, accidents, and other injuries, the demand
   for prompt wound treatment has become increasingly critical. Millions of
   people suffer from serious, large wounds resulting from major accidents,
   surgeries, and wars. These wounds require considerable time to heal and
   are susceptible to infection. Furthermore, chronic wounds, particularly
   in elderly and diabetic patients, often require frequent medical
   interventions to prevent complications. Consequently, wound management
   imposes a significant economic burden worldwide. The complications
   arising from wound infections can vary from localized issues to systemic
   effects. The most severe local complication of wound infection is the
   non-healing, which results from the disruption of the wound-healing
   process. This often leads to significant pain, discomfort, and
   psychological trauma for the patient. Systemic complications may include
   cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and septicemia. Mesenchymal stem cells are
   characterized by their high capacity for division, making them suitable
   candidates for the treatment of tissue damage. Additionally, they
   produce antimicrobial peptides and various cytokines, which enhance
   their antimicrobial activity. Evidence shows that phages are effective
   in treating wound-related infections, and phage therapy has proven to be
   highly effective for patients when administered correctly. The purpose
   of this article is to explore the use of bacteriophages and mesenchymal
   stem cells in wound healing and infection management.Graphical

AB Background. Paracetamol is a commonly prescribed drug, and often
   implicated in pharmaceutical overdoses. Paracetamol-induced
   hepatotoxicity is a common cause of acute liver failure in many
   high-income countries, but little is known about the factors associated
   with severity of liver injury and poor clinical outcomes among those
   treated in sub-Saharan African settings. Objective. To describe the
   characteristics of patients presenting with paracetamol poisoning, and
   to identify factors associated with severity of liver injury and poor
   outcomes in adults with biochemical evidence of paracetamol-induced
   liver damage treated at a South African (SA) tertiary hospital. Methods.
   A retrospective medical record review was conducted of all adult
   patients (>= 18 years old) admitted between August 2013 and August 2018
   to a tertiary referral centre in Cape Town, SA, with paracetamol
   poisoning and biochemical evidence of liver impairment. Demographics,
   clinical and laboratory data were obtained. Management practices and
   clinical outcomes were assessed. Results. The records of 91 patients
   were included in the analysis. The median (interquartile range (IQR))
   age was 29 (23- 39) years, and 63% were female. The majority of
   paracetamol poisonings followed an intentional overdose (91%). Acute
   single ingestions were the most common (81%) type of toxic ingestion,
   compared with staggered overdose and repeated supratherapeutic
   ingestion, and the median (IQR) number of tablets ingested was 22 (20-
   39). Two-thirds of patients developed mild liver injury and 12%
   developed acute kidney injury. The overall mortality rate was 12%.
   Mortality was lower in those who received intravenous N-acetylcysteine
   (NAC) before serum paracetamol concentrations were known compared with
   those who only received NAC after concentrations were known (8.8% v.
   36%, p =0.03). A significant proportion of deaths occurred in those with
   accidental overdose compared with those with intentional overdosing (57%
   v. 7.2%; p =0.004). People living with HIV (p=0.04), a history of
   chronic alcoholism (p=0.04), chronic liver disease (p =0.01) and
   severity of acute kidney stage (p <0.001) were all associated with
   increased mortality. Conclusion. A high case fatality rate was observed
   in the studied population. Early identification of at-risk individuals
   and prompt initiation of NAC can reduce poor outcomes. Larger
   multicentre studies are needed to identify independent predictors of
   paracetamol-induced hepatoxicity and mortality in Africa.

AB IntroductionThere is a history of research mistrust and lack of
   engagement in clinical research among Black people due to centuries of
   racism and medical neglect. However, it is critical that Black people
   are included in research, especially in gait analysis research, because
   we know there are racial differences in gait. Thus, the purpose of this
   study is to determine if Black research participants have the same
   attitudes toward research engagement and research mistrust as their
   White counterparts while participating in gait analysis
   research.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted. This work focuses
   on one portion of a larger study in which individuals were asked to
   complete two surveys related to research participation and mistrust and
   complete a gait assessment. Data were collected from 106 participants,
   44 of whom identified as Black or African American. Wilcoxon rank sum
   and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine if significant
   differences existed in responses by racial and racial-gender
   groups.ResultsWilcoxon rank sum tests found that factors associated with
   research engagement and feelings of research mistrust differed
   significantly between Black and White research participants.
   Additionally, Kruskal-Wallis tests and Dunn tests found significant
   differences among the racial-gender groups, especially when comparing
   White men and Black women.ConclusionThe findings show that in a gait
   analysis study, Black people have higher feelings of mistrust in medical
   research than White people and will likely be less willing to
   participate. These results could improve our understanding of why Black
   people are less likely to participate in research than White people,
   even in a gait analysis study. This work can provide insights into how
   to modify recruitment practices to increase participation of
   underrepresented groups in exercise science and biomechanics, such as
   racial concordance and promoting transparency.

AB Introduction Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare
   clinical entity in the paediatric population. Clinical presentation is
   mostly similar to adult counterpart and can include headaches, vomiting,
   papilloedema, deterioration in visual acuity or fields, and 6th cranial
   nerve palsy, leading to significant morbidity. Therapeutic lumbar
   puncture and medical treatment with acetazolamide are usually the
   first-line treatments. In a minority of refractory cases, particularly
   where visual function is threatened, CSF diversion has been
   traditionally used in clinical practice. CSF diversion in IIH patients
   can be associated with high rate of shunt malfunction and revision due
   to small ventricular size leading to repeated procedures. We describe
   our experience with cranial vault expansion as a method of treatment of
   paediatric IIH cases refractory to medical treatment as a CSF diversion
   sparing method. Methods Following review of IIH cases undergoing
   surgical treatment in our unit over 15 years (years 2009-2024), cases
   receiving cranial vault expansion as primary surgical treatment were
   selected and further analysed. Inclusion criteria were paediatric cases
   (age < 16) undergoing vault expansion as first surgical treatment for
   IIH refractory to pharmacological treatment for vision-threatening
   papilloedema. All cases were discussed within multidisciplinary meeting
   and selected following consideration of all management options. Results
   Over the studied period, we identified two cases of refractory IIH with
   severe papilloedema undergoing cranial vault expansion as primary
   shunt-sparing surgery. Both patients presented with symptoms of
   headaches, vomiting, and blurred vision with ophthalmological
   confirmation of severe papilloedema despite pharmacological therapy.
   Following multidisciplinary discussions, both underwent successful
   supratentorial vault expansion. Pharmacological treatment was
   discontinued in both cases following surgery. Evaluation at latest
   follow-up showed resolution of symptoms and papilloedema with no need
   for subsequent cerebrospinal fluid diversion at the latest follow-up.
   Conclusion Cranial vault expansion is a viable and safe alternative
   surgical option in paediatric IIH cases refractory to medical treatment
   obviating the need for repeated shunt procedures. In cases with

AB Purpose of reviewTo describe recent research relevant to factors which
   predispose to giant cell arteritis (GCA) and those which trigger its
   manifestation, with particular emphasis on the more recent and
   controversial associations (COVID-19, vaccination, novel medications)
   which have changed the medical landscape and perhaps GCA
   prevalence.Recent findingsGCA remains more prevalent in Caucasians but
   nevertheless affects other racial groups. Certain HLA haplotypes (i.e.
   DRB1*04) incurs risk of GCA. Polymyalgia rheumatica remains a strong
   association, and recent evidence also associates GCA with hematologic
   malignancy. COVID-19 infection may trigger GCA, in addition to
   vaccination (particularly the COVID-19 vaccine) and reactivated VZV
   infection, though the latter may be related to a common trigger.
   PD1-inhibitors may be associated with GCA. Previously establish patterns
   in geography and latitude are supported. A seasonal pattern of GCA in
   the summer/spring months is suggested but not proven.SummaryControversy
   regarding GCA risk factors exists, as well as to whether the overall
   prevalence of GCA is rising. Given the growing aging population, the
   total number of cases of GCA will certainly increase, a challenge to
   which that our healthcare system must continue to rise to meet.

AB Genetic variants in Folliculin interacting protein 1 (FNIP1) were
   recently discovered as monogenic causes for immunodeficiency and
   cardiomyopathy, with only a few patients diagnosed thus far. In this
   study, we describe a patient harboring a novel genetic variant in FNIP1
   causing immunodeficiency with cardiac involvement. Clinical and
   immunological workups were performed. Genetic evaluation utilizing
   whole-exome sequencing (WES) and Sanger sequencing was conducted. The
   index patient (subject II-4) presented with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,
   recurrent infections, and chronic diarrhea during infancy. Immune workup
   revealed agammaglobulinemia and a lack of B lymphocytes. Genetic
   evaluation identified a homozygous 13-bp duplication variant in FNIP1
   (c.52_64dupGCGCCCGGCCGCG, p. Asp22GlyfsTer21) resulting in a frameshift
   in exon 1/18. She was treated with supplemental intravenous
   immunoglobulins (IVIg) with good control of sinopulmonary and
   gastrointestinal manifestations. Her sibling (subject II-1) had similar
   clinical features, along with dysmorphic facial features and hypotony,
   and succumbed to cardiogenic shock at the age of 2 months, prior to
   genetic evaluation. Diagnosis of novel immunodeficiencies promotes our
   understanding of the immune system, enabling genetic counseling as
   herein, and may assist in the development of novel medical therapies in
   the future. FNIP1 loss-of-function should be considered in patients
   presenting in infancy with cardiac manifestations along with
   agammaglobulinemia (and B-cell lymphopenia).

AB In this article I present and review some of the most relevant
   challenges that social disciplines have raised about medically assisted
   human reproduction. I accompanied this review from the perspective of
   hope to understand phenomena such as the medicalization of reproduction
   and the transformations in social order as a result of assisted
   reproduction techniques. I recover this emotion from Adri & aacute;n
   Scribano's proposal (2023) to analyze hope in two senses. One of them
   has to do with how biomedicine commodifies the idea of reproduction and
   offers the hope of procreation. In a second sense, I think of hope as an
   emotion that users of these reproductive techniques construct to sustain
   their decision to become mothers. The discipline required to attend
   medical appointments, carry out the treatment indicated by the doctor,
   change eating habits, lifestyles, face family and social conflicts and
   emotional changes, among others, are examples of interstitial practices
   that allow us to observe and analyze the changes at the social,
   cultural, family composition and gender levels that are taking shape as
   a result of these techniques.

AB This article explores the experiences of patients undergoing palliative
   cancer treatment, with a focus on how they perceive and manage their
   health meanings and emotions in a complex, embodied context. The
   research is based on narratives from individuals receiving treatment at
   the outpatient department (OPD) of Crescent Valley Oncology Institute in
   Kolkata (a fictionalized name for ethical reasons). Given the lack of a
   clear sample frame of cancer patients, the study focuses on terminally
   ill cancer patients who visited the OPD between April and July 2005. The
   study employs in-depth qualitative research interviews to understand how
   each patient's experience of illness is shaped by their perception of
   their body, emotions, and its changes in the palliative care setting.
   The theoretical approach proposed in this study is the "Managing
   Meanings of Embodied Experiences" (MMEE) framework. MMEE is a three-fold
   framework that delves into how individuals navigate and interpret the
   meanings of their health experiences and emotions. The study examines
   how patients' body-selves are intertwined with their relationships with
   others, biomedical interventions, and the ongoing, dynamic nature of
   their physical, emotional, and psychological experiences. A key finding
   is that patients' embodied experiences and emotions are not static;
   rather, they evolve as they cope with their illness, make choices, and
   incorporate these experiences and emotions into their identities and
   relationships. This reflects what is termed the body-self-society
   'triad,' showing that the self, body, and emotions are in constant
   interaction with society and its medical structures.

AB To prevent infection, the experience of the recent severe acute
   respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) pandemic has led to
   recognition of the importance of not only vaccines but also the
   strengthening of mucosal barriers by secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA).
   Strong mucosal barrier provided by IgA is also possible to prevent
   allergies and chronic inflammatory conditions in the intestinal tract,
   since it can protect foreign enemies or antigens at the first line of
   defense before their invasion. Therefore, it is important to understand
   the role of IgA antibodies secreted by the mucosa of the body. In this
   section, we discuss the role of mucosal IgA antibodies in relation to
   three disease states: control of intestinal microbiota, protection
   against infection, and allergy. In addition, we provide the evidence in
   which the quality as well as the quantity of IgA is critical for disease
   prevention. Therefore, we discuss about novel strategies to enhance
   mucosal barriers by induction of high-quality IgA.

AB In image fusion, several images are combined into one image that
   contains information from all input images. In medical image analysis,
   image fusion can help to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment
   planning. One approach to image fusion is the saliency map, where an
   algorithm highlights the most informative regions of the image and then
   combines these regions into a single image. This method can be
   particularly useful in medical image analysis, where certain areas of an
   image may be especially critical. This study proposes a novel model for
   multi-head medical image analysis based on ResNet using the fusion of
   saliency maps and RGB images as input from medical images. The image
   fusion generated by saliency maps contains more visible features. The
   saliency maps generated with the pre-trained model also contain
   background information. A combined dataset from two publicly available
   sources containing three classes, healthy, COVID-19, and pneumonia X-ray
   images, was used to evaluate the proposed model. The proposed multi-head
   CNN model improves the average classification accuracy from 94.68 to
   96.72% with five-fold cross-validation. This approach could be
   implemented in an end-to-end computer-aided diagnosis system to shorten
   the evaluation time.

AB PurposeThis report aims to present a case of a child with holocord
   pilocytic astrocytoma and review the existing literature to provide
   insights into current management strategies.Case presentationAn
   11-month-old patient presented with progressive quadriplegia and was
   initially diagnosed with a spinal abscess. MRI revealed a
   heterogeneously enhancing cystic intramedullary lesion extending from
   the cervicomedullary region to the conus medullaris. The patient
   underwent an emergent T10-L1 total laminectomy and midline myelotomy for
   presumed abscess drainage. Intraoperative findings, however, were
   inconsistent with an abscess, suggesting a neoplastic process.
   Postoperative MRI indicated persistent spinal cord compression and
   histopathological examination showed no leukocytes or microorganisms. A
   second surgery the following day extended the laminectomy to T3,
   achieving gross total resection. Pathology confirmed a grade I pilocytic
   astrocytoma. Given the patient's age, chemotherapy with vincristine and
   carboplatin was initiated, as radiotherapy was unsuitable. Early
   physical therapy was commenced, resulting in significant neurological
   improvement to 4/5 muscle strength in all extremities according to the
   Medical Research Council (MRC) scale in the first year. Chemotherapy was
   discontinued due to systemic complications. At the 1-year follow-up, MRI
   demonstrated no tumor recurrence.ConclusionThe management of holocord
   pilocytic astrocytomas presents significant challenges, particularly in
   pediatric patients. While surgical resection remains the cornerstone of
   treatment, the role of chemotherapy requires further investigation. This
   case underscores the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach and
   highlights the potential for favorable outcomes with appropriate
   intervention.

   co-exist. This review discusses the comorbidity of atrial fibrillation
   and heart failure, the bi-directional link between them, and the recent
   advances in the management of these co-existing diseases.
   Recent Findings Catheter ablation received a class 1 A recommendation
   for patients with AF and HF, after overwhelming evidence in heart
   failure with reduced ejection fraction and end-stage heart failure,
   while clinical trials are still lacking in patients with preserved
   ejection. Guideline-medical therapy of heart failure decreases the
   incidence of atrial fibrillation and the progression of atrial myopathy.
   Summary Based on the current evidence, management of patients with both
   HF and AF should be include early optimization of comorbidity control,
   guideline-medical therapy for heart failure, and rhythm control
   preferentially through catheter ablation in properly selected patients.

AB Purpose of Review The authors evaluated current treatment options for
   carotid artery dissection, both medical and procedural.
   Recent Findings Recent evidence suggests that antithrombotic therapy is
   key for management of carotid artery dissection. Procedures are
   typically reserved for when medical management is ineffective, although
   novel classification systems for carotid artery dissection may better
   identify patients who will benefit from early procedural interventions.
   Summary Carotid artery dissections occur when a tear in the intima of
   the carotid artery allows for accumulation of intramural hematoma within
   the layers of the arterial wall. One of the more devastating outcomes is
   a stroke, and as such most management strategies center around treating
   acute stroke and preventing recurrence. More research is needed to
   determine the optimal approach to antithrombotic therapy.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. The use of
   computational methods to quantify changes that are not perceptible to
   the human eye is increasing in digital pathology imaging and has quickly
   improved detection rates at a low cost. Therefore, the present study
   aims to use complex computational shape markers as tools for automated
   analysis of the spatial distribution of cells in microscopy images of
   squamous cell lung carcinoma (SqCC). Photomicrographs from pathology
   glass slides in the LC25000 dataset were used in this study. Compared
   with those of the control, the fractal dimension (28%) and lacunarity
   (41%) of the cell nuclei changed in SqCC. The multifractal analysis
   revealed a significant difference in parameters Dq, alpha, and f(alpha)
   for all values of q (-10 to + 10), with a greater increase for more
   positive q values. The values at q + 10 increased by 34% for Dq, 36% for
   alpha, and 53% for f(alpha) in the SqCC images. The circularity, area,
   and perimeter also changed in the SqCC images. However, the parameters
   of aspect ratio, roundness, and solidity did not significantly differ
   between SqCC and benign tissue. The complex shape markers with the
   greatest changes in this study were the f(alpha) values for
   multifractality (53%) and lacunarity (41%). In conclusion, automated
   quantification of the spatial distribution of cell nuclei can be a fast,
   low-cost tool for evaluating the microscopic characteristics of SqCC;
   therefore, complex shape markers could be useful tools for software and
   artificial intelligence to detect lung carcinoma.

AB Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have
   identified a large number of susceptibility genes, but most of AD
   heritability remains unexplained, implying the existence of additional
   genes. Furthermore, the majority of the GWAS have been conducted in
   people of European descent, and the genes important for AD
   susceptibility in people of African descent have been underexplored. In
   this hypothesis-generating prospective cohort study, we genotyped 191
   African Americans (AAs) from three longitudinal cohorts on aging for the
   IgG3 allotype GM6, which is expressed exclusively in people of African
   descent, and assessed its interaction with IGHG, FCGRIIB, and HLA-DRB1
   genes. Cox proportional hazards modeling showed that GM6 by itself was
   not significantly associated with AD development. However, there was
   evidence of epistatic interaction: The risk of developing AD associated
   with GM6 positivity was significantly different (p = 0.0098) in
   non-GM17/GM17 participants compared with GM 17/GM17 participants.
   Specifically, in non-GM17/GM17 participants, the risk of AD was over
   fourfold higher in GM6-positive participants compared with GM 6-negative
   participants (HR = 4.63). Similarly, risk of developing AD associated
   with GM6 positivity was marginally different in non-FCGRIIB TT
   participants compared with FCGRIIB TT participants. In non-FCGRIIB TT
   participants, the risk of developing AD was over twofold higher in
   GM6-positive participants compared with GM6-negative participants (HR =
   2.44). This is the first report suggesting that immunoglobulin GM
   allotypes might play a role in AD etiology among AAs; however, since
   this was largely a hypothesis-generating study, replication in larger
   cohorts would be required to confirm this finding.

AB Receiving the measles vaccination is crucial for controlling the disease
   and preventing severe complications. However, adverse reactions can
   occur in individuals with inborn errors of immunity. This case report
   details a severe reaction to the measles vaccine in a ten-month-old
   female with a homozygous mutation in the IFNAR2 gene, leading to
   immunodeficiency-45. Following vaccination, she developed viremia,
   meningoencephalitis, and multi-organ failure. Genetic analysis
   identified a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) in the IFNAR2 gene,
   which is essential for type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling. This case
   highlights the importance of incorporating genetic screening into
   vaccination programs for individuals at risk. It demonstrates the
   complex relationship between genetic mutations and the immune responses
   to the vaccines.

   HSCT in C1q deficiency. Eighteen patients, fourteen previously
   unreported, from eleven referral centres, were included. Two patients
   had two HSCTs, thus 20 HSCTs were performed in total, at a median age of
   10 years (range 0.9-19). Indications for HSCT were autoimmune
   manifestations not controlled by ongoing treatment in seventeen, and
   early development of MALT lymphoma in one patient. Overall survival (OS)
   was 71% and event-free survival was 59% at two years (considering an
   event as acute GvHD >= grade III, disease recurrence and death). In
   eleven patients HSCT led to resolution of autoimmune features and
   discontinuation of immunosuppressive treatments (follow-up time range
   3-84 months). Five patients died due to transplant-related
   complications. Patients with a severe autoimmune phenotype, defined as
   neurological and/or renal involvement, had the worst OS (40% vs 84%; p =
   0.034). Reviewing data of 69 genetically confirmed C1q deficient
   patients, we found that anti-Ro antibodies are associated with
   neurologic involvement, and anti-RNP and anti-DNA antibodies with renal
   involvement. In conclusion, HSCT may be a valid curative option for C1q
   deficiency, but careful selection of patients, with an accurate
   assessment of risk and benefit, is mandatory.

AB Chronic neutropenia causes involve nutritional deficiencies and inborn
   errors of immunity(IEI), such as severe congenital neutropenia. To
   classify common chronic neutropenia causes in a pediatric immunology
   unit. We enrolled 109 chronic neutropenia patients admitted to a
   pediatric immunology department between 2002-2022. We recorded
   clinical/laboratory features and genetic characteristics. The
   male/female ratio was 63/46. Fifty-eight patients had parental
   consanguinity(57.4%). 26.6% (n = 29) patients had at least one
   individual in their family with neutropenia. Common symtpoms at
   presentation were upper respiratory tract infections(URTI)(31.1%), oral
   aphthae(23.6%), skin infections(23.6%), pneumonia(20.8%), and recurrent
   abscesses(12.3%). Common infections during follow-up were URTI(56.8%),
   pneumonia(33%), skin infections(25.6%), gastroenteritis(18.3%), and
   recurrent abscesses(14,6%). Common long-term complications were dental
   problems(n = 51), osteoporosis(n = 22), growth retardation(n = 14),
   malignancy(n = 16)[myelodysplastic syndrome(n = 10), large granulocytic
   leukemia(n = 1), acute lymphoblastic leukemia(n = 1), Hodgkin lymphoma(n
   = 1), EBV-related lymphoma(n = 1), leiomyosarcoma(n = 1), and thyroid
   neoplasm(n = 1)]. We performed a genetic study in 86 patients, and
   69(71%) got a genetic diagnosis. Common gene defects were HAX-1(n = 26),
   ELA-2 (ELANE)(n = 10), AP3B1(n = 4), and ADA-2(n = 4) gene defects. The
   IEI ratio(70.6%) was high. GCSF treatment(93.4%), immunoglobulin
   replacement therapy(18.7%), and HSCT(15.9%) were the treatment options.
   The mortality rate was 12.9%(n = 14). The most common long term
   complications were dental problems that is three times more common in
   patients with known genetic mutations. We prepared an algorithm for
   chronic neutropenia depending on the present cohort. An important rate
   of inborn errors of immunity, especially combined
   immunodeficiency(11.9%) was presented in addition to congenital
   phagocytic cell defects. Early diagnosis will allow us tailor the
   disease-specific treatment options sooner, preventing irreversible
   consequences.

AB Inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are a heterogeneous group of genetic
   diseases characterized by impaired immune system function. This
   prospective study aimed to determine the frequency, characteristics, and
   clinical course of IEI patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care
   unit (PICU) and identify mortality-related factors. Using a
   comprehensive immunological evaluation protocol, we screened 753 PICU
   admissions for potential IEIs during three years. Patients with
   pre-existing IEI diagnoses, chronic diseases, ongoing chronic medication
   regimens, other known comorbidities, trauma cases, post-surgical cases,
   and poisonings were excluded. Thirty-three patients were newly diagnosed
   with IEIs during or as a result of their PICU stay, representing an
   incidence of 4.39%. The most common disorders were immunodeficiencies
   with immune dysregulation (48.5%), followed by combined
   immunodeficiencies (24.2%). Severe viral infections (61%) and
   life-threatening infections (51.7%) were the most frequent warning
   signs. Only 31% of patients exhibited at least two Jeffrey Modell
   Foundation warning signs. The mortality rate was 58%, highlighting the
   need for early diagnosis and treatment. Newborn screening and family
   segregation studies are crucial to improving outcomes for IEI patients
   in intensive care settings.

AB Endophilin A2, the sole endophilin A family member expressed in
   hematopoietic cells, regulates various aspects of membrane dynamics,
   including autophagy and endocytosis. Recent studies in rodents highlight
   the essential role of endophilin A2 in modulating immune responses. Here
   we report a homozygous frameshift variant in the SH3GL1 gene
   (NM_003025.3:c.427delC; p.Leu143Serfs*9), detected by whole exome
   sequencing in a 14-year-old boy with predominantly antibody deficiency.
   The patient who is issued from a consanguineous Lebanese family,
   presents since the age of 18 months with recurrent respiratory tract
   infections, low peripheral B cell counts and pan-hypogammaglobulinemia,
   with no history of opportunistic infections. This defect is associated
   with decrease in switched memory B cells development, impaired in-vitro
   B cell proliferation and diminished in-vitro IgG production. The
   detected variant in SH3GL1 segregates with the disease in the family. It
   significantly decreases the expression of the protein in the patient's
   peripheral blood compared to healthy controls, thus confirming its
   pathogenicity. Interestingly, endophilin A2-deficient Sh3gl1-/- mice
   have been reported to present defects in germinal center B cell
   responses and in the production of high-affinity IgG. Our data suggests
   that endophilin A2 deficiency impairs antibody production in humans.
   Reporting further cases with mutations in SH3GL1 is needed to better
   characterize the inborn error of immunity linked to this gene.

AB Early diagnosis of inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) has been shown to
   reduce mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs. The need for early
   diagnosis has led to the development of computational tools that trigger
   earlier clinical suspicion by physicians. Primary care professionals
   serve as the first line for improving early diagnosis. To this end, a
   computer-based tool (based on extended Jeffrey Modell Foundation (JMF)
   Warning Signs) was developed to assist physicians with diagnosis
   decisions for IEIs in the primary care setting. Two expert-guided
   scoring systems (one pediatric, one adult) were developed. IEI warning
   signs were identified and a panel of 36 experts reached a consensus on
   which signs to include and how they should be weighted. The resulting
   scoring system was tested against a retrospective registry of patients
   with confirmed IEI using primary care EHRs. A pilot study to assess the
   feasibility of implementation in primary care was conducted. The scoring
   system includes 27 warning signs for pediatric patients and 24 for
   adults, adding additional clinically relevant criteria established by
   expert consensus to the JMF Warning Signs. Cytopenias, >= 2 systemic
   infections, recurrent fever and bronchiectasis were the leading warning
   signs in children, as bronchiectasis, autoimmune diseases, cytopenias,
   and > 3 pneumonias were in adults. The PIDCAP (Primary Immune Deficiency
   "Centre d'Atenci & oacute; Prim & agrave;ria" that stands for Primary
   Care Center in Catalan) tool was implemented in the primary care
   workstation in a pilot area. The expert-based approach has the potential
   to lessen under-reporting and minimize diagnostic delays of IEIs. It can
   be seamlessly integrated into clinical primary care workstations.

AB Purpose - The Latin American Society of Immunodeficiencies (LASID)
   Registry was established in 2009 to collect data on Inborn Errors of
   Immunity (IEI) patients in the region. Although several reports have
   been published regarding LASID data, this is the first report of the
   entire dataset. Methods - The European Society of Immunodeficiencies
   (ESID) donated the online platform in 2008. Data was collected from
   participating centers from Apr 13, 2009, to Dec 31, 2022, and included
   demographic, clinical, and follow-up information. Results - A total of
   9307 patients were included in the database. At the end of the study
   period, 8,805 patients were alive or lost to follow-up, and 502 were
   deceased. The most common type of IEI was predominantly antibody
   deficiency (PAD, 60.35%), and selective IgA deficiency was the most
   frequent diagnosis (1627 patients, 17.48%), followed by Common Variable
   Immune Deficiency (CVID, 1191 patients). Most patients (78.16%) were <=
   18 years old at inclusion, and the median age at diagnosis was 4.77
   years. The median time to diagnosis was 5.04 years. Antibiotics were
   prescribed in 32.3% of visits, followed by immunoglobulins (29.49% ).
   Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed in 5.03% of
   patients. Omenn syndrome was the most common disease in deceased
   patients, with a mortality rate of 52.63%. Conclusion - This study
   contributes to our understanding of IEIs in Latin America and highlights
   the importance of early diagnosis, appropriate treatments, and improved
   data collection to optimize patient outcome

AB BackgroundX-linked agammaglobulinaemia (XLA), caused by mutations in
   BTK, is characterised by low or absent peripheral CD19 + B lymphocytes
   and agammaglobulinaemia. The mainstay of treatment consists of
   immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT). As this cannot fully
   compensate for the immune defects in XLA, patients may therefore
   continue to be at risk of complications.ObjectivesTo describe the
   clinical outcomes of XLA patients in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong
   and evaluate current treatment strategies.MethodsPatients with a
   definitive diagnosis of XLA were included in this cross-sectional and
   retrospective analysis of clinical health outcomes. Data pertaining to
   diagnosis, infection incidence, IgG trough levels and lung function were
   collected and analysed.Results99 patients with a median age of 29.02
   years (IQR 12.83-37.41) and a total follow up of 1922 patient years,
   were included this study. The median age at diagnosis was 3.30 years
   (IQR 1.04-8.38) which decreased over time (p = 0.004). 40% of the cohort
   had radiological evidence of bronchiectasis. Risk of bronchiectasis was
   not significantly associated with clinical infection incidence (p =
   0.880) or IgG trough levels (p = 0.407). Two patients demonstrated novel
   complications, namely persistent norovirus infection, leading to
   haemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).ConclusionsDespite modern
   therapy, most XLA patients continue to experience complications, most
   notably bronchiectasis, likely due to absence of IgA/M in current
   therapies, but lack of B lymphocytes may also lead to additional
   sequalae. These data strongly support the need for further research,
   particularly that of curative modalities including HSCT and gene
   therapy.

AB X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) due to a mutation in Bruton's tyrosine
   kinase (BTK), leads to the arrested development of B cells at the pro-B
   cell stage. This results in absent B cells and severe
   hypogammaglobulinemia. XLA patients usually present with recurrent
   sinopulmonary infection. Bacterial infections are the commonest [2],
   fungal infections like Pneumocystis jirovecii, Aspergillus and Candida
   species are rarely reported and they are associated with mortality in
   XLA [3]. We report a 3.5-year-old boy with disseminated aspergillosis,
   an uncommon presentation of XLA. Despite treatment with antifungals,
   including voriconazole and amphotericin B, the patient succumbed to the
   illness. Genetic analysis revealed a pathogenic variant in the BTK gene
   (R28H), confirming XLA diagnosis. This case highlights the potential for
   severe fungal infections in XLA patients and suggests broader immune
   system dysregulation beyond B-cell defects.

AB Purpose of ReviewThis review summarizes key implementation strategies to
   advance oral and long-acting PrEP delivery for unstably housed people in
   the United States.Recent FindingsPeople experiencing homelessness and
   housing instability face barriers to PrEP uptake and adherence including
   lack of safe medication storage, competing basic needs, insurances
   issues, and/or mental health or substance use disorders. Recent
   advancements in HIV treatment and prevention provide evidence on
   high-touch, low-barrier implementation approaches to address these
   challenges. We compiled these approaches into a multi-component
   implementation strategy, "SHELTER", which includes: low-barrier primary
   care, case management, incentives, outreach, care coordination,
   multidisciplinary provider collaboration, data tracking, and robust
   provider-patient relationships.SummaryThe US has fallen short of our
   Ending the Epidemic targets, in part due to challenges in PrEP delivery
   for people experiencing housing instability. SHELTER provides a
   comprehensive approach for considering critical components of HIV
   prevention for this population that can be used in future oral and
   long-acting PrEP programs.

AB Background: Combination of various medical schools with modern medicine
   is one of the appropriate methods for diagnosing and treating diseases.
   Considering the expanded use of herbal remedies, this study aimed to
   investigate herbal remedies for Methods: Keywords related to medicinal
   plants and hypothyroidism were searched among titles and abstracts of
   papers published on PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus to find relevant
   papers published until the end of 2022. The quality of the extracted
   papers was assessed using JADAD scale. The data collected from the
   papers included general information, demographic characteristics of the
   participants, sample size in each group, type and duration of the
   intervention, doses of the herbs or extracts, side effects, and the
   effects of the intervention on thyroid function tests. The I2 index was
   used to measure the heterogeneity of the papers; if I2 statistic was
   above 50% or under 50%, the results of the papers were combined using
   random effect or fixed effect methods, respectively. Results: Five of
   the 301 papers extracted from the abovementioned databases were selected
   for systematic review and 4 for meta-analysis. Three of the papers were
   about the properties of Nigella sativa. The meta-analysis results showed
   that herbal medicines used in these papers significantly changed level
   of T4 (SMD=0.86 CI95%: 0.47-1.24), T3 (SMD=0.50 CI95%: 0.13-0.87), and
   TSH (SMD=-1.19 CI95%: -1.82-0.56) compared to placebo. Conclusions:
   Herbal medicines improved the results of thyroid function tests; their
   effects on TSH, T3, and T4 were strong, moderate, and mild,
   respectively.

AB Background: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly threatens
   immunocompromised patients. We aimed to investigate the clinical and
   paraclinical findings and consequences of COVID-19 in kidney
   transplantation recipients. Methods: In this retrospective study, kidney
   transplant recipients admitted to Ayatollah Rouhani, Shahid Beheshti,
   and Shahid Yahyanejad referral hospitals of Babol, North of Iran, with a
   diagnosis of COVID-19, were examined. Information such as demographic
   and laboratory findings, clinical symptoms, and treatments received was
   entered into pre-prepared questionnaires. Results: Out of the 35
   patients included in the study, 19 (54.3%) were males, and 16 (45.7%)
   were females. The mean age of patients was 47.46 +/- 11.28. Among the
   clinical symptoms, cough and decreased level of consciousness were
   associated with a higher mortality rate (P= 0.02). Furthermore, the
   mortality rate was found to be 17.1%. Creactive protein (CRP) level,
   oxygen saturation percentage, and diffuse lung involvement were
   significantly associated with COVID-19 mortality (p <0.05). In this
   study, no correlation was found between the amount of Cr and the outcome
   of COVID19 disease (P = 0.66), and also, no significant relationship was
   found between the amount of BUN and the outcome of COVID-19 (P = 0.46).
   Even the patient who was admitted with a Cr of 6.4 did not die and was
   discharged with a Cr of 3.4. Conclusion: Due to the higher mortality
   rate in transplant patients with COVID-19, the need for more clinically
   severe treatment and intensification of care in this group of patients
   is essential.

AB PurposeThis study presents a series of paediatric meningiomas and
   discusses aetiology, risk factors and outcomes with comparison to
   current literature.MethodsThis is a retrospective review of surgically
   treated paediatric meningiomas from three UK centres: the University
   Hospital of Wales, Alder Hey Children's Hospital and Royal Manchester
   Children's Hospital. Twenty-seven patients aged 16 and under at the time
   of their first procedure were identified over a 15-year period (1
   January 2007 and 1 March 2023). Electronic medical records were used to
   collect data on age at presentation, sex, location of tumour(s), extent
   of resection, histology, WHO grade, complications, outcomes and
   associated conditions, notably neurofibromatosis type 2
   (NF2).ResultsTwenty-seven patients underwent 39 procedures. There were
   13 males and 14 females. The median age was 13 years (range, 8 months to
   16 years). Twenty-one (75%) were WHO grade 1, 6 (21%) were grade 2 and 1
   (4%) was grade 3. Eight patients (30%) had confirmed NF2. Twelve
   patients (44%) were sporadic cases. Twenty-five percent and 50% were the
   recurrence rate in WHO grade 1 and 2 tumours, respectively.ConclusionThe
   risk of grade 1 tumour recurrence was higher than within the adult
   population. This may be due to histological features of paediatric
   meningiomas differing from the adult population, and therefore, the WHO
   grading system may not be reflective of recurrence risk. Future
   molecular profiling and larger studies are required given the rarity of
   these cases.

AB Purpose A review of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) and mapping
   (IONMa) utility during paediatric tethered cord surgery with particular
   attention to feasibility, measures to prevent injury, and postoperative
   outcome. Methods A retrospective analysis of spinal cord untethering
   surgery between 2015 and 2022 was carried out. Cohort demographics, IONM
   and IONMa data, and procedural details were summarised and associations
   between variables explored. Clinical outcome was assessed 3-months post
   procedure via review of medical records. Results One hundred and
   twenty-two patients (median age: 3 years old: IQR: 2-9, 61% female)
   underwent surgery. The most common diagnosis was thickened filum (n =
   59, 48%). Urological dysfunction was the most common presenting
   complaint (62%). Electromyography (EMG), motor evoked potentials (MEP),
   somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), and bulbocavernosus reflexes
   (BCR) were successfully recorded in 100%, 99%, 90%, and 73% patients.
   Unsuccessful BCR monitoring only occurred in females (p < 0.001). The
   Triggered-EMG protocol identified nerve rootlets adhered to the filum or
   tethering structure in 16% of the cohort. Alert criteria breaches (>
   30-50% reduction in SSEP, > 80% reduction in MEP amplitude, absent BCR)
   occurred in 13 patients (11%). These alert criteria breaches were
   reversed in 11 (85%) with no permanent neurological deficits. In 2
   (15%), alerts were irreversible, and one developed a permanent
   neurological deficit. Signs and symptoms of tethered cord had either
   stabilised (>= 64%), improved (>= 20%), or worsened (<= 4%) at 3-month
   postoperative review. Conclusion IONM and IONMa are useful and effective
   tools in monitoring and identifying neural tissue, which can guide safe
   cord untethering and lipoma resection. Our results validate IONM and
   IONMa in surgery for cord untethering.

AB Secondary Moyamoya syndrome (MMS) is a rare but serious complication of
   radiotherapy (RT) in patients with craniopharyngiomas. This report
   details the fatal clinical course in a 4-year-old girl with a recurrent
   craniopharyngioma and a missed diagnosis of RT-induced Moyamoya
   syndrome. Her clinical condition deteriorated a day after uneventful
   re-exploratory transcranial surgery. She succumbed to bilateral internal
   carotid artery territory infarcts that were angiographically confirmed
   to be secondary to MMS. This case underscores the importance of
   diagnosing RT-induced vasculopathy, a complication that can occur as
   early as 10 months after completion of RT. Treatment of the condition
   includes medical management and performing revascularization
   procedure(s). If these patients require re-exploratory surgery for tumor
   recurrence, a trans-nasal approach should be used. This avoids the
   disruption of existing trans-dural collaterals-a phenomenon that could
   occur with transcranial surgery.

AB Purpose of ReviewCurrent high-efficacy disease-modifying therapies for
   multiple sclerosis (MS) primarily target adaptive immune cells in
   peripheral tissues, controlling focal inflammation (acute relapses and
   magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] activity). However, there is a need for
   new, safe therapies that address disease progression and disability
   accumulation in relapsing and progressive MS. The CD40/CD40L pathway,
   which regulates adaptive and innate immunity, is implicated in MS
   pathogenesis, making it a potential therapeutic target. Early clinical
   trials of anti-CD40L antibodies showed encouraging efficacy in
   autoimmune indications but were discontinued due to thromboembolic risk.
   Recent therapeutic advancements now allow researchers to leverage this
   pathway while reducing safety risks.Recent FindingsFrexalimab is a
   humanized anti-CD40L immunoglobulin-G1 monoclonal antibody,
   Fc-engineered to overcome thromboembolic risk. It is the first
   second-generation anti-CD40L antibody being investigated in MS. In a
   randomized-controlled phase 2 trial, frexalimab was well-tolerated,
   showing rapid and sustained reduction in disease activity (assessed by
   MRI) while preserving lymphocyte levels.SummaryRecent clinical findings
   strengthen the rationale for targeting CD40L in MS, supporting further
   development of anti-CD40L antibodies as potential high-efficacy,
   non-lymphocyte-depleting MS therapy. Further research is needed to
   understand the role of this pathway in MS pathogenesis and explore CD40L
   inhibition to address neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, where
   unmet medical needs exist.

AB Objective This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of
   laparoscopic-assisted radical surgery for right hemicolonic cancer with
   a combined approach. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of
   clinical data from 102 patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted
   radical right hemicolectomy for right hemicolonic cancer at the
   Department of General Surgery, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical
   University, between January 2021 and September 2023. All patients
   received preoperative diagnoses of right hemicolonic cancer via CT and
   e-colonoscopy. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the
   surgical approach: the combined approach group (n = 51) and the
   traditional approach group (n = 51). Perioperative outcomes and
   follow-up data were compared between the two groups. Results A total of
   102 patients were included in the statistical criteria. Comparison of
   baseline data between the two groups showed no statistically significant
   differences (all p > 0.05). Compared with the traditional access group,
   the surgical stem-oriented combined access group had a shorter operative
   time [(180.69 +/- 47.484) min vs. (226.18 +/- 45.884) min, t = - 4.920,
   p < 0.001] and less intraoperative blood loss [(89.71 +/- 79.350) ml vs.
   (149.31 +/- 104.633) ml. Z = - 3.370, p = 0.001. Conclusions Surgical
   stem-oriented modified combined approach laparoscopic radical right
   hemicolectomy for right hemicolonic cancer is safe and feasible and has
   the advantages of low surgical difficulty, shortened operative time,
   reduced intraoperative bleeding, and accelerated postoperative recovery.
   In addition, the combined approach may be more agreeable for beginners
   to master, and the procedure may be easier to promote and popularize.

AB IntroductionObesity is a chronic condition affecting around 650 million
   adults globally, with significant health implications such as
   cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide 1
   (GLP-1) medications have shown efficacy in promoting weight loss among
   obese individuals, although the weight loss is associated with undesired
   muscle breakdown. In this study, we investigate the psychosocial
   determinants of resistance training (RT) behavior among GLP-1 medication
   users, utilizing the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation Behavior
   (COM-B) model.MethodsA 1-wk longitudinal study design was adopted,
   involving members of a medical weight loss program (95.3% female; body
   mass index, 32.8 +/- 7.0 kg<middle dot>m-2, 48.8 +/- 9.9 yr old),
   assessing correlates of RT participation through an online
   survey.ResultsPsychological capabilities (b = 0.39, standard error (SE)
   = 0.14; P = 0.004) and reflective motivation had direct effects on
   frequency (b = 1.27, SE = 0.52; P = 0.02). Automatic motivation (b =
   3.40, SE = 1.22; P = 0.005) and physical opportunities (b = 2.05, SE =
   0.92; P = 0.02) had direct effects on duration, and psychological
   capabilities (b = 0.41, SE = 0.18; P = 0.03) and automatic motivation (b
   = 0.27, SE = 0.13; P = 0.04) had direct effects on intensity.
   Psychological capabilities directly or indirectly influenced all RT
   participation characteristics, suggesting a critical role of planning
   and self-monitoring in fostering RT adherence.ConclusionFor GLP-1 users
   engaging in RT, targeted behavioral interventions may be useful to
   mitigate muscle loss. Behavior change strategies should focus on
   psychological capabilities integrating planning and self-monitoring to
   enhance RT participation, with future research needed to confirm these
   results in more diverse and larger populations.

AB Introduction: For 15 yr, the Exercise is Medicine (R) On Campus (EIM-OC)
   initiative has called upon colleges and universities to promote physical
   activity on their campuses. To date, there are no reports describing the
   distribution of EIM-OC programs across the United States, and it is
   unclear what factors best position programs to achieve gold-level
   status. The purpose of this study was to perform a national analysis of
   the 2023 recognized EIM-OC programs. Methods: We identified the
   locations of the EIM-OC programs (American College of Sports Medicine
   (ACSM) regional chapter, state, county, city) and described their
   characteristics (school size, presence of kinesiology-related degree
   program, type of healthcare services offered, presence of a medical
   school). Data were obtained from websites, and differences between
   bronze, silver, and gold recognition levels were assessed. Results: Of
   the 131 EIM-OC programs, 19, 50, and 62 were bronze, silver, and gold
   levels, respectively. Thirty-seven states had at least one EIM-OC
   program, and 27 states had a gold-level program. The Southeast, Midwest,
   and Mid-Atlantic ACSM regional chapters had the most total (all >= 20)
   and gold-level (all >= 12) EIM-OC programs. Nearly 90% of total and
   gold-level EIM-OC programs were in metropolitan counties. Eighty-six
   percent of EIM-OC programs had a kinesiology-related degree program, 76%
   had student-centered health services on campus, and 28% had a medical
   school; however, there were no differences between bronze (P = 0.56),
   silver (P = 0.11), and gold (P = 0.12) levels. School (similar to
   215-68,000 students; P = 0.21), city (similar to 690-2,700,000 people; P
   = 0.14), and county (similar to 9,500-10,000,000 people; P = 0.32)
   populations for EIM-OC programs ranged considerably and did not differ
   across recognition levels. Conclusion: In the United States, colleges
   and universities with a broad range of locations, sizes, and
   infrastructures have used EIM-OC to promote physical activity. A
   kinesiology-related degree program and student healthcare services on
   campus are key assets for implementation, regardless of recognition
   level. There are fewer EIM-OC programs in select states, ACSM regions,
   and non-metropolitan areas. These findings may guide future EIM-OC
   promotion and implementation.

AB Background Patients with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) are susceptible
   to developing cancer due to defects in the immune system. The prevalence
   of cancer is higher in IEI patients compared to the immunocompetent
   population and cancers are considered as an important and common cause
   of death in IEI patients.
   Objectives To systematically review demographic, genetic and
   cancer-related data of IEI patients with a history of malignancy.
   Moreover, we performed a meta-analysis aiming to determine the frequency
   of cancer in patients with different types of IEI.
   Methods We conducted electronic searches on Embase, Web of Science,
   PubMed, and Scopus (until September 2023) introducing terms related to
   IEI and cancer. Studies with human subjects with confirmed IEI who had
   developed at least one malignancy during their lifetime were included.
   Results A total number of 4607 IEI patients with a cancer history were
   included in the present study. Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID)
   had the highest number of reported cases (1284 cases), mainly due to a
   higher relative proportion of patients with predominantly antibody
   deficiencies (PAD) and their increased life expectancy contributing to
   the higher detection and reporting of cancers among these patients. The
   most common malignancy was hematologic/blood cancers (3026 cases, mainly
   diffuse large B cell lymphoma). A total number of 1173 cases (55.6%)
   succumbed to cancer, with the highest rate of bone marrow failure
   (64.9%). Among the patients with monogenic defects in IEI-associated
   genes, the majority of cases had ATM deficiency (926 cases), but the
   highest cancer frequency rate belonged to NBS1 deficiency (50.5%). 1928
   cases out of total 4607 eligible cases had detailed data to allow
   further statistical analysis that revealed BRCA2 deficiency had the
   earliest cancer development (similar to 38 months), lowest cure
   frequency, and highest fatality rate (85%), while ATM deficiency had the
   lowest cure frequency and highest fatality rate (72%) among total cases
   reviewed with exclusion of Fanconi anemia.
   Conclusion The overall reported cancer frequency in the cases reviewed
   with and without exclusion of Fanconi anemia was 11.1% (95% confidence
   interval: 9.8-12.5%) and 12.0% (95% confidence interval: 10.6-13.5%),
   respectively. Our study revealed that the incidence of cancer is
   significantly dependent on the molecular and pathway defects in IEI
   patients, and individualized early screening and appropriate treatment,
   might improve the prognosis of these patients.

AB PurposeA causal role of type-I interferons (IFN-I) in autoinflammatory
   type-I interferonopathies such as SAVI (STING-associated vasculopathy
   with onset in infancy) and CANDLE (chronic atypical neutrophilic
   dermatosis with lipodystrophy and elevated temperatures) is suggested by
   elevated expression of IFN-I stimulated genes (ISGs). Hitherto, the lack
   of specific inhibitors of IFN-I signaling has prevented the verification
   of a causal role for IFN-I in these conditions. Commonly used inhibitors
   of the JAK/STAT pathway exert broad effects on multiple signaling
   pathways leading to more general immunosuppression beyond IFN-I
   signaling.MethodsHere we show in four patients with SAVI and one patient
   with CANDLE syndrome that blockade of the IFNAR1 receptor (Anifrolumab)
   exerts an additive effect over JAK-inhibitor alone. In two patients with
   SAVI, monotherapy with Anifrolumab is sufficient to retain a suppressed
   IFN-I signature and clinical improvement.ResultsAnifrolumab normalizes
   IFN-I signature genes and relieves symptoms beyond what is typically
   achieved by a JAK-inhibitor (Baricitinib) alone in patients with type-I
   interferonopathies. In two patients Anifrolumab was used successfully as
   monotherapy. Addition of Anifrolumab enabled steroid tapering and
   cessation with reduced overall immunosuppression and lower risks of
   opportunistic infections and improved metabolic states and growth which
   is highly beneficial in these young patients.ConclusionThese results
   verify a causal role of IFN-I signaling in type-I Interferonopathies
   SAVI and CANDLE and suggests Anifrolumab as an important new treatment
   option in autoinflammatory diseases with elevated IFN-I induced gene
   expression.Genia Kretzschmar, Laura Pi & ntilde;ero P & aacute;ez, and

AB Distinguishing between primary (PID) and secondary (SID)
   immunodeficiencies, particularly in relation to hematological B-cell
   lymphoproliferative disorders (B-CLPD), poses a major clinical
   challenge. We aimed to analyze and define the clinical and laboratory
   variables in SID patients associated with B-CLPD, identifying overlaps
   with late-onset PIDs, which could potentially improve diagnostic
   precision and prognostic assessment. We studied 37 clinical/laboratory
   variables in 151 SID patients with B-CLPD. Patients were classified as
   "Suspected PID Group" when having recurrent-severe infections prior to
   the B-CLPD and/or hypogammaglobulinemia according to key ESID criteria
   for PID. Bivariate association analyses showed significant statistical
   differences between "Suspected PID"- and "SID"-groups in 10 out of 37
   variables analyzed, with "Suspected PID" showing higher frequencies of
   childhood recurrent-severe infections, family history of B-CLPD,
   significantly lower serum Free Light Chain (sFLC), immunoglobulin
   concentrations, lower total leukocyte, and switch-memory B-cell counts
   at baseline. Rpart machine learning algorithm was performed to
   potentially create a model to differentiate both groups. The model
   developed a decision tree with two major variables in order of
   relevance: sum kappa + lambda and history of severe-recurrent infections
   in childhood, with high sensitivity 89.5%, specificity 100%, and
   accuracy 91.8% for PID prediction. Identifying significant clinical and
   immunological variables can aid in the difficult task of recognizing
   late-onset PIDs among SID patients, emphasizing the value of a
   comprehensive immunological evaluation. The differences between
   "Suspected PID" and SID groups, highlight the need of early, tailored
   diagnostic and treatment strategies for personalized patient management
   and follow up.

AB PurposeNewborn screening using dried blood spot (DBS) samples for the
   targeted measurement of metabolites and nucleic acids has made a
   substantial contribution to public healthcare by facilitating the
   detection of neonates with genetic disorders. Here, we investigated the
   applicability of non-targeted quantitative proteomics analysis to
   newborn screening for inborn errors of immunity (IEIs).MethodsDBS
   samples from 40 healthy newborns and eight healthy adults were subjected
   to non-targeted proteomics analysis using liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry after removal of the hydrophilic fraction. Subsequently,
   DBS samples from 43 IEI patients were analyzed to determine whether
   patients can be identified by reduced expression of disease-associated
   proteins.ResultsDBS protein profiling allowed monitoring of levels of
   proteins encoded by 2912 genes, including 1110 listed in the Online
   Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, in healthy newborn samples, and
   was useful in identifying patients with IEIs by detecting reduced levels
   of disease causative proteins and their interacting proteins, as well as
   cell-phenotypical alterations.ConclusionOur results indicate that
   non-targeted quantitative protein profiling of DBS samples can be used
   to identify patients with IEIs and develop a novel newborn screening
   platform for genetic disorders.

AB Objective FAS gene defects lead to autoimmune lymphoproliferative
   syndrome (ALPS), which is often inherited in an autosomal dominant and
   rarely in an autosomal recessive manner. We report a case of a newborn
   girl with novel compound heterozygous variants in FAS and reveal the
   underlying mechanism. Methods Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was used to
   identify pathogenic variants. Multiparametric flow cytometry analysis,
   phosflow analysis, and FAS-induced apoptosis assays were used to explore
   the effects of the variants on FAS expression, apoptosis, and
   immunophenotype. The HEK293T cells were used to assess the impact of the
   variants on protein expression and FAS-induced apoptosis. Results The
   patient was born with hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
   She also experienced COVID-19, rotavirus infection, herpes simplex virus
   infection, and severe pneumonia. The proportion of double-negative T
   cells (DNTs) was significantly elevated. Novel FAS compound heterozygous
   variants c.310T > A (p.C104S) and c.702_704del (p.T235del) were
   identified. The apoptotic ability of T cells was defective, and FAS
   expression on the surface of T cells was deficient. The T235del variant
   decreased FAS expression, and the C104S protein remained in the
   endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and could not translocate to the cell
   surface. Both mutations resulted in loss-of-function in terms of
   FAS-induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells. The DNTs were mainly terminally
   differentiated T (TEMRA) and CD45RA(+)HLA-DR+, with high expression of
   CD85j, PD-1, and CD57. The percentage of Th1, Tfh, and autoreactive B
   cells were significantly increased in the patient. The abnormal
   immunophenotyping was partially attenuated by sirolimus treatment.
   Conclusions We identified two variants that significantly affect FAS
   expression or localization, leading to early disease onset of in the
   fetus. Abnormalities in the mTOR pathway are associated with a favorable
   response to sirolimus.

   a clinical challenge with wide variability in etiology, presentation,
   work-up and management. In this article, we reviewed the evidence
   supporting various medical and surgical treatment options as well as the
   recent trends amongst pediatric surgeons.
   RECENT FINDINGS: Medical therapy is highly effective in most patients,
   with bowel management programs being particularly successful.
   Nonetheless, medically refractory disease, often seen in older children
   and in children with behavioral/psychiatric disorders, can be
   challenging. Sclerotherapy with ethanol or 5% phenol can be effective
   local treatments. 15% hypertonic saline, 50% dextrose, and Deflux are
   additional safe alternatives. Perianal procedures and perineal
   procedures are less invasive surgical options, but transabdominal
   rectopexy appears to be the favored treatment for disease refractory to
   local treatment. Transabdominal rectopexy with sigmoidectomy, the
   recommended operation in the adult population for patients with prolapse
   and constipation, appears only to be preferred in the pediatric
   population for postoperative recurrences.
   RECENT FINDINGS: While outcomes of medical treatment for pediatric
   rectal prolapse are excellent, sclerotherapy and transabdominal
   rectopexy are effective options for refractory disease preferred by most
   pediatric surgeons.

AB Introduction Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer with the
   second highest mortality worldwide in 2020. Adjuvant chemotherapy is
   given for stage II-III colorectal cancer. However, there are side
   effects that decrease the patient's quality of life. Several studies
   have found that vitamin D could reduce the side effects of chemotherapy,
   but studies at Hasan Sadikin Hospital have not been done. Methods A
   study regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the quality
   of life of stage II-III colorectal cancer patients undergoing adjuvant
   chemotherapy from May 2022 to April 2023 at Hasan Sadikin Hospital was
   conducted. A single-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with
   consecutive sampling was done at the digestive surgery outpatients. Data
   was taken from the medical record, history taking, and personal
   interviews. Quality of life was measured at the first, third, and sixth
   months after chemotherapy using the validated Indonesian version of the
   EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Results A total of 34 patients received
   vitamin D and 34 others received placebo. Serum vitamin D levels
   significantly increased (p < 0.001) in the intervention arm, from a
   median of 21.34 (5.26-29.95) to 27.92 (13.58-40.49). Meanwhile, it
   decreased in the placebo arm, from a median of 22.78 (8.3-29.93) to
   21.37 (7.45-31.26). The patient's quality of life improved significantly
   after receiving vitamin D, compared with the placebo group on the third
   (median of 75.0 vs 45.83) and sixth (median of 83.33 vs 33.33) months
   after chemotherapy. Conclusion Vitamin D consumption (10,000 IU/day)
   could improve the quality of life of colorectal cancer patients
   undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy.

AB ObjectiveGastric cancer ranks as one of the top five deadliest cancers
   worldwide and is often diagnosed at late stages. Analysis of saliva may
   provide a non-invasive approach for detection of malignancies in organs
   associated with the oral cavity. This research aims to analyze salivary
   microRNA expression together with clinical and demographic features with
   the aim of diagnosing gastric cancer.MaterialsThe study included 19
   patients with early-stage gastric cancer and 19 healthy controls. Saliva
   samples were collected and processed for RNA isolation. Salivary
   expression of miR-223-3p and miR-21-5p were measured using quantitative
   reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the
   accuracy of diagnostic models. Machine learning algorithms, multiple
   logistic regression, and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to
   assess the predictive power of miRNAs in conjunction with
   clinical-demographic features.ResultsSignificant upregulation of
   miR-223-3p and downregulation of miR-21-5p in saliva were observed in
   patients with gastric cancer. The area under ROC curve (AUC) values for
   salivary miR-21-5p, salivary miR-223-3p, and their multiple logistic
   regression were determined to be 0.723, 0.791, and 0.850, respectively.
   The AUC for multiple logistic regression model was 0.919. The PCA model
   led to the highest diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 134.33 (sensitivity =
   0.785, specificity = 1.00, AUC = 903). Application of machine learning
   methods, and in particular a random forest algorithm, showed high
   accuracy in diagnosing patients with gastric cancer (sensitivity = 1.00,
   specificity = 0.857, AUC = 0.93).ConclusionThe application of validated
   salivary diagnostics in clinical practice could help facilitate earlier
   diagnosis of gastric cancer and improve medical outcome. Expression of
   miR-21 and miR-223-3p in saliva together with clinical and demographic
   features, appears promising in screening for GC.

AB Background ISG15 deficiency is a mixed syndrome of Mendelian
   susceptibility to mycobacterial infections (MSMD), a rare inherited
   condition characterized primarily by recurrent infections from
   low-virulence mycobacteria and monogenic type I interferonopathy.
   ObjectiveTo characterize the laboratory and molecular features of two
   patients from different families affected by the same ISG15 variant.
   Methods We began with clinical characterization and investigation,
   assessed IL-12/IFN-gamma production, performed genetic characterization
   through WES and Sanger sequencing, conducted an in silico molecular
   analysis of the genetic ISG15 variant's protein impact, and utilized
   RNAseq for transcriptome analysis to understand pathway impacts on
   ISG15-deficient subjects from unrelated families. Results A mutation in
   the ISG15 gene was identified, affecting two patients treated in
   different hospitals and cities in Brazil (Fortaleza and Sao Paulo), who
   are also members of unrelated families. Both patients showed low
   IFN-gamma production when stimulated with BCG or BCG + IL-12. ISG15
   deficiency presented with two distinct clinical phenotypes: infectious
   and neurological. It was identified that both patients are homozygous
   for the variant (c.83 T > A). Furthermore, it was observed that the
   mutant protein p.L28Q results in an unstable protein with increased
   flexibility (Delta Delta G: -2.400 kcal/mol). Transcriptome analysis
   revealed 1321 differentially expressed genes, with significant
   upregulation in interferon pathways, showing higher expression in
   patients compared to controls. Conclusion This study describes the first
   reported cases in Brazil of two unrelated patients with the same ISG15
   mutation c.83 T > A, exhibiting infectious features such as
   mycobacterial infections and systemic candidiasis, neurological
   findings, and skin lesions, without adverse reactions to the BCG
   vaccine. Clinical Implications Reporting ISG15 gene mutations in
   Brazilian patients enhances understanding of genetic susceptibilities,
   guiding effective diagnostics and treatment. Identifying high-risk
   individuals aids clinical practices, genetic counseling, and influences
   public health policies. Capsule SummaryWe have identified the first case
   in Brazil of the same ISG15 variant c.83 T > A that was identified in
   two unrelated patients with distinct clinical phenotypes, infectious and
   neurological.

AB Purpose PI4KA-related disorder is a highly clinically variable condition
   characterized by neurological (limb spasticity, developmental delay,
   intellectual disability, seizures, ataxia, nystagmus) and
   gastrointestinal (inflammatory bowel disease and multiple intestinal
   atresia) manifestations. Although features consistent with
   immunodeficiency (autoimmunity/autoinflammation and recurrent
   infections) have been reported in a subset of patients, the burden of
   B-cell deficiency and hypogammaglobulinemia has not been extensively
   investigated. We sought to describe the clinical presentation and
   manifestations of patients with PI4KA-related disorder and to
   investigate the metabolic consequences of biallelic PI4KA variants in B
   cells. Methods Clinical data from patients with PI4KA variants were
   obtained. Multi-omics analyses combining transcriptome, proteome,
   lipidome and metabolome analyses in conjunction with functional assays
   were performed in EBV-transformed B cells. Results Clinical and
   laboratory data of 13 patients were collected. Recurrent infections
   (7/13), autoimmune/autoinflammatory manifestations (5/13), B-cell
   deficiency (8/13) and hypogammaglobulinemia (8/13) were frequently
   observed. Patients' B cells frequently showed increased transitional and
   decreased switched memory B-cell subsets. Pathway analyses based on
   differentially expressed transcripts and proteins confirmed the central
   role of PI4KA in B cell differentiation with altered B-cell receptor
   (BCR) complex and signalling. By altering lipids production and
   tricarboxylic acid cycle regulation, and causing increased endoplasmic
   reticulum stress, biallelic PI4KA mutations disrupt B cell metabolism
   inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. As a result, B cells show
   hyperactive PI3K/mTOR pathway, increased autophagy and deranged
   cytoskeleton organization. Conclusion By altering lipid metabolism and
   TCA cycle, impairing mitochondrial activity, hyperactivating mTOR
   pathway and increasing autophagy, PI4KA-related disorder causes a
   syndromic inborn error of immunity presenting with B-cell deficiency and
   hypogammaglobulinemia.

AB Granulomatous disease affects up to 20% of patients with Common Variable
   Immunodeficiency (CVID). Granulomas are comprised of highly activated
   immune cells, and emerge in response to antigenic triggers. In CVID
   granulomas however, the underlying pathophysiology is unclear and the
   specific trigger remains unknown. Granuloma formation in CVID is often
   compared to sarcoidosis, although clinical context and prognosis differ,
   suggesting a different pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to
   investigate if the cellular organization and proteomics of granulomas in
   CVID is different from other granulomatous diseases. Therefore, tissue
   slides from formaldehyde fixed paraffin embedded biopsies obtained from
   patients with CVID, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis and foreign-material
   induced pseudo-sarcoidosis were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and
   assessed for histopathological characteristics. Targeted spatial protein
   analysis was performed, and immune fluorescent multiplex assays were
   used to analyze the cellular organization. Histological analysis
   revealed that CVID granulomas were smaller, less circumscribed, with
   fewer multinucleated giant cells and minimal fibrosis compared to the
   other granulomatous diseases. Spatial protein analysis showed that
   granulomas in all diseases expressed CD68, CD11c, CD44, CD127, and
   PD-L1. However in CVID, reduced expression of the fibrosis-related
   protein fibronectin, but enrichment of CD163, CD3 and FAP alpha inside
   CVID granulomas was observed. Immunofluorescence analysis conformed a
   different cellular organization in CVID granulomas with increased influx
   of neutrophils, macrophages, T and B lymphocytes. In conclusion,
   granulomas in CVID display a different histological and cellular
   organization with increased influx of myeloid and lymphoid cells,
   compared to sarcoidosis, tuberculosis and pseudo-sarcoidosis, indicating
   a distinct pathogenesis underlying granuloma formation.

   science (IS) research in pediatric diabetes, report integration of IS
   theory and terminology, and offer guidance for future research.Recent
   FindingsOf 23 papers identified, 19 were published since 2017 and 21
   focused on type 1 diabetes. Most involved medical evidence-based
   practices (EBPs; n = 15), whereas fewer focused on psychosocial (n = 7)
   and diabetes education (n = 2). The majority either identified barriers
   and facilitators of implementing an EBP (n = 11) or were implementation
   trials (n = 11). Fewer studies documented gaps in EBP implementation in
   standard care (n = 7) or development of implementation strategies (n =
   1). Five papers employed IS theories and two aimed to improve
   equity.SummaryThere is a paucity of IS research in pediatric diabetes
   care literature. Few papers employed IS theory, used consistent IS
   terminology, or described IS strategies or outcomes. Guidance for future
   research to improve IS research in pediatric diabetes is offered.

AB Purpose of ReviewThe purpose of this review is to identify risks of
   neurosurgical procedures with emphasis on general medical and surgical
   complications in the post-operative setting. We specifically discuss
   complications related to craniotomy and craniectomy, open vascular and
   endovascular surgery, transsphenoidal surgery, cerebral spinal fluid
   flow diversion, and spinal surgery.Recent FindingsTechnological and
   scientific advances have allowed for increasing procedural applications
   with safer and less invasive techniques in the neurosurgical field.
   Ongoing research has focused on maximizing the benefits of these
   procedures by balancing the inherent associated risks. As such,
   post-operative complications have decreased, however their prevalence
   remains significant in several domains including infection, intracranial
   hemorrhage, seizures, cerebral edema, and
   hydrocephalus.SummaryNeurologists, and other clinicians who care for
   patients undergoing neurosurgery in the post-operative setting should be
   aware of the risks associated with these neurosurgical interventions,
   especially for patients who have undergone complex procedures, with the
   goal to better prevent, recognize and treat complications.

AB PurposeImmunodysregulation, Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, and
   X-linked syndrome (IPEX), caused by pathogenic FOXP3 variants, is a rare
   autoimmune disorder with diverse clinical features, including
   early-onset diabetes, eczema, and enteropathy. Atypical cases show
   milder symptoms and unique signs, requiring different treatments.
   Therefore, there are ambiguities in the accurate diagnosis and
   management of IPEX. We sought to present clinical, genetic, and
   immunological assessments of 12 IPEX patients with long-term follow-up
   to facilitate the diagnosis and management of the
   disease.MethodsClinical findings and treatment options of the patients
   were collected over time. Lymphocyte subpopulations, protein
   expressions, regulatory T (Treg) and circulating T follicular helper
   (cTFH) cells, and T-cell proliferation were analyzed.ResultsPredominant
   presentations included autoimmunity (91.6%), failure to thrive (66.7%),
   and eczema (58.3%). There were four classical and eight atypical IPEX
   individuals. Allergic manifestations were more common in atypical
   patients. Notably, chronic diarrhea demonstrated heightened severity
   compared to other manifestations. Four patients (33.3%) demonstrated
   eosinophilia, and nine (75%) showed high serum IgE levels. Most patients
   exhibited normal percentages of Treg cells with reduced CD25, FOXP3, and
   CTLA-4 expressions, corrected after hematopoietic stem cell
   transplantation (HSCT). Compared to healthy controls, the TH2-like
   skewing accompanied by reduced TH17-like responses was observed in cTFH
   and Treg cells of patients. Overall, nine patients (75%) received
   immunosuppressants (ISs), and six (50%) underwent HSCT, which was the
   only treatment revealing sustained control. Sirolimus was used in six
   patients and showed better control than other ISs.ConclusionsThe first
   cohort from Turkey with long-term follow-up results, comparing typical
   and atypical cases, provides insights into the outcomes of different
   therapeutic modalities and T- cell subtype changes in IPEX syndrome.

AB Background Talaromyces marneffei (T. marneffei) is an opportunistic
   pathogen that causes endemic mycoses, which could lead to multiple organ
   damage. Talaromycosis is frequently disregarded as an early cautionary
   sign of immune system disorders in non-HIV-infected children. Objective
   We conduct a comprehensive review of the genotypes and clinical features
   of talaromycosis in patients with IEI to enhance clinical awareness
   regarding T. marneffei as a potential opportunistic pathogen in
   individuals with immune deficiencies. Methods A systematic literature
   review was performed by searching PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of
   Controlled Trials, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Scopus. Data on IEI
   patients with talaromycosis, including genotypes and their immunological
   and clinical features, were collected. Results Fifty patients with
   talaromycosis and IEI were included: XHIM (30.0%), STAT3-LOF deficiency
   (20.0%), STAT1-GOF (20.0%), IL2RG (6.00%), IFNGR1 (6.0%), IL12RB1
   (4.0%), CARD9 (4.0%), COPA (4.0%), ADA (2.0%), RELB deficiency (2.0%),
   and NFKB2 (2.0%). Common symptoms of respiratory (43/50, 86.0%), skin
   (17/50, 34.0%), lymph node (31/50, 62.0%), digestive (34/50, 68.0%), and
   hematologic (22/50, 44.0%) systems were involved. The CT findings of the
   lungs may include lymph node calcification (9/30), interstitial lesions
   (8/30), pulmonary cavities (8/30), or specific pathogens (4/30), which
   could be easily misdiagnosed as tuberculosis infection. Amphotericin B
   (26/43), Voriconazole (24/43) and Itraconazole (22/43) were used for
   induction therapy. Ten patients were treated with Itraconazole
   sequentially and prophylaxis. 68.0% (34/50) of patients were still
   alive, and 4.0% (2/50) of were lost to follow-up. The disseminated T.
   marneffei infection resulted in the deaths of 14 individuals.
   Conclusions The XHIM, STAT1-GOF, and STAT3-LOF demonstrated the highest
   susceptibility to talaromycosis, indicating the potential involvement of
   cellular immunity, IL-17 signaling, and the IL-12/IFN-gamma axis in T.
   marneffei defense. T. marneffei infection may serve as an early warning
   indicator of IEI. For IEI patients suspected of T. marneffei,
   metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) could rapidly and
   effectively identify the causative pathogen. Prompt initiation of
   antifungal therapy is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes.

AB IntroductionThis study investigates the frequency of hospital
   attendances, emergency care attendances and geographical influences on
   service interaction in cohorts of patients with primary and secondary
   antibody deficiency, to inform future service planning and
   delivery.MethodsThe COVID-19 in Antibody Deficiency (COV-AD) study was a
   United Kingdom study that enrolled 525 participants between April 2021
   and September 2022. Data on health care utilisation was extracted from a
   screening cohort of participants at one participating site (Birmingham,
   UK). Hospital attendance (i.e. all outpatient and inpatient care
   episodes, including hospital-based IVIG treatment) and emergency care
   attendance patterns were analysed. Geographical differences in travel
   times to hospitals and associated costs were considered for all
   participants at all recruiting sites.ResultsIndividuals with antibody
   deficiency had a median of 7 hospital attendances per year. A diagnosis
   of secondary antibody deficiency, and antibody deficiency severe enough
   to require treatment with immunoglobulin replacement were associated
   with an increased frequency of hospital attendance. 12.7% of the cohort
   attended the Emergency Department at least once in the preceding twelve
   months. Individuals with secondary antibody deficiency were at greater
   risk of requiring emergency care over the preceding one-year and
   five-year periods. Individuals receiving subcutaneous immunoglobulin
   lived further from their local immunology centre and were more likely to
   engage with the COV-AD research study remotely, via dried blood spots
   sampling.ConclusionThis study highlights the utilisation of emergency
   and secondary care usage amongst patient with immunodeficiency and may
   inform service adaptation and development to better accommodate patient
   needs and circumstances.

   ICF syndrome. It has been reported that ICF syndrome is caused by
   mutations in the DNMT3B (ICF1), ZBTB24 (ICF2), CDCA7 (ICF3), and HELLS
   (ICF4) genes. As a result of literature research, there are no studies
   on transcription factor and cytokine expressions of helper T cell
   subsets in ICF syndrome. In the study; Th1 (TBET, STAT1, STAT4), Th2
   (GATA3, STAT6), Th17 (RORgt, STAT3), Treg (FoxP3, STAT5) transcription
   factors and the major cytokines of these cells (Th1; IFNG, Th2; IL4,
   Th17; IL17A-21-22, Treg; IL10, TGF beta) expressions were aimed to be
   evaluated by qRT-PCR. Patients (ICF3: three patients; ICF2: two
   patients), six heterozygous individual and five healthy controls were
   included in the study. All patients had hypogammaglobulinemia. Except
   for the CD19 cells of P2 from patients diagnosed with ICF3, the CD3,
   CD4, CD8, and CD19 cells in the other ICF3 patients were normal.
   However, the rates of these cells were low in patients with ICF2
   syndrome. Factors belonging to patients' Th1, Th17 and Treg cells were
   significantly lower than the control. Additionally, novel mutation was
   detected in ZBTB24 gene (c.1121-2 A > T). Our study is the first
   molecular study on Th cell subsets in patients with ICF syndrome and a
   new mutation that causes ICF2 syndrome has been identified.

AB BackgroundHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) carries a high
   mortality rate. Current existing risk-evaluation methodologies fall
   short and improved predictive methods are needed. This study aimed to
   forecast 30-day mortality in adult HLH patients using 11 distinct
   machine learning (ML) algorithms.MethodsA retrospective analysis on 431
   adult HLH patients from January 2015 to September 2021 was conducted.
   Feature selection was executed using the least absolute shrinkage and
   selection operator. We employed 11 ML algorithms to create prediction
   models. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity,
   positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F1 score,
   calibration curve and decision curve analysis were used to evaluate
   these models. We assessed feature importance using the SHapley Additive
   exPlanation (SHAP) approach.ResultsSeven independent predictors emerged
   as the most valuable features. An AUC between 0.65 and 1.00 was noted
   among the eleven ML algorithms. The gradient boosting decision tree
   (GBDT) algorithms demonstrated the most optimal performance (1.00 in the
   training cohort and 0.80 in the validation cohort). By employing the
   SHAP method, we identified the variables that contributed to the model
   and their correlation with 30-day mortality. The AUC of the GBDT
   algorithms was the highest when using the top 4 (ferritin, UREA, age and
   thrombin time (TT)) features, reaching 0.99 in the training cohort and
   0.83 in the validation cohort. Additionally, we developed a web-based
   calculator to estimate the risk of 30-day mortality.ConclusionsWith GBDT
   algorithms applied to laboratory data, accurate prediction of 30-day
   mortality is achievable. Integrating these algorithms into clinical
   practice could potentially improve 30-day outcomes.

AB High ferritin is an important and sensitive biomarker for the various
   forms of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a diverse and deadly
   group of cytokine storm syndromes. Early action to prevent
   immunopathology in HLH often includes empiric immunomodulation, which
   can complicate etiologic work-up and prevent collection of
   early/pre-treatment research samples. To address this, we instituted an
   alert system at UPMC Children's Hospital where serum ferritin > 1000
   ng/mL triggered real-time chart review, assessment of whether the value
   reflected "inflammatory hyperferritnemia (IHF)", and biobanking of
   remnant samples from consenting IHF patients. We extracted relevant
   clinical data; periodically measured serum total IL-18, IL-18 binding
   protein (IL-18BP), and CXCL9; retrospectively classified patients by
   etiology into infectious, rheumatic, or immune dysregulation; and
   subjected a subgroup of samples to a 96-analyte biomarker screen. 180
   patients were identified, 30.5% of which had IHF. Maximum ferritin
   levels were significantly higher in patients with IHF than with either
   hemoglobinopathy or transplant, and highly elevated total IL-18 levels
   were distinctive to patients with Stills Disease and/or Macrophage
   Activation Syndrome (MAS). Multi-analyte analysis showed elevation in
   proteins associated with cytotoxic lymphocytes in all IHF samples when
   compared to healthy controls and depression of proteins such as ANGPT1
   and VEGFR2 in samples from hyperferritinemic sepsis patients relative to
   non-sepsis controls. This real-time IFH screen proved feasible and
   efficient, validated prior observations about the specificity of IL-18,
   enabled early sample collection from a complex population, suggested a
   unique vascular biomarker signature in hyperferritinemic sepsis, and
   expanded our understanding of IHF heterogeneity.

AB Objective To analyze the lymphocyte subsets in individuals with Kabuki
   syndrome for better characterizing the immunological phenotype of this
   rare congenital disorder. Methods We characterized the immunological
   profile including B-, T- and natural killer-cell subsets in a series (N
   = 18) of individuals with Kabuki syndrome. Results All 18 individuals
   underwent genetic analysis: 15 had a variant in KMT2D and 3 a variant in
   KDM6A. Eleven of the 18 individuals (61%) had recurrent infections and 9
   (50%) respiratory infections. Three (17%) had autoimmune diseases. On
   immunological analysis, 6 (33%) had CD4 T-cell lymphopenia, which was
   preferentially associated with the KMT2D truncating variant (5/9
   individuals). Eight of 18 individuals (44%) had a humoral deficiency and
   eight (44%) had B lymphopenia. We found abnormal distributions of T-cell
   subsets, especially a frequent decrease in recent thymic emigrant CD4 +
   naive T-cell count in 13/16 individuals (81%). Conclusion The
   immunological features of Kabuki syndrome showed variable immune
   disorders with CD4 + T-cell deficiency in one third of cases, which had
   not been previously reported. In particular, we found a reduction in
   recent thymic emigrant na & iuml;ve CD4 + T-cell count in 13 of 16
   individuals, representing a novel finding that had not previously been
   reported.

AB Purpose Genetic hypomorphic defects in X chromosomal IKBKG coding for
   the NF-kappa B essential modulator (NEMO) lead to ectodermal dysplasia
   and immunodeficiency in males and the skin disorder incontinentia
   pigmenti (IP) in females, respectively. NF-kappa B essential modulator
   (NEMO) Delta-exon 5-autoinflammatory syndrome (NEMO-NDAS) is a systemic
   autoinflammatory disease caused by alternative splicing and increased
   proportion of NEMO-Delta ex5. We investigated a female carrier
   presenting with IP and NEMO-NDAS due to non-skewed X-inactivation.
   Methods IKBKG transcripts were quantified in peripheral blood
   mononuclear cells isolated from the patient, her mother, and healthy
   controls using RT-PCR and nanopore sequencing. Corresponding proteins
   were analyzed by western blotting and flow cytometry. Besides toll-like
   receptor (TLR) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, the interferon
   signature, cytokine production and X-inactivation status were
   investigated. Results IP and autoinflammation with recurrent fever, oral
   ulcers, hepatitis, and neutropenia, but no immunodeficiency was observed
   in a female patient. Besides moderately reduced NEMO signaling function,
   type I interferonopathy, and elevated IL-18 and CXCL10 were found. She
   and her mother both carried the heterozygous variant c.613 C > T
   p.(Gln205*) in exon 5 of IKBKG previously reported in NEMO-deficient
   patients. However, X-inactivation was skewed in the mother, but not in
   the patient. Alternative splicing led to increased ratios of NEMO-Dex5
   over full-length protein in peripheral blood cell subsets causing
   autoinflammation. Clinical symptoms partially resolved under treatment
   with TNF inhibitors. Conclusion Non-skewed X-inactivation can lead to
   NEMO-NDAS in females with IP carrying hypomorphic IKBKG variants due to
   alternative splicing and increased proportions of NEMO-triangle ex5.

AB Natural antibodies (NAbs) occurring in individuals without prior
   exposure to specific antigens, provide direct first barrier protection
   against pathogens, and exert immunoregulation thus actively contributing
   to the maintenance of immune homeostasis, controlling inflammatory
   processes and preventing autoimmunity. Common variable immunodeficiency
   (CVID) is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by a
   compromised immune function that brings into focus the role of NAbs. Our
   aim was to explore whether NAb levels could serve as potential key
   indicators in CVID for monitoring disease progression and predicting
   outcomes. In this study, we analyzed a Hellenic cohort of 56 patients
   with CVID (31 newly diagnosed and 25 under immunoglobulin replacement
   therapy-IgRT) and 33 healthy controls, for total Ig levels and serum IgM
   and IgG NAb levels against five informative target-antigens of NAbs,
   namely, actin, DNA, carbonic anhydrase, F(ab')2 fragments of human IgG
   and TriNitroPhenyl. In addition, follow-up pre- and post- IgRT samples
   were analyzed in ten (10) patients of our cohort. Results showed that
   Ig-treated patients exhibited significantly lower IgM NAb levels than
   untreated patients and healthy controls against all panel antigens. In
   the follow-up samples, pre-treatment IgM NAb levels negatively
   correlated with total serum IgM. This imbalance was only partially
   restored after IgRT, with a significant decrease in IgM NAb levels
   observed in nine out of ten patients. Moreover, post-treatment patients
   with recurrent infections presented significantly lower IgM NAb levels,
   a reduction also observed in patients with bronchiectasis independently
   of treatment status. On the contrary, post-treatment patients with
   enteropathy had significantly higher IgM NAb levels against all panel
   antigens, an increase also noted in patients with autoimmune diseases.
   Regarding IgG NAbs, replacement therapy restored levels to those of
   healthy controls. In conclusion, impaired NAb levels are found in CVID
   patients, particularly related to certain phenotypes. Moreover, the
   significant decrease in IgM NAb levels after IgRT suggests a potential
   association with disease course and complications. The results suggest
   that administration of human IgM NAbs may be an effective combinatorial
   treatment in selected patients. Further research is needed to understand
   the functional roles of NAbs in CVID and its complex clinical
   phenotypes.

AB LRBA deficiency is an inborn error of immunity defined by autoimmunity,
   lymphoproliferation, recurrent infections, cytopenia, and inflammatory
   bowel disease. Despite recent advances in managing this disease with
   targeted biologic therapy, haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
   remains the only cure. However, great variability exists between
   protocols used to transplant patients with LRBA deficiency. We describe
   a cohort of seven patients with LRBA deficiency who underwent HSCT using
   a myeloablative, reduced toxicity regime of fludarabine, treosulfan, and
   thiotepa at two transplantation centres from 2016 to 2019. Data were
   collected both retrospectively and prospectively, measuring time to
   engraftment, infectious complications, incidence of graft versus host
   disease, and post-transplantation chimerism. Six of seven patients
   survived transplantation, and four of six surviving patients achieving
   treatment-free survival. We thus recommend that HSCT with fludarabine,
   treosulfan, and thiotepa-based conditioning be considered in patients
   with LRBA deficiency.

AB Background IL10RA (IL10 receptor subunit alpha) deficiency is an
   autosomal recessive disease that causes inflammatory bowel disease
   during early infancy. Its clinical course is often fatal and the only
   curative treatment is allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
   (HCT). In Japan, only case reports are available, and there are no
   comprehensive reports of treatment outcomes. Methods We retrospectively
   analyzed patients with IL10RA deficiency in Japan. Results Two newly
   identified and five previously reported patients were included in this
   study. Five patients underwent HCT; one untransplanted patient survived
   to age 14, and one died of influenza encephalopathy before
   transplantation. All five HCT recipients underwent HCT at the age before
   2 years. They all were conditioned with fludarabine/busulfan- or
   fludarabine /melphalan-based regimens. The donor source was human
   leukocyte antigen haploidentical donor bone marrow (BM) for two patients
   and unrelated umbilical cord blood (CB) for two patients. One patient
   experienced graft failure with unrelated CB and required a second
   transplant with unrelated BM. All patients who underwent HCT survived
   and demonstrated an improved performance status. Conclusion In cases of
   IL10RA deficiency, the need for transplantation should be promptly
   assessed, and early transplantation should be considered. (190/250)

AB Purpose of ReviewThis literature review is intended to highlight recent
   correlations between urologic, heart and overall health by emphasizing
   healthy eating patterns, physical activity, alcohol minimization and
   tobacco elimination, healthy sleep, weight, cholesterol, blood sugar,
   blood pressure management, and mental health awareness.Recent
   FindingsMeta-analyses, systematic reviews, and clinical studies espouse
   a unified message for prevention, reducing the risk of disease
   recurrence, progression, complementing conventional medical intervention
   efficacy, and mitigating treatment side effects. Limiting or eliminating
   alcohol consumption could be considered an independent recommendation
   and adding a mental health and miscellaneous (genetic risk and
   lifestyle, planetary health, HPV or other vaccination awareness,
   spirituality, etc.) category could allow for individualized educational
   opportunities, synergism appreciation, and
   self-improvement.SummaryUrologic healthcare professionals have the
   potential to strengthen the collective public health goal of improving
   the quality and quantity of the lives of patients able to adhere to
   these heart healthy recommendations.

AB Purpose of ReviewBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is prevalent in
   nearly 70% of men over the age of 60, leading to significant clinical
   challenges due to varying symptom presentations and treatment responses.
   The decision to undergo surgical intervention is not straightforward;
   the American Urological Association recommends consideration of surgical
   treatment after inadequate or failed response to medical therapy. This
   review explores the role of artificial intelligence (AI), including
   machine learning and deep learning models, in enhancing the
   decision-making processes for BPH management.Recent FindingsAI
   applications in this space include analysis of non-invasive imaging
   modalities, such as multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and
   Ultrasound, which enhance diagnostic precision. AI models also
   concatenate serum biomarkers and histopathological analysis to
   distinguish BPH from prostate cancer (PC), offering high accuracy rates.
   Furthermore, AI aids in predicting patient outcomes post-treatment,
   supporting personalized medicine, and optimizing therapeutic
   strategies.SummaryAI has demonstrated potential in differentiating BPH
   from PC through advanced imaging and predictive models, improving
   diagnostic accuracy, and reducing the need for invasive procedures.
   Despite promising advancements, challenges remain in integrating AI into
   clinical workflows, establishing standard evaluation metrics, and
   achieving cost-effectiveness. Here, we underscore the potential of AI to
   improve patient outcomes, streamline BPH management, and reduce
   healthcare costs, especially with continued research and development in
   this transformative field.

AB Neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease and other
   dementias as well as Parkinson's disease, are emerging as profoundly
   significant challenges and burdens to global health, a trend highlighted
   by the most recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 studies. This
   growing impact is closely linked to the demographic shift toward an
   aging population and the potential long-term repercussions of the
   COVID-19 pandemic, both of which have intensified the prevalence and
   severity of these conditions. In this review, we explore several
   critical aspects of this complex issue, including the increasing global
   burden of neurodegenerative diseases, unmet medical and social needs
   within current care systems, the unique and amplified challenges posed
   by the COVID-19 pandemic, and potential strategies for enhancing
   healthcare policy and practice. We underscore the urgent need for
   cohesive, multidisciplinary approaches across medical, research, and
   policy domains to effectively address the increasing burden of
   neurodegenerative diseases, thereby improving the quality of life for
   patients and their caregivers.

AB The relationship between key energy metabolites and brain health is not
   well understood. We investigated the association between circulating
   ketone bodies, pyruvate, and citrate with cognitive decline, structural
   brain characteristics, and risk of dementia. We measured ketone bodies
   (acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone), pyruvate, and citrate
   species using NMR in plasma samples from 1,850 older adults in the
   Cardiovascular Health Study collected in 1989-90 or 1992-93. Cognitive
   decline was assessed using the modified Mini-Mental State Examination
   and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Dementia was adjudicated by a
   committee of experts through comprehensive evaluations including
   cognitive tests, medical records, and interviews with the next of kin.
   Dementiarelated mortality was confirmed by a committee using death
   certificates and other clinical data from hospitalization. Multivariable
   linear mixed models were used to assess 9-year cognitive decline, while
   multivariable Cox regression models evaluated 6-year dementia incidence
   and 22-year dementia-related mortality. White matter lesions and
   ventricular size were measured using MRI in 1992-94 and were analyzed
   using multivariable linear regression models. Higher plasma levels of
   ketones, particularly beta-hydroxybutyrate, were associated with faster
   cognitive decline (beta,0.10; 95% CI,-0.15 to-0.05; P-adj<.001) and
   dementia-related mortality (HR per SD, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.56;
   P-adj=0.023). Higher pyruvate concentrations were associated with slower
   cognitive decline, smaller ventricular size, lower dementia risk (HR per
   SD, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.97; P=0.013; P-adj=0.073), and lower
   dementia mortality. Higher citrate levels were associated with less
   cognitive decline and lower dementia risk. In adults aged 65 years and
   older, circulating ketone bodies are associated with faster cognitive
   decline and higher dementia mortality, while pyruvate and citrate are
   associated with lower dementia risk.

AB Background: The implementation of electronic referral systems in
   healthcare has streamlined communication between referrers and
   specialists, improving efficiency and documentation. Such systems can
   optimise patient care and reduce the burden on medical staff. This study
   reports on the development, implementation, and evaluation of the
   "Hospital Emergency Neurosurgical Referral Interface" (HENRI), a bespoke
   web-based referral system introduced at the Royal Brisbane and Women's
   Hospital (RBWH). Methods: HENRI was developed by integrating with
   existing hospital systems for patient data retrieval. It was gradually
   implemented, and mandatory use was introduced in 2021. Surveys were
   conducted before and after HENRI's implementation to assess user
   satisfaction. Phone call volumes to neurosurgical registrars were
   compared pre-HENRI and post-HENRI. Results: In its first year of use,
   HENRI handled 3971 referrals for 3065 patients from 1369 referrers at 37
   hospitals. The mean time to decision was 1 h and 41 min. A survey
   post-implementation revealed improved user satisfaction with the
   referral process, despite concerns about response times and loss of
   nuanced communication. Phone call analysis showed a 35 % reduction in
   calls to neurosurgical registrars post-HENRI implementation (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: HENRI has improved documentation, communication, and the
   efficiency of neurosurgical referrals at RBWH. The reduction in phone
   calls and streamlined processes have relieved pressure on on-call staff
   and improved overall patient care. Despite some challenges, including
   delays in response times and the need for ongoing system refinement,
   HENRI has proven to be a valuable tool in enhancing neurosurgical
   referral processes. Future improvements could further optimize its
   functionality and user experience.

AB Investigating the dynamic response of human tympanic membranes (TMs)
   exposed to blasts requires full-field-of-view and three-dimensional (3D)
   methodologies. Our paper introduces a system that combines high-speed 3D
   digital image correlation (HS 3D-DIC) and Schlieren imaging (HS-SI) with
   a custom-designed shock tube for generating blast waves. This integrated
   system allows us to measure TM surface motions under intense transient
   loading, capturing full-field-of-view shape deformations exceeding
   100mum with a temporal resolution of 10 mus. System characterization
   encompasses (i) measuring the shock tube's output levels and
   repeatability, (ii) assessment of the spatial and temporal resolutions
   of the imaging techniques, and (iii) identification of overall system
   limitations. Optimizing these factors is crucial for improving the
   reliability of our system to ensure the accurate measurement of
   deformations. To assess our shock tube's reliability in generating
   repeated blast waves, we instrumented it with high-pressure (HP) and
   high-frequency (HF) pressure sensors along the blast wave pathway to
   record overpressure waveforms and compared them with Schlieren imaging
   visualized blast waves. We validate our HS 3D-DIC measured deformations
   by comparing them with deformations measured using single-point laser
   Doppler vibrometry (LDV), establishing a comprehensive assessment of the
   TM's dynamic response and potential fracture mechanics under blast.
   Finally, we test our approach with 3D-printed TM-like samples and a real
   cadaveric human TM. This methodology lays the groundwork for further
   investigations of blast-related auditory damage and the invention of
   more effective protective and medical solutions.

AB The aim of my research is to theoretically develop and then
   computationally implement methods for predicting the behavior of
   fundamental particles. I achieve this primarily by extending the reach
   of a method called lattice field theory. Lattice field theory is a
   specific way of defining a quantum field theory that is well-suited to
   numerical computations using high performance computing. Quantum field
   theory, in turn, is a flexible framework for the mathematical
   description of a wide range of physical systems. This includes a
   particular quantum field theory, known as the Standard Model, which is
   an overwhelmingly successful description of all particles and forces
   ever discovered.  By applying numerical lattice field theory to the
   Standard Model, it is possible to provide pre- and post-dictions for
   experiments being performed worldwide. This includes experiments at the
   Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, such as the LHCb experiment, which
   recently measured the violation of a fundamental symmetry (the symmetry
   of mirroring particles and flipping their electric charges). My research
   will open the door to understanding whether this symmetry violation is
   hidden within the Standard Model, or is evidence for new particles and
   forces yet to be discovered. Similar methods can be used to explore many
   other results from LHCb and other experiments, such as Belle II at the
   SuperKEKB accelerator in Japan, which is dedicated to measuring
   parameters relevant to the weak force, a part of the Standard Model
   expected to be particularly important in the hunt for new particles and
   forces.  In addition to exploring the quantum field theory of the
   Standard Model, it is possible to define alternative quantum field
   theories with exotic and interesting properties that could describe
   observations that we know do not fit the otherwise very successful
   Standard Model paradigm. An impressive example in this category is dark
   matter, a material that is gravitationally observed to fill the known
   universe, but whose nature and properties otherwise remain mysterious.
   Experiments such as LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ), XENON, and PandaX are dedicated to
   the direct detection of dark matter particles. I am collaborating on
   lattice field theory calculations that will be useful both for
   interpreting the results when these experiments are successful, and for
   understanding the constraints that arise from non-detection with
   increasing sensitivity.  In addition, because numerical lattice field
   theory makes use of advanced numerical data analysis techniques, it
   benefits from and contributes to an interplay with other numerical
   fields. This also plays an important role in my own work. An example of
   this is a technique known as the Backus-Gilbert method. Originally
   developed for geophysics, this is an algorithm for solving so-called
   inverse problems, in which observed effects are used to infer underlying
   causes. In lattice field theory, it can be used to extract predictions
   for processes involving high-energy collisions that produce many
   particles. The specific methods I have worked on to extend the reach of
   this approach have potential applications beyond particle physics, for
   example in areas such as medical imaging for image reconstruction, and
   in environmental science for interpretation of seismic data.  In
   summary, my research makes it possible to predict and understand the
   behaviour fundamental particles, explores the Standard Model and
   theories beyond, and uncovers synergies across different branches of
   computational science and data analysis.

AB Probabilistic models are a mathematical representation of a given data
   set in terms of a  probability distribution. The probability
   distribution reveals information about the  frequency and correlation of
   features in the data set. The nuanced probabilistic  representation can
   subsequently be used in numerous downstream tasks such as the 
   generation of realistic synthetic data points, the classification of
   data, or the improvement  of medical imaging methods. Deep neural
   networks, on the other hand, have significantly advanced the field of 
   machine learning. They allow computers to read hand-written notes, make
   predictions in  complex scenarios, or translate between languages.
   However, such networks are typically  not well-suited for learning
   probabilistic models because the output of neural networks  can not be
   interpreted as a probability. This has led to the development of
   unnormalised  models which allow the modelling via a deep neural
   network. However, training  unnormalised models is difficult, and most
   methods are not well-grounded in theoretical  works. Theoretical
   guarantees, however, are critical when applying the obtained 
   probabilistic representation in sensitive areas such as medicine. My
   research focuses on new methodologies for the training and evaluation of
   deep  unnormalised probabilistic models. The aim of my research is
   two-fold. Firstly, I work  towards training methodologies that are
   derived from classical theoretical results in  statistics and
   probability theory. Such methods perform more reliably, and failure
   cases  that appear in conventionally used algorithms can be ruled out.
   Furthermore,  approximation errors remain tractable so that one can
   prove theoretical guarantees  missing in related works. Secondly, I aim
   to achieve competitive performance with  previous training methods for
   unnormalised models. In particular, I seek to make our  methodology
   scalable to high-dimensional data without compromising the quality of
   the  learned distribution. In our current numerical experiments, we
   observe that our method  captures non-linear dependencies in the data
   and generalises well when used to generate  synthetic data samples.
   Since probabilistic models represent our knowledge about a system
   obtained from data,  my work is universally applicable in big-data
   settings. They are most known for their  capacity to generate realistic
   artificial images or to fill incomplete images. Probabilistic  models
   are also impactful in engineering applications where the quantity of
   interest has to  be inferred from values of a known forward process
   (so-called Bayesian inverse  problems). A prominent example of this is
   the reconstruction of a medical image from  measurements of scattered
   radiation. Additionally, probabilistic models can be used to  conceal
   sensitive or private information in data sets because they contain
   relevant  statistical information rather than individual data points.
   Hence, the probabilistic model  can be used to optimise processes while
   not revealing sensitive information such as  patient data in hospitals.

AB Objective: To analyze the relationship between extent, severity, and
   rate of progression of periodontitis with the implant outcome. Methods:
   Dental records of adult patients who had attended the dental clinics of
   the universities contributing data to the BigMouth network between 2011
   and 2022 seeking implant therapy were evaluated. Patients' records were
   furthered examined for a periodontal diagnosis based on the 2017 World
   Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases
   and Conditions. Patients were further categorized based on extent
   (generalized/localized), severity (stage I, II, III, IV), and rate of
   progression (grade A, B, C). Information including demographic
   characteristics, self-reported medical conditions, as well as the number
   of missing teeth were extracted from patients' electronic health
   records. Results: Records of 50,312 dental implants placed in 20,842
   patients over a 12-year period were screened. Three hundred twenty-two
   records of implants were placed in patients with a recorded
   periodontitis diagnosis based on the 2017 periodontal classification.
   The mean age of the cohort was 57.53 12.95 years which consisted of 52.2
   % males, 74.2 % non-Hispanic, 55.9 % white individuals, 9 % diabetics,
   3.4 % tobacco users. The univariate analysis demonstrated that
   periodontitis extent, severity, and rate of progression were not
   significantly associated with the treatment outcome. The implant failure
   rate was estimated to be 5.6 %. Conclusions: Within the limitations of
   this retrospective study that utilized records of dental implants placed
   in institutions in the United States contributing data to the BigMouth
   network, the implant failure rate was estimated to be 5.6 %.
   Periodontitis extent, severity, and rate of progression were not
   significantly associated with the implant treatment outcome. (c) 2024

AB Abnormal widening of the mandibular canal (MC) is rarely observed on
   radiography. Nonetheless, as most of the current research on abnormal
   mandibular widening is limited to case reports and MCs have relatively
   deep and hidden positions, there are challenges in diagnosing and
   formulating treatment plans for patients with abnormal MC widening. To
   provide ideas for the differential diagnosis and treatment choices of
   the characteristic clinical sign, this study included patients with
   abnormal widening of the MC between July 2014 and October 2023. The
   patient's medical records were reviewed, general information, disease
   details and radiographic features (panoramic reconstructive computed
   tomography) of MC widening were collected. Patients were followed up to
   assess treatment outcomes. In conclusion, the abnormal widening of the
   MC often implies a pathological state of the mandible. And different
   morphologies of the widened MC are helpful for differential diagnosis of
   protential mandibular disease. (c) 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

AB Acute central nervous system injuries, including ischemic stroke,
   intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain
   injury, and spinal cord injury, are a major global health challenge.
   Identifying optimal therapies and improving the long-term neurological
   functions of patients with acute central nervous system injuries are
   urgent priorities. Mitochondria are susceptible to damage after acute
   central nervous system injury, and this leads to the release of toxic
   levels of reactive oxygen species, which induce cell death. Mitophagy, a
   selective form of autophagy, is crucial in eliminating redundant or
   damaged mitochondria during these events. Recent evidence has
   highlighted the significant role of mitophagy in acute central nervous
   system injuries. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of
   the process, classification, and related mechanisms of mitophagy. We
   also highlight the recent developments in research into the role of
   mitophagy in various acute central nervous system injuries and drug
   therapies that regulate mitophagy. In the final section of this review,
   we emphasize the potential for treating these disorders by focusing on
   mitophagy and suggest future research paths in this area.

AB The involvement of the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate in
   cerebral ischemia and excitotoxicity is well-documented. Nevertheless,
   the role of non-excitatory amino acids in brain damage following a
   stroke or brain trauma remains largely understudied. The release of
   amino acids by necrotic cells in the ischemic core may contribute to the
   expansion of the penumbra. Our findings indicated that the reversible
   loss of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials caused by transient
   hypoxia became irreversible when exposed to a mixture of just four
   non-excitatory amino acids (L-alanine, glycine, L-glutamine, and
   L-serine) at their plasma concentrations. These amino acids induce
   swelling in the somas of neurons and astrocytes during hypoxia, along
   with permanent dendritic damage mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptors. Blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors prevented neuronal
   damage in the presence of these amino acids during hypoxia. It is likely
   that astroglial swelling caused by the accumulation of these amino acids
   via the alanine-serine-cysteine transporter 2 exchanger and system N
   transporters activates volume-regulated anion channels, leading to the
   release of excitotoxins and subsequent neuronal damage through
   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation. Thus, previously unrecognized
   mechanisms involving non-excitatory amino acids may contribute to the
   progression and expansion of brain injury in neurological emergencies
   such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. Understanding these pathways
   could highlight new therapeutic targets to mitigate brain injury.

AB Olfactory receptors are crucial for detecting odors and play a vital
   role in our sense of smell, influencing behaviors from food choices to
   emotional memories. These receptors also contribute to our perception of
   flavor and have potential applications in medical diagnostics and
   environmental monitoring. The ability of the olfactory system to
   regenerate its sensory neurons provides a unique model to study neural
   regeneration, a phenomenon largely absent in the central nervous system.
   Insights gained from how olfactory neurons continuously replace
   themselves and reestablish functional connections can provide strategies
   to promote similar regenerative processes in the central nervous system,
   where damage often results in permanent deficits. Understanding the
   molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning olfactory neuron
   regeneration could pave the way for developing therapeutic approaches to
   treat spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative diseases like
   Alzheimer's disease. Olfactory receptors are found in almost any cell of
   every organ/tissue of the mammalian body. This ectopic expression
   provides insights into the chemical structures that can activate
   olfactory receptors. In addition to odors, olfactory receptors in
   ectopic expression may respond to endogenous compounds and molecules
   produced by mucosal colonizing microbiota. The analysis of the function
   of olfactory receptors in ectopic expression provides valuable
   information on the signaling pathway engaged upon receptor activation
   and the receptor's role in proliferation and cell differentiation
   mechanisms. This review explores the ectopic expression of olfactory
   receptors and the role they may play in neural regeneration within the
   central nervous system, with particular attention to compounds that can
   activate these receptors to initiate regenerative processes. Evidence
   suggests that olfactory receptors could serve as potential therapeutic
   targets for enhancing neural repair and recovery following central
   nervous system injuries.

AB Alzheimer's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder in older
   adults. Despite its prevalence, its pathogenesis remains unclear. In
   addition to the most widely accepted causes, which include excessive
   amyloid-beta aggregation, tau hyperphosphorylation, and deficiency of
   the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, numerous studies have shown that the
   dopaminergic system is also closely associated with the occurrence and
   development of this condition. Dopamine is a crucial catecholaminergic
   neurotransmitter in the human body. Dopamine-associated treatments, such
   as drugs that target dopamine receptor D and dopamine analogs, can
   improve cognitive function and alleviate psychiatric symptoms as well as
   ameliorate other clinical manifestations. However, therapeutics
   targeting the dopaminergic system are associated with various adverse
   reactions, such as addiction and exacerbation of cognitive impairment.
   This review summarizes the role of the dopaminergic system in the
   pathology of Alzheimer's disease, focusing on currently available
   dopamine-based therapies for this disorder and the common side effects
   associated with dopamine-related drugs. The aim of this review is to
   provide insights into the potential connections between the dopaminergic
   system and Alzheimer's disease, thus helping to clarify the mechanisms
   underlying the condition and exploring more effective therapeutic
   options.

AB Hearing loss is the third leading cause of human disability. Age-related
   hearing loss, one type of acquired sensorineural hearing loss, is
   largely responsible for this escalating global health burden.
   Noise-induced, ototoxic, and idiopathic sudden sensorineural are other
   less common types of acquired hearing loss. The etiology of these
   conditions is complex and multi-factorial involving an interplay of
   genetic and environmental factors. Oxidative stress has recently been
   proposed as a likely linking cause in most types of acquired
   sensorineural hearing loss. Short non-coding RNA sequences known as
   microRNAs (miRNAs) have increasingly been shown to play a role in
   cellular hypoxia and oxidative stress responses including promoting an
   apoptotic response. Sensory hair cell death is a central
   histopathological finding in sensorineural hearing loss. As these cells
   do not regenerate in humans, it underlies the irreversibility of human
   age-related hearing loss. Ovid EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science Core
   Collection, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases over the period August 1,
   2018 to July 31, 2023 were searched with "hearing loss," "hypoxamiRs,"
   "hypoxia," "microRNAs," "ischemia," and "oxidative stress" text words
   for English language primary study publications or registered clinical
   trials. Registered clinical trials known to the senior author were also
   assessed. A total of 222 studies were thus identified. After excluding
   duplicates, editorials, retractions, secondary research studies, and
   non-English language articles, 39 primary studies and clinical trials
   underwent full-text screening. This resulted in 11 animal, in vitro,
   and/or human subject journal articles and 8 registered clinical trial
   database entries which form the basis of this narrative review. MiRNAs
   miR-34a and miR-29b levels increase with age in mice. These miRNAs were
   demonstrated in human neuroblastoma and murine cochlear cell lines to
   target Sirtuin 1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
   coactivator-1-alpha (SIRT1/PGC-1 alpha), SIRT1/p53, and
   SIRT1/hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha signaling pathways resulting in
   increased apoptosis. Furthermore, hypoxia and oxidative stress had a
   similar adverse apoptotic effect, which was inhibited by resveratrol and
   a myocardial inhibitor-associated transcript, a miR-29b competing
   endogenous mRNA. Gentamicin reduced miR-182-5p levels and increased
   cochlear oxidative stress and cell death in mice - an effect that was
   corrected by inner ear stem cell-derived exosomes. There is ongoing work
   seeking to determine if these findings can be effectively translated to
   humans.

AB The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulates the secretion of
   glucocorticoids in response to environmental challenges. In the brain, a
   nuclear receptor transcription factor, the glucocorticoid receptor, is
   an important component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis's
   negative feedback loop and plays a key role in regulating cognitive
   equilibrium and neuroplasticity. The glucocorticoid receptor influences
   cognitive processes, including glutamate neurotransmission, calcium
   signaling, and the activation of brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor-mediated pathways, through a combination of genomic and
   non-genomic mechanisms. Protein interactions within the central nervous
   system can alter the expression and activity of the glucocorticoid
   receptor, thereby affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and
   stress-related cognitive functions. An appropriate level of
   glucocorticoid receptor expression can improve cognitive function, while
   excessive glucocorticoid receptors or long-term exposure to
   glucocorticoids may lead to cognitive impairment. Patients with
   cognitive impairment-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease,
   aging, depression, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, stroke,
   and addiction, often present with dysregulation of the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and glucocorticoid receptor
   expression. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the
   functions of the glucocorticoid receptor in the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and cognitive activities. It
   emphasizes that appropriate glucocorticoid receptor signaling
   facilitates learning and memory, while its dysregulation can lead to
   cognitive impairment. This provides clues about how glucocorticoid
   receptor signaling can be targeted to overcome cognitive
   disability-related disorders.

AB Traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease share pathological
   similarities, including neuronal loss, amyloid-beta deposition, tau
   hyperphosphorylation, blood-brain barrier dysfunction,
   neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, traumatic brain
   injury can exacerbate Alzheimer's disease-like pathologies, potentially
   leading to the development of Alzheimer's disease. Nanocarriers offer a
   potential solution by facilitating the delivery of small interfering
   RNAs across the blood-brain barrier for the targeted silencing of key
   pathological genes implicated in traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's
   disease. Unlike traditional approaches to neuroregeneration, this is a
   molecular-targeted strategy, thus avoiding non-specific drug actions.
   This review focuses on the use of nanocarrier systems for the efficient
   and precise delivery of siRNAs, discussing the advantages, challenges,
   and future directions. In principle, siRNAs have the potential to target
   all genes and non-targetable proteins, holding significant promise for
   treating various diseases. Among the various therapeutic approaches
   currently available for neurological diseases, siRNA gene silencing can
   precisely "turn off" the expression of any gene at the genetic level,
   thus radically inhibiting disease progression; however, a significant
   challenge lies in delivering siRNAs across the blood-brain barrier.
   Nanoparticles have received increasing attention as an innovative drug
   delivery tool for the treatment of brain diseases. They are considered a
   potential therapeutic strategy with the advantages of being able to
   cross the blood-brain barrier, targeted drug delivery, enhanced drug
   stability, and multifunctional therapy. The use of nanoparticles to
   deliver specific modified siRNAs to the injured brain is gradually being
   recognized as a feasible and effective approach. Although this strategy
   is still in the preclinical exploration stage, it is expected to achieve
   clinical translation in the future, creating a new field of molecular
   targeted therapy and precision medicine for the treatment of Alzheimer's
   disease associated with traumatic brain injury.

AB Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating neurodegenerative disease
   for which the current treatment approaches remain severely limited. The
   principal pathological alterations of the disease include the selective
   degeneration of motor neurons in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord,
   as well as abnormal protein deposition in the cytoplasm of neurons and
   glial cells. The biological markers under extensive scrutiny are
   predominantly located in the cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and even urine.
   Among these biomarkers, neurofilament proteins and glial fibrillary
   acidic protein most accurately reflect the pathologic changes in the
   central nervous system, while creatinine and creatine kinase mainly
   indicate pathological alterations in the peripheral nerves and muscles.
   Neurofilament light chain levels serve as an indicator of neuronal
   axonal injury that remain stable throughout disease progression and are
   a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker with high specificity
   and sensitivity. However, there are challenges in using neurofilament
   light chain to differentiate amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from other
   central nervous system diseases with axonal injury. Glial fibrillary
   acidic protein predominantly reflects the degree of neuronal
   demyelination and is linked to non-motor symptoms of amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis such as cognitive impairment, oxygen saturation, and the
   glomerular filtration rate. TAR DNA-binding protein 43, a pathological
   protein associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is emerging as a
   promising biomarker, particularly with advancements in exosome-related
   research. Evidence is currently lacking for the value of creatinine and
   creatine kinase as diagnostic markers; however, they show potential in
   predicting disease prognosis. Despite the vigorous progress made in the
   identification of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis biomarkers in recent
   years, the quest for definitive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
   remains a formidable challenge. This review summarizes the latest
   research achievements concerning blood biomarkers in amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis that can provide a more direct basis for the differential
   diagnosis and prognostic assessment of the disease beyond a reliance on
   clinical manifestations and electromyography findings.

AB Poststroke cognitive impairment is a major secondary effect of ischemic
   stroke in many patients; however, few options are available for the
   early diagnosis and treatment of this condition. The aims of this study
   were to (1) determine the specific relationship between hypoxic and
   alpha-synuclein during the occur of poststroke cognitive impairment and
   (2) assess whether the serum phosphorylated alpha-synuclein level can be
   used as a biomarker for poststroke cognitive impairment. We found that
   the phosphorylated alpha-synuclein level was significantly increased and
   showed pathological aggregation around the cerebral infarct area in a
   mouse model of ischemic stroke. In addition, neuronal alpha-synuclein
   phosphorylation and aggregation were observed in the brain tissue of
   mice subjected to chronic hypoxia, suggesting that hypoxia is the
   underlying cause of alpha-synuclein-mediated pathology in the brains of
   mice with ischemic stroke. Serum phosphorylated alpha-synuclein levels
   in patients with ischemic stroke were significantly lower than those in
   healthy subjects, and were positively correlated with cognition levels
   in patients with ischemic stroke. Furthermore, a decrease in serum
   high-density lipoprotein levels in stroke patients was significantly
   correlated with a decrease in phosphorylated alpha-synuclein levels.
   Although ischemic stroke mice did not show significant cognitive
   impairment or disrupted lipid metabolism 14 days after injury, some of
   them exhibited decreased cognitive function and reduced phosphorylated
   alpha-synuclein levels. Taken together, our results suggest that serum
   phosphorylated alpha-synuclein is a potential biomarker for poststroke
   cognitive impairment.

AB Although microglial polarization and neuroinflammation are crucial
   cellular responses after traumatic brain injury, the fundamental
   regulatory and functional mechanisms remain insufficiently understood.
   As potent anti-inflammatory agents, the use of glucocorticoids in
   traumatic brain injury is still controversial, and their regulatory
   effects on microglial polarization are not yet known. In the present
   study, we sought to determine whether exacerbation of traumatic brain
   injury caused by high-dose dexamethasone is related to its regulatory
   effects on microglial polarization and its mechanisms of action. In
   vitro cultured BV2 cells and primary microglia and a controlled cortical
   impact mouse model were used to investigate the effects of dexamethasone
   on microglial polarization. Lipopolysaccharide, dexamethasone, RU486 (a
   glucocorticoid receptor antagonist), and ruxolitinib (a Janus kinase 1
   antagonist) were administered. RNA-sequencing data obtained from a
   C57BL/6 mouse model of traumatic brain injury were used to identify
   potential targets of dexamethasone. The Morris water maze, quantitative
   reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting,
   immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analysis, and TUNEL, Nissl,
   and Golgi staining were performed to investigate our hypothesis.
   High-throughput sequencing results showed that arginase 1, a marker of
   M2 microglia, was significantly downregulated in the dexamethasone group
   compared with the traumatic brain injury group at 3 days post-traumatic
   brain injury. Thus dexamethasone inhibited M1 and M2 microglia, with a
   more pronounced inhibitory effect on M2 microglia in vitro and in vivo.
   Glucocorticoid receptor plays an indispensable role in microglial
   polarization after dexamethasone treatment following traumatic brain
   injury. Additionally, glucocorticoid receptor activation increased the
   number of apoptotic cells and neuronal death, and also decreased the
   density of dendritic spines. A possible downstream receptor signaling
   mechanism is the GR/JAK1/STAT3 pathway. Overactivation of glucocorticoid
   receptor by high-dose dexamethasone reduced the expression of M2
   microglia, which plays an anti-inflammatory role. In contrast,
   inhibiting the activation of glucocorticoid receptor reduced the number
   of apoptotic glia and neurons and decreased the loss of dendritic spines
   after traumatic brain injury. Dexamethasone may exert its neurotoxic
   effects by inhibiting M2 microglia through the GR/JAK1/STAT3 signaling
   pathway.

   Regarding "benefits for the person", the results reveal that employees
   have knowledge of real performance in their work, this encourages
   introspective reflection, thus obtaining a clear vision of their
   strengths and areas for improvement; Regarding "benefits for the
   organization," performance evaluation allows the sustainable growth of
   the organization to be aligned with existing needs, establishing
   strategies that improve its performance in order to guarantee adequate
   decision-making for its development. It is concluded that the

AB Ischemic stroke represents a significant global health challenge, often
   resulting in death or long-term disability, particularly among the
   elderly, where advancing age stands as the most unmodifiable risk
   factor. Arising from the blockage of a brain-feeding artery, the only
   therapies available to date aim at removing the blood clot to restore
   cerebral blood flow and rescue neuronal cells from death. The prevailing
   treatment approach involves thrombolysis by administration of
   recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), albeit with a critical
   time constraint. Timely intervention is imperative, given that delayed
   thrombolysis increases tPA leakage into the brain parenchyma, causing
   harmful effects. Strategies to preserve tPA's vascular benefits while
   shielding brain cells from its toxicity have been explored. Notably,
   administering neuroserpin (Ns), a brain-specific tPA inhibitor,
   represents one such approach. Following ischemic stroke, Ns levels rise
   and correlate with favorable post-stroke outcomes. Studies in rodent
   models of focal cerebral ischemia have demonstrated the beneficial
   effects of Ns administration. Ns treatment maintains blood-brain barrier
   (BBB) integrity, reducing stroke volume. Conversely, Ns-deficient
   animals exhibit larger stroke injury, increased BBB permeability and
   enhanced microglia activation. Furthermore, Ns administration extends
   the therapeutic window for tPA intervention, underscoring its potential
   in stroke management. Remarkably, our investigation reveals the presence
   of Ns within extracellular vesicles (EVs), small membranesurrounded
   particles released by all cells and critical for intercellular
   communication. EVs influence disease outcome following stroke through
   cargo transfer between cells. Clarifying the role of EVs containing NS
   could open up urgently needed novel therapeutic approaches to improve
   post-ischemic stroke outcome.

AB Traumatic brain injury is a prevalent disorder of the central nervous
   system. In addition to primary brain parenchymal damage, the enduring
   biological consequences of traumatic brain injury pose long-term risks
   for patients with traumatic brain injury; however, the underlying
   pathogenesis remains unclear, and effective intervention methods are
   lacking. Intestinal dysfunction is a significant consequence of
   traumatic brain injury. Being the most densely innervated peripheral
   tissue in the body, the gut possesses multiple pathways for the
   establishment of a bidirectional "brain-gut axis" with the central
   nervous system. The gut harbors a vast microbial community, and
   alterations of the gut niche contribute to the progression of traumatic
   brain injury and its unfavorable prognosis through neuronal, hormonal,
   and immune pathways. A comprehensive understanding of
   microbiota-mediated peripheral neuroimmunomodulation mechanisms is
   needed to enhance treatment strategies for traumatic brain injury and
   its associated complications. We comprehensively reviewed alterations in
   the gut microecological environment following traumatic brain injury,
   with a specific focus on the complex biological processes of peripheral
   nerves, immunity, and microbes triggered by traumatic brain injury,
   encompassing autonomic dysfunction, neuroendocrine disturbances,
   peripheral immunosuppression, increased intestinal barrier permeability,
   compromised responses of sensory nerves to microorganisms, and potential
   effector nuclei in the central nervous system influenced by gut
   microbiota. Additionally, we reviewed the mechanisms underlying
   secondary biological injury and the dynamic pathological responses that
   occur following injury to enhance our current understanding of how
   peripheral pathways impact the outcome of patients with traumatic brain
   injury. This review aimed to propose a conceptual model for future risk
   assessment of central nervous system-related diseases while elucidating
   novel insights into the bidirectional effects of the
   "brain-gut-microbiota axis."

AB Diabetic corneal neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy are ocular
   complications occurring in the context of diabetes mellitus. Diabetic
   corneal neuropathy refers to the progressive damage of corneal nerves.
   Diabetic retinopathy has traditionally been considered as damage to the
   retinal microvasculature. However, growing evidence suggests that
   diabetic retinopathy is a complex neurovascular disorder resulting from
   dysfunction of the neurovascular unit, which includes both the retinal
   vascular structures and neural tissues. Diabetic retinopathy is one of
   the leading causes of blindness and is frequently screened for as part
   of diabetic ocular screening. However, diabetic corneal neuropathy is
   commonly overlooked and underdiagnosed, leading to severe ocular surface
   impairment. Several studies have found that these two conditions tend to
   occur together, and they share similarities in their pathogenesis
   pathways, being triggered by a status of chronic hyperglycemia. This
   review aims to discuss the interconnection between diabetic corneal
   neuropathy and diabetic retinopathy, whether diabetic corneal neuropathy
   precedes diabetic retinopathy, as well as the relation between the stage
   of diabetic retinopathy and the severity of corneal neuropathy. We also
   endeavor to explore the relevance of a corneal screening in diabetic
   eyes and the possibility of using corneal nerve measurements to monitor
   the progression of diabetic retinopathy.

AB Ischemic stroke is a secondary cause of mortality worldwide, imposing
   considerable medical and economic burdens on society. Extracellular
   vesicles, serving as natural nano-carriers for drug delivery, exhibit
   excellent biocompatibility in vivo and have significant advantages in
   the management of ischemic stroke. However, the uncertain distribution
   and rapid clearance of extracellular vesicles impede their delivery
   efficiency. By utilizing membrane decoration or by encapsulating
   therapeutic cargo within extracellular vesicles, their delivery efficacy
   may be greatly improved. Furthermore, previous studies have indicated
   that microvesicles, a subset of large-sized extracellular vesicles, can
   transport mitochondria to neighboring cells, thereby aiding in the
   restoration of mitochondrial function post-ischemic stroke. Small
   extracellular vesicles have also demonstrated the capability to transfer
   mitochondrial components, such as proteins or deoxyribonucleic acid, or
   their sub-components, for extracellular vesicle-based ischemic stroke
   therapy. In this review, we undertake a comparative analysis of the
   isolation techniques employed for extracellular vesicles and present an
   overview of the current dominant extracellular vesicle modification
   methodologies. Given the complex facets of treating ischemic stroke, we
   also delineate various extracellular vesicle modification approaches
   which are suited to different facets of the treatment process. Moreover,
   given the burgeoning interest in mitochondrial delivery, we delved into
   the feasibility and existing research findings on the transportation of
   mitochondrial fractions or intact mitochondria through small
   extracellular vesicles and microvesicles to offer a fresh perspective on
   ischemic stroke therapy.

AB Neuromodulation for diabetic peripheral neuropathy represents a
   significant area of interest in the management of chronic pain
   associated with this condition. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy, a common
   complication of diabetes, is characterized by nerve damage due to high
   blood sugar levels that lead to symptoms, such as pain, tingling, and
   numbness, primarily in the hands and feet. The aim of this systematic
   review was to evaluate the efficacy of neuromodulatory techniques as
   potential therapeutic interventions for patients with diabetic
   peripheral neuropathy, while also examining recent developments in this
   domain. The investigation encompassed an array of neuromodulation
   methods, including frequency rhythmic electrical modulated systems,
   dorsal root ganglion stimulation, and spinal cord stimulation. This
   systematic review suggests that neuromodulatory techniques may be useful
   in the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Understanding the
   advantages of these treatments will enable physicians and other
   healthcare providers to offer additional options for patients with
   symptoms refractory to standard pharmacologic treatments. Through these
   efforts, we may improve quality of life and increase functional capacity
   in patients suffering from complications related to diabetic neuropathy.

AB Regulated cell death (such as apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis,
   autophagy, cuproptosis, ferroptosis, disulfidptosis) involves complex
   signaling pathways and molecular effectors, and has been proven to be an
   important regulatory mechanism for regulating neuronal aging and death.
   However, excessive activation of regulated cell death may lead to the
   progression of aging-related diseases. This review summarizes recent
   advances in the understanding of seven forms of regulated cell death in
   age-related diseases. Notably, the newly identified ferroptosis and
   cuproptosis have been implicated in the risk of cognitive impairment and
   neurodegenerative diseases. These forms of cell death exacerbate disease
   progression by promoting inflammation, oxidative stress, and
   pathological protein aggregation. The review also provides an overview
   of key signaling pathways and crosstalk mechanisms among these regulated
   cell death forms, with a focus on ferroptosis, cuproptosis, and
   disulfidptosis. For instance, FDX1 directly induces cuproptosis by
   regulating copper ion valency and dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase
   aggregation, while copper mediates glutathione peroxidase 4 degradation,
   enhancing ferroptosis sensitivity. Additionally, inhibiting the Xc-
   transport system to prevent ferroptosis can increase disulfide formation
   and shift the NADP+/NADPH ratio, transitioning ferroptosis to
   disulfidptosis. These insights help to uncover the potential connections
   among these novel regulated cell death forms and differentiate them from
   traditional regulated cell death mechanisms. In conclusion, identifying
   key targets and their crosstalk points among various regulated cell
   death pathways may aid in developing specific biomarkers to reverse the
   aging clock and treat age-related neurodegenerative conditions.

AB Alzheimer's disease poses a significant global health challenge owing to
   the progressive cognitive decline of patients and absence of curative
   treatments. The current therapeutic strategies, primarily based on
   cholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists,
   offer limited symptomatic relief without halting disease progression,
   highlighting an urgent need for novel research directions that address
   the key mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have
   provided insights into the critical role of glycolysis, a fundamental
   energy metabolism pathway in the brain, in the pathogenesis of
   Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in glycolytic processes within neurons
   and glial cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes,
   have been identified as significant contributors to the pathological
   landscape of Alzheimer's disease. Glycolytic changes impact neuronal
   health and function, thus offering promising targets for therapeutic
   intervention. The purpose of this review is to consolidate current
   knowledge on the modifications in glycolysis associated with Alzheimer's
   disease and explore the mechanisms by which these abnormalities
   contribute to disease onset and progression. Comprehensive focus on the
   pathways through which glycolytic dysfunction influences Alzheimer's
   disease pathology should provide insights into potential therapeutic
   targets and strategies that pave the way for groundbreaking treatments,
   emphasizing the importance of understanding metabolic processes in the
   quest for clarification and management of Alzheimer's disease.

AB The complex morphological, anatomical, physiological, and chemical
   mechanisms within the aging brain have been the hot topic of research
   for centuries. The aging process alters the brain structure that affects
   functions and cognitions, but the worsening of such processes
   contributes to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as
   Alzheimer's disease. Beyond these observable, mild morphological shifts,
   significant functional modifications in neurotransmission and neuronal
   activity critically influence the aging brain. Understanding these
   changes is important for maintaining cognitive health, especially given
   the increasing prevalence of age-related conditions that affect
   cognition. This review aims to explore the age-induced changes in brain
   plasticity and molecular processes, differentiating normal aging from
   the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, thereby providing insights into
   predicting the risk of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease.

AB Patients with complete spinal cord injury retain the potential for
   volitional muscle activity in muscles located below the spinal injury
   level. However, because of prolonged inactivity, initial attempts to
   activate these muscles may not effectively engage any of the remaining
   neurons in the descending pathway. A previous study unexpectedly found
   that a brief clinical round of passive activity significantly increased
   volitional muscle activation, as measured by surface electromyography.
   In this study, we further explored the effect of passive activity on
   surface electromyographic signals during volitional control tasks among
   individuals with complete spinal cord injury. Eleven patients with
   chronic complete thoracic spinal cord injury were recruited. Surface
   electromyography data from eight major leg muscles were acquired and
   compared before and after the passive activity protocol. The results
   indicated that the passive activity led to an increased number of
   activated volitional muscles and an increased frequency of activation.
   Although the cumulative root mean square of surface electromyography
   amplitude for volitional control of movement showed a slight increase
   after passive activity, the difference was not statistically
   significant. These findings suggest that brief passive activity may
   enhance the ability to initiate volitional muscle activity during
   surface electromyography tasks and underscore the potential of passive
   activity for improving residual motor control among patients with motor
   complete spinal cord injury.

AB Several promising plasma biomarker proteins, such as amyloid-beta (A
   beta), tau, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic
   protein, are widely used for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative
   diseases. However, little is known about the long-term stability of
   these biomarker proteins in plasma samples stored at -80 degrees C. We
   aimed to explore how storage time would affect the diagnostic accuracy
   of these biomarkers using a large cohort. Plasma samples from 229
   cognitively unimpaired individuals, encompassing healthy controls and
   those experiencing subjective cognitive decline, as well as 99 patients
   with cognitive impairment, comprising those with mild cognitive
   impairment and dementia, were acquired from the Sino Longitudinal Study
   on Cognitive Decline project. These samples were stored at -80 degrees C
   for up to 6 years before being used in this study. Our results showed
   that plasma levels of A beta 42, A beta 40, neurofilament light chain,
   and glial fibrillary acidic protein were not significantly correlated
   with sample storage time. However, the level of total tau showed a
   negative correlation with sample storage time. Notably, in individuals
   without cognitive impairment, plasma levels of total protein and tau
   phosphorylated protein threonine 181 (p-tau181)also showed a negative
   correlation with sample storage time. This was not observed in
   individuals with cognitive impairment. Consequently, we speculate that
   the diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau181 and the p-tau181 to total tau
   ratio may be influenced by sample storage time. Therefore, caution is
   advised when using these plasma biomarkers for the identification of
   neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, in
   cohort studies, it is important to consider the impact of storage time
   on the overall results.

AB Aims & objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine
   whether an active cancer diagnosis results in an increased risk of
   perioperative TJA complications and postoperative mortality. The
   secondary objective is to analyze the effects of demographic factors on
   perioperative complication rates in cancer patients undergoing TJA.
   Materials & methods: Patients with active cancer diagnoses undergoing
   total joint arthroplasty from 2014 to 2020 were included in this
   retrospective analysis. Patient data was obtained through ReachNet,
   which consisted of data from the University Medical Center, Tulane
   University Medical Center, Ochsner Health System, and Baylor Scott &
   White Health. ICD-9/10 codes were tagged for active cancer diagnoses
   within 365 days before surgery or 30 days after surgery to establish our
   active cancer population. Acute surgical complications within 30 days
   were identified by ICD codes. Results: Patient demographics included
   predominantly male (51.5 %), white (83 %), and non-Hispanic (96.5 %)
   patients followed by black individuals (15.9 %) with 47.5 % of patients
   being smokers. Cancer patients did have a higher acute complication rate
   (2.6 % vs 1.7 %), but this difference was not significant (p = .139).
   This difference was higher but also not significant after adjustment
   (aOR =1.32, 95 % CI = 0.71-2.43, p = .377). After adjustment, increased
   Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), white race and non-elective surgery
   were significant contributors to complication risk. Complication rates
   decreased significantly with year. Nonelective surgeries were also
   associated with higher complication rates (8.2 % vs. 1.8 %, p = .014).
   Conclusion: Patients with active cancer diagnoses demonstrated higher
   unadjusted rates of TJA acute surgical complications and increased
   adjusted CCI when compared to non-cancer patients. Identifying risk
   factors and demographics correlated with increased perioperative
   complications may provide physicians with necessary information to avoid
   negative TJA outcomes in cancer patients.

AB Subarachnoid hemorrhage leads to a series of pathological changes,
   including vascular spasm, cellular apoptosis, blood-brain barrier
   damage, cerebral edema, and white matter injury. Microglia, which are
   the key immune cells in the central nervous system, maintain homeostasis
   in the neural environment, support neurons, mediate apoptosis,
   participate in immune regulation, and have neuroprotective effects.
   Increasing evidence has shown that microglia play a pivotal role in the
   pathogenesis of subarachnoid hemorrhage and affect the process of injury
   and the prognosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Moreover, microglia play
   certain neuroprotective roles in the recovery phase of subarachnoid
   hemorrhage. Several approaches aimed at modulating microglia function
   are believed to attenuate subarachnoid hemorrhage injury. This provides
   new targets and ideas for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   However, an in-depth and comprehensive summary of the role of microglia
   after subarachnoid hemorrhage is still lacking. This review describes
   the activation of microglia after subarachnoid hemorrhage and their
   roles in the pathological processes of vasospasm, neuroinflammation,
   neuronal apoptosis, blood-brain barrier disruption, cerebral edema, and
   cerebral white matter lesions. It also discusses the neuroprotective
   roles of microglia during recovery from subarachnoid hemorrhage and
   therapeutic advances aimed at modulating microglial function after
   subarachnoid hemorrhage. Currently, microglia in subarachnoid hemorrhage
   are targeted with TLR inhibitors, nuclear factor-kappa B and STAT3
   pathway inhibitors, glycine/tyrosine kinases, NLRP3 signaling pathway
   inhibitors, Gasdermin D inhibitors, vincristine receptor alpha receptor
   agonists, ferroptosis inhibitors, genetic modification techniques, stem
   cell therapies, and traditional Chinese medicine. However, most of these
   are still being evaluated at the laboratory stage. More clinical studies
   and data on subarachnoid hemorrhage are required to improve the
   treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

AB Spinal muscular atrophy is a devastating motor neuron disease
   characterized by severe cases of fatal muscle weakness. It is one of the
   most common genetic causes of mortality among infants aged less than 2
   years. Biomarker research is currently receiving more attention, and new
   candidate biomarkers are constantly being discovered. This review
   initially discusses the evaluation methods commonly used in clinical
   practice while briefly outlining their respective pros and cons. We also
   describe recent advancements in research and the clinical significance
   of molecular biomarkers for spinal muscular atrophy, which are
   classified as either specific or non-specific biomarkers. This review
   provides new insights into the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy,
   the mechanism of biomarkers in response to drug-modified therapies, the
   selection of biomarker candidates, and would promote the development of
   future research. Furthermore, the successful utilization of biomarkers
   may facilitate the implementation of gene-targeting treatments for
   patients with spinal muscular atrophy.

AB Various nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems for the treatment of
   neurological disorders have been widely studied. However, their
   inability to cross the blood-brain barrier hampers the clinical
   translation of these therapeutic strategies. Liposomes are nanoparticles
   composed of lipid bilayers, which can effectively encapsulate drugs and
   improve drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier and into brain
   tissue through their targeting and permeability. Therefore, they can
   potentially treat traumatic and nontraumatic central nervous system
   diseases. In this review, we outlined the common properties and
   preparation methods of liposomes, including thin-film hydration,
   reverse-phase evaporation, solvent injection techniques, detergent
   removal methods, and microfluidics techniques. Afterwards, we
   comprehensively discussed the current applications of liposomes in
   central nervous system diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease,
   Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, and brain tumors.
   Most studies related to liposomes are still in the laboratory stage and
   have not yet entered clinical trials. Additionally, their application as
   drug delivery systems in clinical practice faces challenges such as drug
   stability, targeting efficiency, and safety. Therefore, we proposed
   development strategies related to liposomes to further promote their
   development in neurological disease research.

AB Every day walking consists of frequent voluntary modifications in the
   gait pattern to negotiate obstacles. After spinal cord injury, stepping
   over an obstacle becomes challenging. Stepping over an obstacle requires
   sensorimotor transformations in several structures of the brain,
   including the parietal cortex, premotor cortex, and motor cortex.
   Sensory information and planning are transformed into motor commands,
   which are sent from the motor cortex to spinal neuronal circuits to
   alter limb trajectory, coordinate the limbs, and maintain balance. After
   spinal cord injury, bidirectional communication between the brain and
   spinal cord is disrupted and animals, including humans, fail to
   voluntarily modify limb trajectory to step over an obstacle. Therefore,
   in this review, we discuss the neuromechanical control of stepping over
   an obstacle, why it fails after spinal cord injury, and how it recovers
   to a certain extent.

AB The oral cavity is a complex physiological community encompassing a wide
   range of microorganisms. Dysbiosis of oral microbiota can lead to
   various oral infectious diseases, such as periodontitis and tooth decay,
   and even affect systemic health, including brain aging and
   neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have highlighted how oral
   microbes might be involved in brain aging and neurodegeneration,
   indicating potential avenues for intervention strategies. In this
   review, we summarize clinical evidence demonstrating a link between oral
   microbes/oral infectious diseases and brain aging/neurodegenerative
   diseases, and dissect potential mechanisms by which oral microbes
   contribute to brain aging and neurodegeneration. We also highlight
   advances in therapeutic development grounded in the realm of oral
   microbes, with the goal of advancing brain health and promoting healthy
   aging.

AB The blood-brain barrier constitutes a dynamic and interactive boundary
   separating the central nervous system and the peripheral circulation. It
   tightly modulates the ion transport and nutrient influx, while
   restricting the entry of harmful factors, and selectively limiting the
   migration of immune cells, thereby maintaining brain homeostasis.
   Despite the well-established association between blood-brain barrier
   disruption and most neurodegenerative/neuroinflammatory diseases, much
   remains unknown about the factors influencing its physiology and the
   mechanisms underlying its breakdown. Moreover, the role of blood-brain
   barrier breakdown in the translational failure underlying therapies for
   brain disorders is just starting to be understood. This review aims to
   revisit this concept of "blood-brain barrier breakdown," delving into
   the most controversial aspects, prevalent challenges, and knowledge gaps
   concerning the lack of blood-brain barrier integrity. By moving beyond
   the oversimplistic dichotomy of an "open"/"bad" or a "closed"/"good"
   barrier, our objective is to provide a more comprehensive insight into
   blood-brain barrier dynamics, to identify novel targets and/or
   therapeutic approaches aimed at mitigating blood-brain barrier
   dysfunction. Furthermore, in this review, we advocate for considering
   the diverse time- and location-dependent alterations in the blood-brain
   barrier, which go beyond tight-junction disruption or brain endothelial
   cell breakdown, illustrated through the dynamics of ischemic stroke as a
   case study. Through this exploration, we seek to underscore the
   complexity of blood-brain barrier dysfunction and its implications for
   the pathogenesis and therapy of brain diseases.

AB Post-traumatic stress disorder is a mental disorder caused by exposure
   to severe traumatic life events. Currently, there are no validated
   biomarkers or laboratory tests that can distinguish between trauma
   survivors with and without post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition,
   the heterogeneity of clinical presentations of post-traumatic stress
   disorder and the overlap of symptoms with other conditions can lead to
   misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Evidence suggests that this
   condition is a multisystem disorder that affects many biological
   systems, raising the possibility that peripheral markers of disease may
   be used to diagnose post-traumatic stress disorder. We performed a
   PubMed search for microRNAs (miRNAs) in post-traumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD) that could serve as diagnostic biomarkers and found 18 original
   research articles on studies performed with human patients and published
   January 2012 to December 2023. These included four studies with whole
   blood, seven with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, four with plasma
   extracellular vesicles/exosomes, and one with serum exosomes. One of
   these studies had also used whole plasma. Two studies were excluded as
   they did not involve microRNA biomarkers. Most of the studies had
   collected samples from adult male Veterans who had returned from
   deployment and been exposed to combat, and only two were from recently
   traumatized adult subjects. In measuring miRNA expression levels, many
   of the studies had used microarray miRNA analysis, miRNA Seq analysis,
   or NanoString panels. Only six studies had used real time polymerase
   chain reaction assay to determine/validate miRNA expression in PTSD
   subjects compared to controls. The miRNAs that were found/validated in
   these studies may be considered as potential candidate biomarkers for
   PTSD and include miR-3130-5p in whole blood; miR-193a-5p, -7113-5p,
   -125a, -181c, and -671-5p in peripheral blood mononuclear cells;
   miR-10b-5p, -203a-3p, -4488, -502-3p, -874-3p, -5100, and -7641 in
   plasma extracellular vesicles/exosomes; and miR-18a-3p and -7-1-5p in
   blood plasma. Several important limitations identified in the studies
   need to be taken into account in future studies. Further studies are
   warranted with war veterans and recently traumatized children,
   adolescents, and adults having PTSD and use of animal models subjected
   to various stressors and the effects of suppressing or overexpressing
   specific microRNAs.

AB Stroke and Alzheimer's disease are common neurological disorders and
   often occur in the same individuals. The comorbidity of the two
   neurological disorders represents a grave health threat to older
   populations. This review presents a brief background of the development
   of novel concepts and their clinical potentials. The activity of
   glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx is critical for neuronal function. An
   ischemic insult induces prompt and excessive glutamate release and
   drastic increases of intracellular Ca2+ mainly via N-methyl-D-aspartate
   receptors, particularly of those at the extrasynaptic site. This
   Ca2+-evoked neuronal cell death in the ischemic core is dominated by
   necrosis within a few hours and days known as acute excitotoxicity.
   Furthermore, mild but sustained Ca2+ increases under neurodegenerative
   conditions such as in the distant penumbra of the ischemic brain and
   early stages of Alzheimer's disease are not immediately toxic, but
   gradually set off deteriorating Ca2+-dependent signals and neuronal cell
   loss mostly because of activation of programmed cell death pathways.
   Based on the Ca2+ hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and recent advances,
   this Ca2+-activated "silent" degenerative excitotoxicity evolves from
   years to decades and is recognized as a unique slow and chronic
   neuropathogenesis. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit GluN3A,
   primarily at the extrasynaptic site, serves as a gatekeeper for the
   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity and is neuroprotective against
   both acute and chronic excitotoxicity. Ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's
   disease, therefore, share an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor- and
   Ca2+-mediated mechanism, although with much different time courses. It
   is thus proposed that early interventions to control Ca2+ homeostasis at
   the preclinical stage are pivotal for individuals who are susceptible to
   sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease-related
   dementia. This early treatment simultaneously serves as a
   preconditioning therapy against ischemic stroke that often attacks the
   same individuals during abnormal aging.

   among different groups of residents in Al-Anbar Province. The Fallujah
   Teaching Hospital, Al-Ramadi Maternity, Children's Hospital, IDP camps,
   prestigious medical facilities in Al-Anbar Province, and privately held
   laboratories were among the medical facilities from which these
   individuals sought care. Children, adults, boys, and girls were
   represented in the 420 stool and blood serum samples that were collected
   and sent to private laboratories. A 14.3% Cryptosporidium spp. infection
   was discovered in 60 of the individuals who had been examined. Based on
   microscopic, 360 individuals tested negative for Cryptosporidium spp.
   indicating an 85.7% non-infection proportion. The study comprised 28
   (46.7%) men and 32 (53.3%) women. Notably, the greatest infection
   incidence was seen in the age category of 1 to 14 years, with 21 people
   (15.3%) afflicted. Regarding residence, 37 patients (15.7%) were from
   rural regions, whereas 23 (12.5%) were from metropolitan areas. The
   study also found that Cryptosporidium spp. infections are seasonal, with
   the largest infection rates (31.80%) occurring throughout the summer
   months of April 2022, July 2022, and August 2022. Furthermore, the study
   used ELISA testing, which found that 22 serum samples (22.9%) were
   positive. IgM ELISA findings showed a 10.40% positive rate, whereas IgG
   results showed a 12.50% positivity rate for Cryptosporidium spp. These
   data were acquired by the ELISA technique.

AB P LATELET rich fibrin (PRF) derived from peripheral blood (pb-prf) is
   the one of most new and commonly utilized platelet concentrate in
   medical therapeutic field. It has an essential role in tissue repair and
   healing as it is a source for a wide range of different types of growth
   factors, anti-inflammatory and post-inflammatory molecules. On the other
   hand, recently bone marrow has been used as a source for PRF to
   accelerate wound healing instead of arterial or venous peripheral blood
   source. This experiment was carried out to study the effect of bone
   marrow derived PRF, which also called solid bone marrow aspirate
   concentrate (sBMAC)) on full thickness skin autograft take,
   incorporation, survival and healing, and also to compare its influence
   with effect of pb-prf . Our current study comprised 27 dogs in which
   skin autografting were done, and were divided into three groups. A
   control group, in which graft was carried out without any treatment;
   pb-prf group, in which graft was treated with PRF derived from
   peripheral blood and sBMAC group, in which graft was treated with PRF
   derived from bone marrow. The site of grafting was inspected
   macroscopically during 28 days after graft implantation. The
   histopathological assessment for grafting area was achieved at 7 th , 14
   th and 28 th days after operation. Results showed that the two types of
   PRF had a stimulation impact in skin graft incorporation with grafted
   wound bed and healing, that was characterized by 100% graft acceptance,
   excellent cosmetic graft appearance, enhancement of granulation tissue
   creation and maturation, faster reepithelization, better graft survival
   in contrast to control group, which displayed a partial graft separation
   and late granulation tissue maturation, reepithelization and healing.
   Besides that, the sBMAC graft treatment had shown a better healing
   outcome during the all phases of the graft healing process in comparison
   with the pb-prf. In conclusion, the sBMAC had a greater effectiveness
   than the pb-prf in full thickness skin autograft healing.

AB T HIS study conducted on twenty-four Wistar rats suggests that curcumin
   holds promise for enhancing wound healing. Through dividing the rats
   into control and treated groups, along with the creation of experimental
   excisional skin wounds on their backs, the effects of curcumin ointment
   were evaluated and compared to the non -treated group. The results
   indicated significant improvements in wound healing among the group
   treated with curcumin ointment compared to the control group.
   Specifically, the treatment group exhibited excessive angiogenesis,
   which refers to the outgrowth of newly formed blood vessels, the
   fundamental element for providing oxygen and nutrients to the newly
   growing tissues. The increase in the intensity of granulation tissue
   could indicate improved wound -bed preparation and tissue regeneration.
   The enhanced epidermal reepithelialization observed in the treated group
   suggests expedited wound closure and tissue regeneration. These findings
   underscore the multifaceted effects of curcumin, including its
   antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, which
   likely contribute to its positive effects on wound healing. By reducing
   inflammation, combating oxidative -stress, and preventing microbial
   colonization, curcumin creates an optimal environment for efficient
   wound healing. Overall, the study supports the potent effects of
   curcumin as a medical support in wound care, highlighting its
   versatility as a natural treatment option for promoting wound healing
   and preventing complications. However, further studies and clinical
   investigation are recommended to and clinical trials are necessary to
   advocate these findings, and to optimize the accurate dosages of
   curcumin for wound management in human patients.

   due to their ability to survive in a hospital environment cause
   nosocomial infections and develop various resistance mechanisms as an
   acquisition of multiple genes to resist antibiotics, especially
   carbapenem, it can hydrolyze this antibiotic because it has class D
   beta-lactamases (oxacillinases). Our study focused on determining the
   existence of the blaOxa23 gene in strains of Acinetobacter baumannii
   resistant to many antibiotics isolated from various clinical samples in
   Mosul City, IRAQ , Three hundred samples (environmental and clinical)
   were collected from hospitals and the Burns Center in Mosul City, Iraq,
   During September 21, 2023, and January 1, 2024.The samples were cultured
   on MacConkey medium as a differentiation medium for Gram-negative
   bacteria, and biochemical tests, IMVIC test, and molecular diagnosis
   were performed. Out of 200 clinical sample and 100 environmental sample
   24 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii were detected, DNA was extracted,
   and PCR was applied to discover the genes of blaOxa23 . The outcomes
   revealed possesses the blaOxa23 gene in all selected bacterial strains
   resulting in a product size of 501 base pairs, our results indicate a

AB Dynamic changes in sarcopenia status following stressor events are
   defined as acute sarcopenia; it is currently unknown how to stratify
   risk. Prospective observational study involving elective colorectal
   surgery, emergency abdominal surgery, and medical pa tients with
   infections aged >= 70 years -old. Handgrip strength, muscle quantity
   (ultrasound Bilateral Anterior Thigh Thickness, BATT, and Bioelectrical
   Impedance Analysis), and muscle quality (rectus femoris echogenicity)
   were measured preoperatively in the elective group, and within 48hours,
   7days after, and 13weeks after admission/surgery. Serum/plasma samples
   were collected preoperatively (elective group) and within 48hours of
   admission/surgery (all groups). LASSO models adjusting for baseline
   sarcopenia status were performed. Seventy-nine participants were
   included (mean age 79.1, 39.2% female). Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
   Disease (COPD) (48hours beta 0.67, CI 0.59-0.75), and prescription of
   steroids during admission (48hours beta 1.11, CI 0.98-1.24) - 1.24) were
   positively associated with sarcopenia at 7days. Delirium was negatively
   associated with change in BATT to 7days (7days beta -0.47, CI -0.5- - -
   0.44). COPD (Preoperative beta 0.35, CI 0.12-0.58) and delirium (48hours
   beta 0.13, CI 0.06-0.2) - 0.2) were positively associated with change in
   echogenicity to 7days in analysis including systemic biomarkers.
   Participants with sarcopenia at baseline had higher IL -7 concentrations
   during acute phase of illness (median 8.78pg/mL vs 6.52pg/mL; p=0.014).
   IL -1b within 48hours of admission/surgery was positively associated
   with sarcopenia status at 7days (beta 0.24, CI 0.06- 0.42). Patients
   most at risk of acute sarcopenia or reductions in muscle quantity and
   quality included those prescribed steroids, with COPD or delirium, or
   with heightened systemic inflammation.

AB Currently, the primary approach for treating radioactive isotopes all
   over the world is a great challenge. The impact of this treatment is to
   transform liquid radioactive wastewater (present in huge volume) into
   low-volume solid radioactive waste. The current work presents synthesis
   and application of novel adsorbent using beta-lactoglobulin fibrils
   (beta Fs) on SiO2 particles and activated carbon particles (AC
   particles), which considered as facile and ecologically conscious. beta
   Fs were produced by denaturing inexpensive beta-lactoglobulin. This
   method of filtering was used for radioactive waste, which differs from
   most prior adsorption techniques. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) was grafted
   onto protein fibrils using polydopamine (PDA). The produced material
   shows highly removal performance of TcO4- under both acidic and alkaline
   conditions (up to 99.76 %, with filtering time of just 5-6 min). This
   membrane exhibits a superior preference for TcO4- over certain common
   competing ions, including SO42-, NO3-, and Cl-. The hybrid membrane
   achieves maximum adsorption performance for the substituted ion ReO4- of
   533 mg/g, which is higher than the most commonly used fiber materials.
   Furthermore, beta Fs-PDA + PEI fibrils can efficiently treat up to 8000
   kg of wastewater per kg and exhibit remarkable reusability performance.
   This membrane's simple production, efficient performance, and excellent
   selectivity make it ideal to be implemented in both hospitals and
   nuclear power plants.

AB Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a potentially life-threatening
   vascular disease primarily in the male elderly population, but there is
   a lack of approved medical therapies to prevent the progression and
   rupture of AAA. Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) has been
   established to be involved in cardiovascular diseases, such as heart
   failure and calcific aortic valve disease. However, the role of ATF4 in
   the pathogenesis of AAA remains unclear. We found that ATF4 expression
   was significantly increased in patients with AAA and mouse models of AAA
   and was mainly confined to macrophages in arteries. ATF4 knockdown
   significantly attenuated aneurysm formation in experimental mouse model
   of AAA, while ATF4 overexpression promoted the development of AAA. RNA
   sequencing suggested that ATF4 was strongly related to the biological
   function of acute inflammatory response. Macrophages-specific ATF4
   knockout significantly reduced the incidence and development of AAA, and
   decreased M1 polarization of macrophages in mice. Sphingomyelin
   phosphodiesterase 3 (SMPD3), a regulator of inflammatory responses in
   monocytes/macrophages, has been identified as a target gene of ATF4
   through RNA sequencing, ChIP sequencing, and standard ChIP analyses.
   ATF4 induces M1 polarization of macrophages through the activation of
   SMPD3, thereby promoting inflammatory responses. Together, these results
   suggest that ATF4 mediated macrophage M1 polarization by regulating the
   expression of target genes SMPD3, leading to an increased inflammatory
   response, which further promotes the formation and development of AAA.
   These findings suggest ATF4 may be a new therapeutic target for AAA.

   23,733 adults aged >= 65 years with a diagnosis of dementia and 249,749
   matched adults without dementia. Data were collected at baseline (March
   -October 2023), and two follow-up timepoints (December 2023 and February
   2024), bracketing an armed conflict between Israel and Palestinian
   militant groups that began on October 7, 2023. We compared changes over
   time in clinical characteristics, medication use, healthcare
   utilization, costs between groups. Dementia prevalence was stable, but
   psychotropic medication use declined more sharply in those with
   dementia. Rates of depression diagnoses fell, and obesity rose in both
   groups. Healthcare utilization decreased substantially post -conflict,
   with fewer outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and emergency visits.
   Cost divergence between groups also increased over time. Machine
   learning identified shifting clusters of service users from high to
   mainly low users' post -conflict. The conflict severely disrupted
   routine dementia care and altered health behaviors. Flexible service
   delivery and access promotion strategies are needed to support
   vulnerable populations like people with dementia during crises.

AB Introduction: Prediabetes represents a significant public health
   challenge in Latin America. Its prevalence varies considerably depending
   on the diagnostic criteria used, which hinders a precise understanding
   of its magnitude in the region.
   Objective: To estimate the prevalence and incidence of prediabetes in
   Latin America through a systematic review (SR).
   Methods: A SR and meta-analysis was conducted searching through October
   25, 2024 in SCOPUS, EMBASE, Web of Science, and PubMed. Studies were
   included if they: (1) used probabilistic sampling methods, (2) included
   adult participants (≥18 years), (3) assessed prediabetes using WHO
   criteria, fasting glucose, postprandial glucose, or HbA1c, and (4) were
   published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. Studies using
   non-probabilistic sampling, focusing on specific medical conditions, or
   lacking sufficient data to calculate prevalence or incidence were
   excluded. Random-effect models were used to estimate pooled prevalence,
   with heterogeneity assessed using I statistics and publication bias
   through funnel plots.
   Results: Twenty-five studies from 9 countries published between 1992 and
   2023 were analyzed. The pooled prevalence of prediabetes was 24% (95%
   CI: 18-30%). According to specific criteria, the prevalences were: WHO
   11% (95% CI: 5-18%), FG 18% (95% CI: 10-27%), PPG 20% (95% CI: 3-46%),
   and HbA1c 32% (95% CI: 21-52%). High heterogeneity was observed among
   studies (I = 99-100%, p<0.001). Only one study analyzed the incidence,
   which was 12.8%.
   Conclusions: Prediabetes prevalence in Latin America is high, with
   significant variations by diagnostic criteria. The limited number of
   incidence studies and high heterogeneity highlight the need for
   standardized approaches in future research. Implementation of preventive
   strategies and strengthening of epidemiological surveillance systems are
   crucial for addressing this public health challenge.

AB Background: Demoralization is a complex construct comprising of several
   clinical phenomena that has gained increasing interest in clinical
   practice and research; however, the concept needs to be sufficiently
   specified and clearly described. A concept analysis of demoralization is
   necessary to integrate previous research findings and establish the
   scientific foundation for future intervention research. Aim: To analyze
   the concept of demoralization in terms of its antecedents, attributes,
   consequences, and empirical referents in health. Methods: A concept
   analysis was performed using the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines
   scoping review method and mapping information through the Walker and
   Avant concept analysis framework. Electronic databases, including
   PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, were
   searched until September 15, 2024. The grey literature and other minor
   non-indexed publications were also reviewed. Results: A total of 106
   articles were included in the review. Antecedents included medical
   illness, symptom burden, low social support and coping difficulties.
   Attributes were identified as follows: dysphoria, disheartenment,
   helplessness, hopelessness, loss of meaning and purpose, and sense of
   failure. Consequences included poor quality of life, depression,
   anxiety, suicidal ideation and desire to die. The concept of
   demoralization was illustrated through a model case, one exhibiting
   borderline criterion and another displaying challenge. Conclusion: This
   scoping review clarifies the clinical definition of demoralization,
   distinguishing it from common language usage and from other emotional
   symptoms frequently experienced by patients. Implications for Practice:
   The identified attributes of demoralization play vital roles in health
   assessments and should guide nurses in providing appropriate patient
   care early on. Interventions should address the concept's antecedents
   and consequences.

AB Background: Self-management support is widely considered a critical
   aspect of nursing. Still, many studies indicate that nurses frequently
   experience difficulties in daily practice. Objective: To gain a deeper
   understanding of the factors perceived by nurses to impede or promote
   their support of patients' self-management within the dynamic
   environment of the in-patient hospital setting. Design: Mixed methods
   design. Participants: Nurses (n = 269) working in a teaching hospital in
   the Netherlands completed a questionnaire. Subsequently, 38 nurses
   participated in interviews. Methods: The SEPSS-36 questionnaire assessed
   nurses' self-efficacy and performance in selfmanagement support.
   Semi-structured interviews were conducted to address salient results
   from the questionnaire, focusing on factors influencing self-management
   support, goal setting, follow-up care, and the nurse's role in a
   hospital setting. Results: the response rate for the questionnaire study
   was 62 %. A paired t-test revealed a significant mean difference of 6.30
   95 % CI [5.91-6.69] p <= 0.001 between nurses' perceived selfefficacy
   (mean = 18.34/24) and their actual performance (mean = 12.03/24) in
   self-management support. The interviews revealed that nurses typically
   focus on medical procedures and maintaining patients' functional status.
   Spending time with patients to offer emotional support was viewed as
   'something extra' rather than a core part of their job. High patient
   turnover hindered nurses from having meaningful conversations with
   patients. Conclusions: Short-term priorities such as 'getting the work
   done' dominate nurses' daily tasks in hospital wards, leading them to
   overlook often the benefits of supporting patient selfmanagement. This
   narrow view of their responsibilities can hinder patient care, whereas
   adopting a broader perspective on the patient journey could be very
   beneficial.

   fruitfully to an inclusive view of otherness through the understanding
   of the richness and diversity of medical cultural heritage. After a
   brief discussion about the role and function of current museums and the
   shiftfrom the traditional aspect of medical museums as "specialized
   spaces" to their perception as polyphonic spaces of inclusion, the focus
   turns to the Museum of Medicine at the University of Crete and the
   organization of its collections in thematic axes, in particular. The aim
   of the museum is to contribute to the preservation, research, and
   promotion ofthetangible and intangible cultural heritage related to
   medicine in Crete and beyond it, viewed from a wide temporal spectrum.
   The collections are organized in thematic axes, based on a
   multidisciplinary, anthropocentric, and inclusive approach which
   associates medicine with humanities and social sciences and focuses on
   the experience of health and illness through the patients' perspectives
   alongside those of the medical practitioners. The close examination of
   the axes and their interrelations illuminates, among others, the
   continuing and universal concerns for healing and treatment beyond
   boundaries and discriminations and the effect of medicine on people from
   various backgrounds. With its exhibition and relevant activities, the
   museum aims to raise awareness about the value of medical cultural
   heritage as an important element of understanding otherness and
   embracing inclusiveness.

AB Cancer is one of the diseases that kill the most women in the world,
   with breast cancer being responsible for the highest number of cancer
   cases and consequently deaths. However, it can be prevented by early
   detection and, consequently, early treatment. Any development for
   detection or perdition this kind of cancer is important for a better
   healthy life. Many studies focus on a model with high accuracy in cancer
   prediction, but sometimes accuracy alone may not always be a reliable
   metric. This study implies an investigative approach to studying the
   performance of different machine learning algorithms based on boosting
   to predict breast cancer focusing on the recall metric. Boosting machine
   learning algorithms has been proven to be an effective tool for
   detecting medical diseases. The dataset of the University of California,
   Irvine (UCI) repository has been utilized to train and test the model
   classifier that contains their attributes. The main objective of this
   study is to use state-of-the-art boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost,
   XGBoost, CatBoost and LightGBM to predict and diagnose breast cancer and
   to find the most effective metric regarding recall, ROC-AUC, and
   confusion matrix. Furthermore, previous studies have applied Optuna to
   individual algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM, but no prior research
   has collectively examined all four boosting algorithms within a unified
   Optuna framework, a library for hyperparameter optimization, and the
   SHAP method to improve the interpretability of our model, which can be
   used as a support to identify and predict breast cancer. We were able to
   improve AUC or recall for all the models and reduce the False Negative
   for AdaBoost and LigthGBM the final AUC were more than 99.41% for all

AB This research proposes an effective and reliable deep learning method
   for detecting brain abnormalities via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   The technique consists of two primary stages: first, a binary classifier
   that divides pictures into "Brain" and "Non-Brain" categories; second,
   multi-class classifiers that explicitly recognise categories such
   pituitary adenomas, gliomas, and meningiomas. The labelled and
   preprocessed data were taken from a collection of 7,753 pictures
   provided by Qhills Technologies Pvt. Ltd. Additional data from the Brain
   Tumour MRI collection was also incorporated to improve the model's
   generalisation skills. VGG-16 outperforms the other machine learning
   models, with an accuracy rate of 96.4%, when compared to ANN, CNN,
   VGG-16, and AlexNet. A thorough model evaluation and hyperparameter
   tweaking process was conducted using the accuracy, precision, recall
   F1-score. The findings of this study point to the potential of deep
   learning techniques in identifying brain disorders fast and precisely,
   opening the door to more precise diagnosis in clinical settings.

AB Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic condition affecting
   approximately 5 % of the global population, with significant prevalence
   in sub-Saharan Africa and an estimated 89,079 cases in the United
   States. Osteonecrosis, particularly of the femoral head (ONFH), is a
   common orthopaedic complication in SCD, often requiring total hip
   arthroplasty (THA) when conservative treatments fail. While THA can
   improve pain and function, it carries significant perioperative risks,
   with complication rates in patients with SCD as high as 67 %. This study
   aims to compare postoperative outcomes, medical costs, and the impact of
   different THA implant designs in patients with SCD versus a matched
   non-SCD cohort. Methods: The study utilized the National Inpatient
   Sample (NIS) database. Postoperative outcomes in patients with and
   without SCD undergoing total hip arthroplasty between the fourth quarter
   of 2015 and 2020 were analyzed using propensity score matching and
   multivariable logistic regression modeling. Additionally, a subgroup
   analysis examined outcomes based on the use of cemented versus
   non-cemented implants. Results: The study analyzed 2,830,040 hip
   arthroplasty patients, including 2535 with sickle cell disease (SCD),
   and after propensity score matching, found that patients with SCD had
   significantly higher rates of postoperative complications such as
   periprosthetic fractures, dislocations, infections, and acute kidney
   injury. Multivariate analysis confirmed SCD as an independent risk
   factor for these complications, along with increased hospital stays and
   higher charges. Additionally, patients with SCD receiving cemented
   implants experienced worse outcomes, including higher risks of
   periprosthetic fractures and infections, compared to those with
   non-cemented implants. Conclusion: This study found that patients with
   sickle cell disease (SCD) undergoing total hip arthroplasty had
   significantly higher complication rates, increased healthcare costs, and
   longer hospital stays, with cemented implants posing greater risks
   compared to press-fit implants.

AB Introduction: There is a lack of consensus regarding indications for
   fibula fixation in pilon fractures. Reduction of the fibula fracture can
   assist with restoring lateral column length and reduction of the tibial
   plafond during pilon ORIF. However, there are theoretical concerns with
   wound complications and soft tissue insult. The purpose of this study is
   to compare short-term outcome measures after tibial plafond ORIF with
   and without supplemental fibula fixation using a validated national
   database. Materials and methods: The American College of Surgeons' NSQIP
   database was utilized to identify all patients undergoing tibial plafond
   ORIF with and without fibula fixation between January 1, 2015 and
   December 31, 2020 using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes 27827
   and 27828, respectively. Open fractures and cases with concurrent open
   procedures were excluded from analysis. Demographic data, medical
   comorbidities, surgical variables, and various 30-day outcome measures
   were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression
   was used to identify independent variables associated with various
   outcome measure of interest. Results: A total of 3120 patients were
   included in the final cohort: 1530 patients underwent tibia fixation
   alone and 1590 patients underwent both tibia and fibula fixation. The
   supplemental fibula fixation group had a higher rate of reoperation (2.3
   % vs. 1.1 %, p = 0.013) and non-home discharge (14.8 % vs. 11.2 %, p =
   0.003). The rate of surgical site infection was comparable between
   groups. Supplemental fibula fixation was independently associated with
   unplanned reoperation (RR: 1.939 [1.081-3.477], p = 0.026). Conclusions:
   Patients undergoing supplemental fibula fixation during tibial plafond
   ORIF had a higher rate of 30day reoperation and non-home discharge.
   Supplemental fibula fixation during pilon fracture ORIF was
   independently associated with a higher rate of 30-day reoperation. There
   was no difference in the rates of surgical site infection or wound
   dehiscence between the two groups. Level of evidence: 3.

AB This paper provides an update on the sensors and actuators involved in
   Stem Cells (SC) differentiation processes based on electric stimulation
   (STIM), including both current and future progress. These techniques are
   applied in a range of biological and medical protocols, including cell
   linage derivation, tissue engineering, cellular therapy, cancer
   research, and cell motility. The typical methodology of SC electric STIM
   endeavors to emulate biological processes by applying an electrical
   signal to the cell culture and evaluating the cell response. Cell
   metabolism is electrically sensitive, responding in some manner to a
   given stimulus. The precise mechanism by which this occurs is not fully
   understood, but it is evident that changes in ion density at the cell
   membrane proximity must excite the cell metabolism (receptors), thereby
   activating its "differentiation" in response. In order to gain a deeper
   insight into the cellular mechanisms involved in this process, the
   physical variables should be better recognized, measured, and quantified
   during the protocol execution. This work is contributing to the
   development of a compilation of proposed systems, and specifications
   required, to identify and better understand the local conditions within
   the cell environment that are responsible for the activation of the
   differentiation processes. It is crucial that STIM systems are optimally
   designed and that the cell response is correctly understood. Two
   features will be reviewed: the setup employed and the circuits for STIM
   and monitoring. The nexus between these two elements are the electrodes,
   and this work will therefore be devoted to the realization of integrated
   Micro-Electrode Arrays (MEAs), and the design problems associated with
   it. The focus will be on MEAs, with the same size scale as the cells,
   and the design issues related to integrated electrodes, under electric
   stimulation, voltage or current modes.

AB Background: HIV infection in patients undergoing Total joint
   arthroplasty (TJA) results in adverse postoperative outcomes. However,
   there are uncertain data regarding the extent of involvement of HIV in
   TJA and the individual complications associated with it. Therefore, we
   planned to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the
   risk of HIV in causing complications after TJA. Methods: Electronic
   databases such as PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar from inception
   till May 1, 2023. Studies evaluating complications in HIV-infected
   patients following TJA were selected. Statistical Analysis was performed
   through Revman. Results: A total of 16 studies evaluating 17,974,549
   patients were included in the meta-analysis. HIV-infected patients were
   at increased risk of developing infectious complications (OR 1.82 [1.49,
   2.22]; p < 0.00001; I-2 = 62 %), medical complications (OR 1.85 [1.41,
   2.42]; p <0.00001; I-2 = 82.8 %) and surgical complications (OR 1.58
   [1.38, 1.82]; p < 0.00001; I-2 = 76 %) following TJA. On subgroup
   analysis, we found that there was an increased risk of infectious (OR
   1.67 [1.19, 2.34]; p = 0.003; I-2 = 70 %), medical (OR 1.24 [1.03,
   1.48]; p = 0.02; I-2 = 79 %) and surgical complications (OR 1.35 [1.09,
   1.67]; p = 0.007; I-2 = 69 %) following Total knee arthroplasty. As well
   as there was an increased risk of infectious (OR 1.76 [1.26, 2.46]; p =
   0.0001; I-2 = 0 %), medical (OR 1.54 [1.12, 2.12; p = 0.007; I-2 = 85
   %), and surgical complications (OR 1.50 [1.22, 1.86]; p = 0.0002; I2 = 0
   %) following Total hip arthroplasty. Conclusion: HIV-infected patients
   are at an increased risk of complications following TJA. Knowledge
   regarding these individual complications will result in better
   monitoring and post-operative care.

AB Microrobots powered by an external magnetic field could be used for
   sophisticated medical applications such as cell treatment,
   micromanipulation, and noninvasive surgery inside the body. Untethered
   microrobot applications can benefit from haptic technology and
   telecommunication, enabling telemedical micro-manipulation. Users can
   manipulate the microrobots with haptic feedback by interacting with the
   robot operating system remotely in such applications. Artificially
   created haptic forces based on wirelessly transmitted data and
   model-based guidance can aid human operators with haptic sensations
   while manipulating microrobots. The system presented here includes a
   haptic device and a magnetic tweezer system linked together using a
   network-based teleoperation method with motion models in fluids. The
   magnetic microrobots can be controlled remotely, and the haptic
   interactions with the remote environment can be felt in real time. A
   time-domain passivity controller is applied to overcome network delay
   and ensure stability of communication. This study develops and tests a
   motion model for microrobots and evaluates two image-based 3D tracking
   algorithms to improve tracking accuracy in various Newtonian fluids.
   Additionally, it demonstrates that microrobots can group together to
   transport multiple larger objects, move through microfluidic channels
   for detailed tasks, and use a novel method for disassembly, greatly
   expanding their range of use in microscale operations. Remote medical
   treatment in multiple locations, remote delivery of medication without
   the need for physical penetration of the skin, and remotely controlled
   cell manipulations are some of the possible uses of the proposed
   technology.

AB Leishmaniasis poses a significant global health concern due to the
   absence of vaccines for humans and high infection rates in some
   countries. It is classified as a neglected tropical disease. In 2022,
   roughly 85% of global visceral leishmaniasis cases were reported in
   seven countries: Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan,
   and Sudan. Despite Brazil's advanced medical capabilities compared to
   other affected regions, certain areas still witness a significant number
   of cases, prompting increased attention from researchers and raising
   concerns within the healthcare system. This study explores the
   application of artificial intelligence algorithms, particularly machine
   learning (ML) models to predict leishmaniasis outbreaks in selected
   Brazilian cities based on accumulated cases from 2007 to 2022,
   leveraging available meteorological data to enhance model accuracy. Our
   investigation concentrated on the following cities in Brazil:
   Fortaleza/CE, Teresina/PI, and S & atilde;o Luis/MA were chosen for the
   study of visceral leishmaniasis, whereas Manaus/AM, Rio Branco/AC, and
   Macap & aacute;/AP were selected for the study of tegumentary
   leishmaniasis, encompassing both cutaneous and mucocutaneous forms.
   Several Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures were evaluated,
   including a Simple Feedforward Neural Network (SFNN), a Deep Feedforward
   Neural Network (DFNN), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent
   neural network. Additionally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM),
   specifically the Support Vector Regression (SVR), was tested. Various
   metrics were used to identify the most effective models, in which the
   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) was the primary one. The results
   highlight the significance of meteorological data as a crucial factor in
   ML models for predicting leishmaniasis outbreaks, while also emphasizing
   the importance of fine-tuning these models to achieve greater accuracy.
   Finally, data and the pseudo-code of the models are accessible through
   an open repository to encourage further studies in this area.

AB Fusariosis is an emerging mycosis caused by diverse Fusarium and allied
   fusarioid genera that are characterized by spindle-shaped macroconidia.
   These fungi possess a broad ecological distribution, causing infections
   in a wide diversity of hosts, spanning the animal and plant kingdoms.
   The spectrum of human fusariosis encompasses superficial lesions like
   keratitis and onychomycosis to invasive fungal diseases. Notable genera
   within the medically relevant fusarioid group include Neocosmospora, ,
   Fusarium s. str., , and Bisifusarium. . While Neocosmospora species
   (formerly F. solani species complex) are primary causative agents of
   human fusariosis, instances involving Fusarium s. str. and Bisifusarium
   (formerly F. dimerum species complex) have been reported. There is an
   urgent need for DNA-based markers to explore the epidemiology of these
   emerging fusarioid pathogens using molecular methods. We took advantage
   of fusarioid genomes available in NCBI (n = 20) to optimize the
   development of novel amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)
   markers by conducting indepth in silico analyses to refine their
   applicability for studies on these pathogens' genetic epidemiology.
   In-silico screening highlighted eight primer pair combinations (C1-C8)
   to be tested in vitro. . The AFLP protocol was used for genotyping 40
   medically relevant fusarioid fungi. Based on the overall scored AFLP
   markers (77-93 fragments), the values of polymorphism information
   content ( PIC = 0.3474-0.3725), marker index (MI MI = 0.0038-0.0056),
   effective multiplex ratio (E E = 26.3750- 40.4750), resolving power (Rp
   Rp = 40.1500-54.6000), discriminating power (D D = 0.7978-0.8857),
   expected heterozygosity (H H = 0.4476-0.4949), and mean heterozygosity (
   H avp = 0.0001) demonstrated the utility of these primer combinations
   for discriminating Neocosmospora, , Fusarium s. str ., and Bisifusarium
   species. Of relevance, some AFLP panels were better than others at
   studying genetic trends in Neocosmospora (#2 EcoRI-AT/MseI-TA, #3
   EcoRI-AA/MseI-TT, and #5 EcoRI-AT/MseIAG) or Fusarium s. str. (mainly #2
   EcoRI-AT/MseI-TA and #6 EcoRI-GA/MseI-TT) and Bisifusarium (#1
   EcoRI-GA/MseI-AG and #6 EcoRI-GA/MseI-TT), and these combinations will
   better resolve disease transmission routes. Our DNA fingerprint assay
   has proven effective by exhibiting rapidity, reproducibility, and high
   discriminatory capabilities, which represents a valuable asset in the
   ongoing efforts to combat fusariosis and enhance our scientific
   understanding of medically relevant Fusarium and allied fusarioid
   genera.

AB In the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder, chronic stress-related
   neuroinflammation hinders favorable prognosis and antidepressant
   response. Mitochondrial DNA may be an inflammatory trigger, after its
   release from stress-induced dysfunctional central nervous system
   mitochondria into peripheral circulation. This evidence supports the
   potential use of peripheral mitochondrial DNA as a neuroinflammatory
   biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of major depressive disorder.
   Herein, we critically review the neuroinflammation theory in major
   depressive disorder, providing compelling evidence that mitochondrial
   DNA release acts as a critical biological substrate, and that it
   constitutes the neuroinflammatory disease pathway. After its release,
   mitochondrial DNA can be carried in the exosomes and transported to
   extracellular spaces in the central nervous system and peripheral
   circulation. Detectable exosomes render encaged mitochondrial DNA
   relatively stable. This mitochondrial DNA in peripheral circulation can
   thus be directly detected in clinical practice. These characteristics
   illustrate the potential for mitochondrial DNA to serve as an innovative
   clinical biomarker and molecular treatment target for major depressive
   disorder. This review also highlights the future potential value of
   clinical applications combining mitochondrial DNA with a panel of other
   biomarkers, to improve diagnostic precision in major depressive
   disorder.

AB Irisin is a myokine that is generated by cleavage of the membrane
   protein fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) in
   response to physical exercise. Studies reveal that irisin/FNDC5 has
   neuroprotective functions against Alzheimer's disease, the most common
   form of dementia in the elderly, by improving cognitive function and
   reducing amyloid-beta and tau pathologies as well as neuroinflammation
   in cell culture or animal models of Alzheimer's disease. Although
   current and ongoing studies on irisin/FNDC5 show promising results,
   further mechanistic studies are required to clarify its potential as a
   meaningful therapeutic target for alleviating Alzheimer's disease. We
   recently found that irisin treatment reduces amyloid-beta pathology by
   increasing the activity/levels of amyloid-beta-degrading enzyme
   neprilysin secreted from astrocytes. Herein, we present an overview of
   irisin/FNDC5's protective roles and mechanisms against Alzheimer's

AB Some studies have confirmed the neuroprotective effect of remote
   ischemic conditioning against stroke. Although numerous animal
   researches have shown that the neuroprotective effect of remote ischemic
   conditioning may be related to neuroinflammation, cellular immunity,
   apoptosis, and autophagy, the exact underlying molecular mechanisms are
   unclear. This review summarizes the current status of different types of
   remote ischemic conditioning methods in animal and clinical studies and
   analyzes their commonalities and differences in neuroprotective
   mechanisms and signaling pathways. Remote ischemic conditioning has
   emerged as a potential therapeutic approach for improving stroke-induced
   brain injury owing to its simplicity, non-invasiveness, safety, and
   patient tolerability. Different forms of remote ischemic conditioning
   exhibit distinct intervention patterns, timing, and application range.
   Mechanistically, remote ischemic conditioning can exert neuroprotective
   effects by activating the Notch1/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt
   signaling pathway, improving cerebral perfusion, suppressing
   neuroinflammation, inhibiting cell apoptosis, activating autophagy, and
   promoting neural regeneration. While remote ischemic conditioning has
   shown potential in improving stroke outcomes, its full clinical
   translation has not yet been achieved.

AB The globus pallidus plays a pivotal role in the basal ganglia circuit.
   Parkinson's disease is characterized by degeneration of
   dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra, which leads to
   dopamine deficiency in the brain that subsequently manifests as various
   motor and non-motor symptoms. This review aims to summarize the
   involvement of the globus pallidus in both motor and non-motor
   manifestations of Parkinson's disease. The firing activities of
   parvalbumin neurons in the medial globus pallidus, including both the
   firing rate and pattern, exhibit strong correlations with the
   bradykinesia and rigidity associated with Parkinson's disease. Increased
   beta oscillations, which are highly correlated with bradykinesia and
   rigidity, are regulated by the lateral globus pallidus. Furthermore,
   bradykinesia and rigidity are strongly linked to the loss of
   dopaminergic projections within the cortical-basal
   ganglia-thalamocortical loop. Resting tremors are attributed to the
   transmission of pathological signals from the basal ganglia through the
   motor cortex to the cerebellum-ventral intermediate nucleus circuit. The
   cortico-striato-pallidal loop is responsible for mediating
   pallidi-associated sleep disorders. Medication and deep brain
   stimulation are the primary therapeutic strategies addressing the globus
   pallidus in Parkinson's disease. Medication is the primary treatment for
   motor symptoms in the early stages of Parkinson's disease, while deep
   brain stimulation has been clinically proven to be effective in
   alleviating symptoms in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease,
   particularly for the movement disorders caused by levodopa. Deep brain
   stimulation targeting the globus pallidus internus can improve motor
   function in patients with tremor-dominant and non-tremor-dominant
   Parkinson's disease, while deep brain stimulation targeting the globus
   pallidus externus can alter the temporal pattern of neural activity
   throughout the basal ganglia-thalamus network. Therefore, the
   composition of the globus pallidus neurons, the neurotransmitters that
   act on them, their electrical activity, and the neural circuits they
   form can guide the search for new multi-target drugs to treat
   Parkinson's disease in clinical practice. Examining the potential
   intra-nuclear and neural circuit mechanisms of deep brain stimulation
   associated with the globus pallidus can facilitate the management of
   both motor and non-motor symptoms while minimizing the side effects
   caused by deep brain stimulation.

AB Traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and
   Alzheimer's disease are three distinct neurological disorders that share
   common pathophysiological mechanisms involving neuroinflammation. One
   sequela of neuroinflammation includes the pathologic
   hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, an endogenous
   microtubule-associated protein that protects the integrity of neuronal
   cytoskeletons. Tau hyperphosphorylation results in protein misfolding
   and subsequent accumulation of tau tangles forming neurotoxic
   aggregates. These misfolded proteins are characteristic of traumatic
   brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's disease
   and can lead to downstream neuroinflammatory processes, including
   assembly and activation of the inflammasome complex. Inflammasomes refer
   to a family of multimeric protein units that, upon activation, release a
   cascade of signaling molecules resulting in caspase-induced cell death
   and inflammation mediated by the release of interleukin-1 beta cytokine.
   One specific inflammasome, the NOD-like receptor protein 3, has been
   proposed to be a key regulator of tau phosphorylation where it has been
   shown that prolonged NOD-like receptor protein 3 activation acts as a
   causal factor in pathological tau accumulation and spreading. This
   review begins by describing the epidemiology and pathophysiology of
   traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and
   Alzheimer's disease. Next, we highlight neuroinflammation as an
   overriding theme and discuss the role of the NOD-like receptor protein 3
   inflammasome in the formation of tau deposits and how such tauopathic
   entities spread throughout the brain. We then propose a novel framework
   linking traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and
   Alzheimer's disease as inflammasome-dependent pathologies that exist
   along a temporal continuum. Finally, we discuss potential therapeutic
   targets that may intercept this pathway and ultimately minimize
   long-term neurological decline.

AB Spinal cord injuries lead to significant loss of motor, sensory, and
   autonomic functions, presenting major challenges in neural regeneration.
   Achieving effective therapeutic concentrations at injury sites has been
   a slow process, partly due to the difficulty of delivering drugs
   effectively. Nanoparticles, with their targeted delivery capabilities,
   biocompatibility, and enhanced bioavailability over conventional drugs,
   are garnering attention for spinal cord injury treatment. This review
   explores the current mechanisms and shortcomings of existing treatments,
   highlighting the benefits and progress of nanoparticle-based approaches.
   We detail nanoparticle delivery methods for spinal cord injury,
   including local and intravenous injections, oral delivery, and
   biomaterial-assisted implantation, alongside strategies such as drug
   loading and surface modification. The discussion extends to how
   nanoparticles aid in reducing oxidative stress, dampening inflammation,
   fostering neural regeneration, and promoting angiogenesis. We summarize
   the use of various types of nanoparticles for treating spinal cord
   injuries, including metallic, polymeric, protein-based, inorganic
   non-metallic, and lipid nanoparticles. We also discuss the challenges
   faced, such as biosafety, effectiveness in humans, precise dosage
   control, standardization of production and characterization, immune
   responses, and targeted delivery in vivo. Additionally, we explore
   future directions, such as improving biosafety, standardizing
   manufacturing and characterization processes, and advancing human
   trials. Nanoparticles have shown considerable progress in targeted
   delivery and enhancing treatment efficacy for spinal cord injuries,
   presenting significant potential for clinical use and drug development.

AB Abnormal expression of microRNAs is connected to brain development and
   disease and could provide novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and
   prognosis of bipolar disorder. We performed a PubMed search for microRNA
   biomarkers in bipolar disorder and found 18 original research articles
   on studies performed with human patients and published from January 2011
   to June 2023. These studies included microRNA profiling in blood- and
   brain-based materials. From the studies that had validated the
   preliminary findings, potential candidate biomarkers for bipolar
   disorder in adults could be miR-140-3p, -30d-5p, -330-5p, -378a-5p,
   -21-3p, -330-3p, -345-5p in whole blood, miR-19b-3p, -1180-3p, -125a-5p,
   let-7e-5p in blood plasma, and miR-7-5p, -23b-5p, -142-3p, -221-5p,
   -370-3p in the blood serum. Two of the studies had investigated the
   changes in microRNA expression of patients with bipolar disorder
   receiving treatment. One showed a significant increase in plasma miR-134
   compared to baseline after 4 weeks of treatment which included typical
   antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines. The other
   study had assessed the effects of prescribed medications which included
   neurotransmitter receptor-site binders (drug class B) and sedatives,
   hypnotics, anticonvulsants, and analgesics (drug class C) on microRNA
   results. The combined effects of the two drug classes increased the
   significance of the results for miR-219 and -29c with miR-30e-3p and
   -526b* acquiring significance. MicroRNAs were tested to see if they
   could serve as biomarkers of bipolar disorder at different clinical
   states of mania, depression, and euthymia. One study showed that
   upregulation in whole blood of miR-9-5p, -29a-3p, -106a-5p, -106b-5p,
   -107, -125a-3p, -125b-5p and of miR-107, -125a-3p occurred in manic and
   euthymic patients compared to controls, respectively, and that
   upregulation of miR-106a-5p, -107 was found for manic compared to
   euthymic patients. In two other studies using blood plasma,
   downregulation of miR-134 was observed in manic patients compared to
   controls, and dysregulation of miR-134, -152, -607, -633, -652, -155
   occurred in euthymic patients compared to controls. Finally, microRNAs
   such as miR-34a, -34b, -34c, -137, and -140-3p, -21-3p, -30d-5p,
   -330-5p, -378a-5p, -134, -19b-3p were shown to have diagnostic potential
   in distinguishing bipolar disorder patients from schizophrenia or major
   depressive disorder patients, respectively. Further studies are
   warranted with adolescents and young adults having bipolar disorder and
   consideration should be given to using animal models of the disorder to
   investigate the effects of suppressing or overexpressing specific
   microRNAs.

AB Degenerative cervical myelopathy is a common cause of spinal cord
   injury, with longer symptom duration and higher myelopathy severity
   indicating a worse prognosis. While numerous studies have investigated
   serological biomarkers for acute spinal cord injury, few studies have
   explored such biomarkers for diagnosing degenerative cervical
   myelopathy. This study involved 30 patients with degenerative cervical
   myelopathy (51.3 +/- 7.3 years old, 12 women and 18 men), seven healthy
   controls (25.7 +/- 1.7 years old, one woman and six men), and nine
   patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (51.9 +/- 8.6 years
   old, three women and six men). Analysis of blood samples from the three
   groups showed clear differences in transcriptomic characteristics.
   Enrichment analysis identified 128 differentially expressed genes that
   were enriched in patients with neurological disabilities. Using least
   absolute shrinkage and selection operator analysis, we constructed a
   five-gene model (TBCD, TPM2, PNKD, EIF4G2, and AP5Z1) to diagnose
   degenerative cervical myelopathy with an accuracy of 93.5%. One-gene
   models (TCAP and SDHA) identified mild and severe degenerative cervical
   myelopathy with accuracies of 83.3% and 76.7%, respectively. Signatures
   of two immune cell types (memory B cells and memory-activated CD4+ T
   cells) predicted levels of lesions in degenerative cervical myelopathy
   with 80% accuracy. Our results suggest that peripheral blood RNA
   biomarkers could be used to predict lesion severity in degenerative
   cervical myelopathy.

AB Microfluidic devices are used for various applications in biology and
   medicine. From on-chip modelling of human organs for drug screening and
   fast and straightforward point-of-care (POC) detection of diseases to
   sensitive biochemical analysis, these devices can be custom-engineered
   using low-cost techniques. The microchannel interface is essential for
   these applications, as it is the interface of immobilised biomolecules
   that promote cell capture, attachment and proliferation, sense analytes
   and metabolites or provide enzymatic reaction readouts. However, common
   microfluidic materials do not facilitate the stable immobilisation of
   biomolecules required for relevant applications, making interfacial
   engineering necessary to attach biomolecules to the microfluidic
   surfaces. Interfacial engineering is performed through various
   immobilisation mechanisms and surface treatment techniques, which
   suitably modify the surface properties like chemistry and energy to
   obtain robust biomolecule immobilisation and long-term storage stability
   suitable for the final application. In this review, we provide an
   overview of the status of interfacial engineering in microfluidic
   devices, covering applications, the role of biomolecules, their
   immobilisation pathways and the influence of microfluidic materials. We
   then propose treatment techniques to optimise performance for various
   biological and medical applications and highlight future areas of
   development.

AB In medical and biomedical fields, enzyme-mimetic nanomaterials have
   garnered significant interest as efficacious signal enhancers for
   biocatalyst-linked immunosorbent assays (BLISA). Despite the burgeoning
   enthusiasm, engineering artificial biocatalysts that exhibit both
   exceptional catalytic proficiency and pronounced colorimetric signal
   output remains a formidable challenge. Inspired by the heme structures
   and biocatalytic activities of horseradish peroxidase, we introduce the
   synthesis of vanadium single-atoms (SAV) coordinated artificial
   peroxidases as BLISA for highly sensitive and selective carcinoembryonic
   antigen (CEA) immunoassay. Our synthesized SAV exhibits peroxidase
   (POD)-like activity that is both efficacious and highly specific,
   surpassing the performance of many other single-atom-structured
   materials. The SAV-linked immunoassay demonstrates an ultrasensitive
   response to the target antigen (CEA), with a linear detection range
   spanning 0.03-10ng/mL and an impressively low detection limit of
   0.335ng/mL. This straightforward and robust immunoassay technique not
   only achieves superior signal amplification compared to traditional
   natural enzymes but also boasts high precision, commendable
   reproducibility, and remarkable specificity, aligning closely with
   conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for CEA detection in
   serum samples. This study offers a blueprint for designing artificial
   peroxidase-based colorimetric nanosystems, promoting the evolution of
   ultrasensitive BLISA applications for the early diagnosis and
   intervention of cancer.

AB The healthcare demand for online medical counseling has increased.
   Management of chronic conditions through Internet hospitals and online
   platforms has shifted from cure-centered approaches to service-oriented
   counseling. Previous studies have given less attention to the combined
   behavioral and perceived determinants that influence subsequent
   counseling, particularly in terms of types and timing. Our research
   identifies key determinants including sequential intertemporal
   behavioral patterns of return visits, perceived current counseling
   intensity measured by perceived usefulness and emotional attitudes, as
   well as diagnosis-oriented clustering enhancements suitable for chronic
   conditions specialties. The Diagnosis-specific Intervalscaled
   Perception-sensitive (DIPs) framework integrates nearly 380 thousand
   real dialogues from Chinese electronic healthcare records (CEHRs) and
   auxiliary information. Performance evaluations using the receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the precision-recall curve
   (PRC) yield high scores of 0.95 Area Under the ROC Curve (AUROC) and
   0.72 Area Under the PrecisionRecall Curve (AUPRC), which is significant
   in unbalanced multi-classification tasks offering a solution to chronic
   online counseling behavioral propensity estimation and widespread
   adoption in real-world settings. DIPs framework's credible quantitative
   interpretability provides insights into prioritizing behavioral and
   perceptual impacts over computational features in counseling propensity
   predictions. Platforms and physicians can facilitate targeted
   interventions that align patients' expectations with the sustainable
   delivery of on-demand services in chronic conditions management.

AB In the United States, about 5% of pediatric Emergency Department (ED)
   visits involve mental and behavioral health (MBH) emergencies, and EDs
   are often ill-equipped to provide timely, appropriate care, leading to
   prolonged stays and increased risks of trauma and harm for these
   children and their families. This study investigated technological
   barriers affecting safe and effective pediatric mental and behavioral
   healthcare in emergency departments through observational studies and
   semi-structured interviews with 55 medical professionals across four ED
   settings: pediatric MBH unit, pediatric ED, and adult ED. A total of 12
   barrier themes were identified through the thematic analysis of the
   interviews relating to technology use that impacts the care of pediatric
   MBH patients. The major themes include issues due to limited electronic
   medical record data management, ineffective communication in the ED, and
   usability issues with ED technologies. Other concerns included
   inadequate infrastructure, absence of streamlined processes, unsafe and
   inefficient integration of technology, and lack of training. Challenges
   stemming from patients' reluctance to accept telepsychiatry further
   complicate providing effective care in these settings. Future research
   needs to focus on designing systems and solutions to eliminate the
   barriers, thereby supporting the caregiving process of pediatric MBH in
   EDs.

AB In spite of the hypoxia tumor microenvironment, an efficacious treatment
   with minimal invasiveness is highly desirable. Among common cellular
   organelles, mitochondria is a common target for inductive cellular
   apoptosis and tumor proliferation inhibition. Nevertheless, tumor
   hypoxic circumstances always give rise to poor therapeutic efficiency
   and instead lead to lesion recurrence and unsatisfactory prognosis.
   Herein, a home-tailored pyroelectric nanocomposites of
   BTO@PDA-FA-DOX-EGCG have been developed via a layer-by-layer synthesis
   to serve a cutting-edge tumor treatment with specific
   mitochondria-targeting, hypoxia-relieving, chemophotodynamic performance
   and high anti-tumor efficacy. In particular, this therapeutic modality
   is featured as drug-device-field integration (DDFI) by combining
   chemo-drugs of DOX and EGCG, a commercially available medical laser and
   physical pyroelectric fields, which synergistically contributed to
   continuing ROS production and consequently cell apoptosis and tumor
   growth inhibition. Meanwhile, an anti-tumor mechanism of immune
   actuation and mitochondria dysfunction was elucidated by analyzing
   specific biomarkers of mitochondria complexes and MMPs, and therefore
   this research opened up a potential pathway for advanced tumor treatment
   by incorporating nanocomposites, medical devices and physical fields in

AB Medical image segmentation presents a formidable challenge, compounded
   by the scarcity of annotated data in numerous datasets. Semi-supervised
   methods offer viable solutions to mitigate that, while the image
   generation capability of diffusion models has shown potential in
   capturing semantically meaningful information. This paper introduces
   Multi-Consistency for semi-supervised medical image Segmentation via
   Diffusion Models (MCSD). We propose a Diffusion-based Feature-guided
   Module (DFM) that extracts features from pre-trained diffusion models
   and uses multi-scale features to guide multi-consistency segmentation
   networks. Additionally, we introduce the Dual-branch Image Consistency
   (DIC) strategy, which performs multi-consistency learning by generating
   two independent strong augmented images and optimizing the network by
   encouraging consistency between strong and weak inputs at multiple
   levels of features and images. Our method outperforms current
   approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness in semi-supervised medical
   image segmentation through experimental results for various labeled data
   ratios. Furthermore, this work points out the potentiality of diffusion
   models in semi-supervised medical image segmentation and offers
   suggestions for improving their use in medical imaging tasks. The code

AB The second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging has attracted
   widespread attention from researchers due to its powerful advantage of
   assisting doctors in real-time tumor removal during surgery. Light has
   different penetration capabilities in different bands. Although NIR-IIb
   window (1,500-1,700 nm) imaging is clearer than NIR-IIa window
   (1,000-1,300 nm), there are no effective molecular probes for NIR-IIb
   clinical transformation. NIR-II images are rich in variety, including
   animals, tissues, etc., and the huge differences in structure also bring
   difficulties to image enhancement. In order to solve the above problems,
   we propose a universal NIRII fluorescence image enhancement model based
   on arbitrary style transfer, and simultaneously achieve the quality
   enhancement of multiple types of NIR-IIa fluorescence images. The goal
   of this model design is to completely preserve the important information
   of the original image to prevent artifacts and meet the high demand for
   real-time imaging during NIR-II surgery. To this end, we design a fusion
   network based on the calculation method of square-square root-sign
   assignment, in which the content information of NIR-IIa is integrated
   into the style representation of NIR-IIb to increase the maintenance of
   the original content structure, so that the stylized feature map tends
   to show the content. In addition, we propose an attention matching loss,
   which extracts key structural information through the attention
   mechanism and maintains the structure of the enhanced image consistent
   with the original image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
   proposed model has a great advantage in maintaining the original content
   information, with the SSIM of 0.625 and the content loss of 0.279
   compared to the original images. In addition, the quality of enhanced
   images is satisfactory, with the PSNR of 31.20 and the SSIM of 0.501
   compared to the real images.

AB Overuse of the eyes is prone to visual fatigue, which mainly manifests
   itself in conditions such as eye dryness, blurred vision as well as eye
   pain, and eye soreness. Visual fatigue occurs mainly due to various
   adverse damages arising on the retina, such as oxidative stress,
   inflammatory damage, and apoptosis. Also, aging of the eye is one of the
   causes of visual fatigue. Data shows that the number of people suffering
   from visual fatigue is increasing year by year and involves a wide range
   of people, especially those who use computers for long periods of time,
   read and study, and use sophisticated instruments related to
   ophthalmology (e.g., microscopes). Current research has confirmed that,
   while changing one's bad eye habits, supplementing with appropriate
   nutrients or foods can significantly reduce visual fatigue, such as
   lutein, zeaxanthin, anthocyanins, taurine, and other foods. The study
   shows that vitamins and minerals, as essential nutrients and
   antioxidants, are involved in various physiological processes in the
   body and are of great importance and necessity for eye health. However,
   the frequency of vitamins and minerals applied to the development of
   functional foods for the relief of visual fatigue is currently low.
   Therefore, this paper provides a detailed overview of the absorption
   mechanisms of vitamins and minerals in the human body and reviews the
   potential role of vitamins and minerals applied to the function of
   relieving visual fatigue. It also suggests the shortcomings of the
   current research on vitamins and minerals and hopes to provide some
   references and inspirations for the research and development of
   functional foods in which vitamins and minerals are applied to assist in
   the alleviation of visual fatigue.

AB Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease. It is not
   curable and treatment revolves around controlling the symptoms. The most
   preferable approach is medicating with levodopa drug. One of the major
   concerns in treating with this drug is its conversion to dopamine within
   the gut and 1%-10% of dopamine becomes available to the brain, thus
   compromising the effectiveness of the treatment. Other dominant concerns
   are y-amino butyric acid (GABA) collapse and serotonergic dysfunction
   that leads to secondary symptoms. To counter-balance its appalling
   repercussions reversal of gut bacterial dysbiosis and gut modulation by
   supportive bacteria is the new uproar, uncovering potent applications.
   In this study, gut bacteria were focused on having the ability to
   overcome the drug interference possibility. Samples were collected from
   PD patients, prone to PD, and healthy individuals for isolation of gut
   bacteria and were screened for criteria like tyrosine decarboxylase,
   GABA, short chain fatty acids (SCPAs), and serotonin production. Thin
   layer chromatography (TLC), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
   (FTIR), and spectrophotometric analysis were used to test bacteria for
   the production of GABA and serotonin. A total of 655 isolates were
   screened and 23 isolates were further evaluated for their probiotic
   properties. Out of which 6 isolates namely HFS 2.1 TM, HFS 10.2 TM, FS
   9.2 SA, HFS 6.2 NA. HFS 11.1 TM, and HFS 11.1 PDA were identified by 165
   RNA sequencing and were screened positive to be prospective psychobiotic

AB Current therapeutic strategies for ischemic stroke fall short of the
   desired objective of neurological functional recovery. Therefore, there
   is an urgent need to develop new methods for the treatment of this
   condition. Exosomes are natural cell-derived vesicles that mediate
   signal transduction between cells under physiological and pathological
   conditions. They have low immunogenicity, good stability, high delivery
   efficiency, and the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. These
   physiological properties of exosomes have the potential to lead to new
   breakthroughs in the treatment of ischemic stroke. The rapid development
   of nanotechnology has advanced the application of engineered exosomes,
   which can effectively improve targeting ability, enhance therapeutic
   efficacy, and minimize the dosages needed. Advances in technology have
   also driven clinical translational research on exosomes. In this review,
   we describe the therapeutic effects of exosomes and their positive roles
   in current treatment strategies for ischemic stroke, including their
   anti-inflammation, anti-apoptosis, autophagy-regulation, angiogenesis,
   neurogenesis, and glial scar formation reduction effects. However, it is
   worth noting that, despite their significant therapeutic potential,
   there remains a dearth of standardized characterization methods and
   efficient isolation techniques capable of producing highly purified
   exosomes. Future optimization strategies should prioritize the
   exploration of suitable isolation techniques and the establishment of
   unified workflows to effectively harness exosomes for diagnostic or
   therapeutic applications in ischemic stroke. Ultimately, our review aims
   to summarize our understanding of exosome-based treatment prospects in
   ischemic stroke and foster innovative ideas for the development of
   exosome-based therapies.

AB Current treatments for epilepsy can only manage the symptoms of the
   condition but cannot alter the initial onset or halt the progression of
   the disease. Consequently, it is crucial to identify drugs that can
   target novel cellular and molecular mechanisms and mechanisms of action.
   Increasing evidence suggests that axon guidance molecules play a role in
   the structural and functional modifications of neural networks and that
   the dysregulation of these molecules is associated with epilepsy
   susceptibility. In this review, we discuss the essential role of axon
   guidance molecules in neuronal activity in patients with epilepsy as
   well as the impact of these molecules on synaptic plasticity and brain
   tissue remodeling. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between axon
   guidance molecules and neuroinflammation, as well as the structural
   changes in specific brain regions that contribute to the development of
   epilepsy. Ample evidence indicates that axon guidance molecules,
   including semaphorins and ephrins, play a fundamental role in guiding
   axon growth and the establishment of synaptic connections. Deviations in
   their expression or function can disrupt neuronal connections,
   ultimately leading to epileptic seizures. The remodeling of neural
   networks is a significant characteristic of epilepsy, with axon guidance
   molecules playing a role in the dynamic reorganization of neural
   circuits. This, in turn, affects synapse formation and elimination.
   Dysregulation of these molecules can upset the delicate balance between
   excitation and inhibition within a neural network, thereby increasing
   the risk of overexcitation and the development of epilepsy. Inflammatory
   signals can regulate the expression and function of axon guidance
   molecules, thus influencing axonal growth, axon orientation, and
   synaptic plasticity. The dysregulation of neuroinflammation can
   intensify neuronal dysfunction and contribute to the occurrence of
   epilepsy. This review delves into the mechanisms associated with the
   pathogenicity of axon guidance molecules in epilepsy, offering a
   valuable reference for the exploration of therapeutic targets and
   presenting a fresh perspective on treatment strategies for this
   condition.

AB The central nervous system, information integration center of the body,
   is mainly composed of neurons and glial cells. The neuron is one of the
   most basic and important structural and functional units of the central
   nervous system, with sensory stimulation and excitation conduction
   functions. Astrocytes and microglia belong to the glial cell family,
   which is the main source of cytokines and represents the main defense
   system of the central nervous system. Nerve cells undergo
   neurotransmission or gliotransmission, which regulates neuronal activity
   via the ion channels, receptors, or transporters expressed on nerve cell
   membranes. Ion channels, composed of large transmembrane proteins, play
   crucial roles in maintaining nerve cell homeostasis. These channels are
   also important for control of the membrane potential and in the
   secretion of neurotransmitters. A variety of cellular functions and life
   activities, including functional regulation of the central nervous
   system, the generation and conduction of nerve excitation, the
   occurrence of receptor potential, heart pulsation, smooth muscle
   peristalsis, skeletal muscle contraction, and hormone secretion, are
   closely related to ion channels associated with passive transmembrane
   transport. Two types of ion channels in the central nervous system,
   potassium channels and calcium channels, are closely related to various
   neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's
   disease, and epilepsy. Accordingly, various drugs that can affect these
   ion channels have been explored deeply to provide new directions for the
   treatment of these neurological disorders. In this review, we focus on
   the functions of potassium and calcium ion channels in different nerve
   cells and their involvement in neurological disorders such as
   Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, depression, epilepsy, autism,
   and rare disorders. We also describe several clinical drugs that target
   potassium or calcium channels in nerve cells and could be used to treat
   these disorders. We concluded that there are few clinical drugs that can
   improve the pathology these diseases by acting on potassium or calcium
   ions. Although a few novel ion-channel-specific modulators have been
   discovered, meaningful therapies have largely not yet been realized. The
   lack of target-specific drugs, their requirement to cross the
   blood-brain barrier, and their exact underlying mechanisms all need
   further attention. This review aims to explain the urgent problems that
   need research progress and provide comprehensive information aiming to
   arouse the research community's interest in the development of ion
   channel-targeting drugs and the identification of new therapeutic
   targets for that can increase the cure rate of nervous system diseases
   and reduce the occurrence of adverse reactions in other systems.

AB The primary mechanism of secondary injury after cerebral ischemia may be
   the brain inflammation that emerges after an ischemic stroke, which
   promotes neuronal death and inhibits nerve tissue regeneration. As the
   first immune cells to be activated after an ischemic stroke, microglia
   play an important immunomodulatory role in the progression of the
   condition. After an ischemic stroke, peripheral blood immune cells
   (mainly T cells) are recruited to the central nervous system by
   chemokines secreted by immune cells in the brain, where they interact
   with central nervous system cells (mainly microglia) to trigger a
   secondary neuroimmune response. This review summarizes the interactions
   between T cells and microglia in the immune-inflammatory processes of
   ischemic stroke. We found that, during ischemic stroke, T cells and
   microglia demonstrate a more pronounced synergistic effect. Th1, Th17,
   and M1 microglia can co-secrete pro-inflammatory factors, such as
   interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-1 beta,
   to promote neuroinflammation and exacerbate brain injury. Th2, Treg, and
   M2 microglia jointly secrete anti-inflammatory factors, such as
   interleukin-4, interleukin-10, and transforming growth factor-beta, to
   inhibit the progression of neuroinflammation, as well as growth factors
   such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor to promote nerve regeneration
   and repair brain injury. Immune interactions between microglia and T
   cells influence the direction of the subsequent neuroinflammation, which
   in turn determines the prognosis of ischemic stroke patients. Clinical
   trials have been conducted on the ways to modulate the interactions
   between T cells and microglia toward anti-inflammatory communication
   using the immunosuppressant fingolimod or overdosing with Treg cells to
   promote neural tissue repair and reduce the damage caused by ischemic
   stroke. However, such studies have been relatively infrequent, and
   clinical experience is still insufficient. In summary, in ischemic
   stroke, T cell subsets and activated microglia act synergistically to
   regulate inflammatory progression, mainly by secreting inflammatory
   factors. In the future, a key research direction for ischemic stroke
   treatment could be rooted in the enhancement of anti-inflammatory factor
   secretion by promoting the generation of Th2 and Treg cells, along with
   the activation of M2-type microglia. These approaches may alleviate
   neuroinflammation and facilitate the repair of neural tissues.

AB Spinal cord injuries have profound detrimental effects on individuals,
   regardless of whether they are caused by trauma or non-traumatic events.
   The compromised regeneration of the spinal cord is primarily attributed
   to damaged neurons, inhibitory molecules, dysfunctional immune response,
   and glial scarring. Unfortunately, currently, there are no effective
   treatments available that can fully repair the spinal cord and improve
   functional outcomes. Nevertheless, numerous pre-clinical approaches have
   been studied for spinal cord injury recovery, including using
   biomaterials, cells, drugs, or technological-based strategies.
   Combinatorial treatments, which target various aspects of spinal cord
   injury pathophysiology, have been extensively tested in the last decade.
   These approaches aim to synergistically enhance repair processes by
   addressing various obstacles faced during spinal cord regeneration.
   Thus, this review intends to provide scientists and clinicians with an
   overview of pre-clinical combinatorial approaches that have been
   developed toward the solution of spinal cord regeneration as well as
   update the current knowledge about spinal cord injury pathophysiology
   with an emphasis on the current clinical management.

AB Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
   cognitive dysfunction and behavioral abnormalities. Neuroinflammatory
   plaques formed through the extracellular deposition of amyloid-beta
   proteins, as well as neurofibrillary tangles formed by the intracellular
   deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, comprise two typical
   pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. Besides symptomatic
   treatment, there are no effective therapies for delaying Alzheimer's
   disease progression. MicroRNAs (miR) are small, non-coding RNAs that
   negatively regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and
   translational levels and play important roles in multiple physiological
   and pathological processes. Indeed, miR-146a, a NF-kappa B-regulated
   gene, has been extensively implicated in the development of Alzheimer's
   disease through several pathways. Research has demonstrated substantial
   dysregulation of miR-146a both during the initial phases and throughout
   the progression of this disorder. MiR-146a is believed to reduce
   amyloid-beta deposition and tau protein hyperphosphorylation through the
   TLR/IRAK1/TRAF6 pathway; however, there is also evidence supporting that
   it can promote these processes through many other pathways, thus
   exacerbating the pathological manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. It
   has been widely reported that miR-146a mediates synaptic dysfunction,
   mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal death by targeting mRNAs
   encoding synaptic-related proteins, mitochondrial-related proteins, and
   membrane proteins, as well as other mRNAs. Regarding the impact on glial
   cells, miR-146a also exhibits differential effects. On one hand, it
   causes widespread and sustained inflammation through certain pathways,
   while on the other hand, it can reverse the polarization of astrocytes
   and microglia, alleviate neuroinflammation, and promote oligodendrocyte
   progenitor cell differentiation, thus maintaining the normal function of
   the myelin sheath and exerting a protective effect on neurons. In this
   review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the involvement of
   miR-146a in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. We aim to elucidate
   the relationship between miR-146a and the key pathological
   manifestations of Alzheimer's disease, such as amyloid-beta deposition,
   tau protein hyperphosphorylation, neuronal death, mitochondrial
   dysfunction, synaptic dysfunction, and glial cell dysfunction, as well
   as summarize recent relevant studies that have highlighted the potential
   of miR-146a as a clinical diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for
   Alzheimer's disease.

AB Spinal cord injury remains a major cause of disability in young adults,
   and beyond acute decompression and rehabilitation, there are no
   pharmacological treatments to limit the progression of injury and
   optimize recovery in this population. Following the thorough
   investigation of the complement system in triggering and propagating
   cerebral neuroinflammation, a similar role for complement in spinal
   neuroinflammation is a focus of ongoing research. In this work, we
   survey the current literature investigating the role of complement in
   spinal cord injury including the sources of complement proteins,
   triggers of complement activation, and role of effector functions in the
   pathology. We study relevant data demonstrating the different triggers
   of complement activation after spinal cord injury including direct
   binding to cellular debris, and or activation via antibody binding to
   damage-associated molecular patterns. Several effector functions of
   complement have been implicated in spinal cord injury, and we critically
   evaluate recent studies on the dual role of complement anaphylatoxins in
   spinal cord injury while emphasizing the lack of pathophysiological
   understanding of the role of opsonins in spinal cord injury. Following
   this pathophysiological review, we systematically review the different
   translational approaches used in preclinical models of spinal cord
   injury and discuss the challenges for future translation into human
   subjects. This review emphasizes the need for future studies to dissect
   the roles of different complement pathways in the pathology of spinal
   cord injury, to evaluate the phases of involvement of opsonins and
   anaphylatoxins, and to study the role of complement in white matter
   degeneration and regeneration using translational strategies to
   supplement genetic models.

AB Spinal cord injury is an intractable traumatic injury. The most common
   hurdles faced during spinal cord injury are failure of axonal regrowth
   and reconnection to target sites. These also tend to be the most
   challenging issues in spinal cord injury. As spinal cord injury
   progresses to the chronic phase, lost motor and sensory functions are
   not recovered. Several reasons may be attributed to the failure of
   recovery from chronic spinal cord injury. These include factors that
   inhibit axonal growth such as activated astrocytes, chondroitin sulfate
   proteoglycan, myelin-associated proteins, inflammatory microglia, and
   fibroblasts that accumulate at lesion sites. Skeletal muscle atrophy due
   to denervation is another chronic and detrimental spinal cord
   injury-specific condition. Although several intervention strategies
   based on multiple outlooks have been attempted for treating spinal cord
   injury, few approaches have been successful. To treat chronic spinal
   cord injury, neural cells or tissue substitutes may need to be supplied
   in the cavity area to enable possible axonal growth. Additionally,
   stimulating axonal growth activity by extrinsic factors is extremely
   important and essential for maintaining the remaining host neurons and
   transplanted neurons. This review focuses on pharmacotherapeutic
   approaches using small compounds and proteins to enable axonal growth in
   chronic spinal cord injury. This review presents some of these
   candidates that have shown promising outcomes in basic research (in vivo
   animal studies) and clinical trials: AA-NgR(310)ecto-Fc (AXER-204),
   fasudil, phosphatase and tensin homolog protein antagonist peptide 4,
   chondroitinase ABC, intracellular sigma peptide, (-)-epigallocatechin
   gallate, matrine, acteoside, pyrvate kinase M2, diosgenin,
   granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and fampridine-sustained release.
   Although the current situation suggests that drug-based therapies to
   recover function in chronic spinal cord injury are limited, potential
   candidates have been identified through basic research, and these
   candidates may be subjects of clinical studies in the future. Moreover,
   cocktail therapy comprising drugs with varied underlying mechanisms may
   be effective in treating the refractory status of chronic spinal cord
   injury.

AB Schwann cell transplantation is considered one of the most promising
   cell-based therapy to repair injured spinal cord due to its unique
   growth-promoting and myelin-forming properties. A the Food and Drug
   Administration-approved Phase I clinical trial has been conducted to
   evaluate the safety of transplanted human autologous Schwann cells to
   treat patients with spinal cord injury. A major challenge for Schwann
   cell transplantation is that grafted Schwann cells are confined within
   the lesion cavity, and they do not migrate into the host environment due
   to the inhibitory barrier formed by injury-induced glial scar, thus
   limiting axonal reentry into the host spinal cord. Here we introduce a
   combinatorial strategy by suppressing the inhibitory extracellular
   environment with injection of lentivirus-mediated transfection of
   chondroitinase ABC gene at the rostral and caudal borders of the lesion
   site and simultaneously leveraging the repair capacity of transplanted
   Schwann cells in adult rats following a mid-thoracic contusive spinal
   cord injury. We report that when the glial scar was degraded by
   chondroitinase ABC at the rostral and caudal lesion borders, Schwann
   cells migrated for considerable distances in both rostral and caudal
   directions. Such Schwann cell migration led to enhanced axonal regrowth,
   including the serotonergic and dopaminergic axons originating from
   supraspinal regions, and promoted recovery of locomotor and urinary
   bladder functions. Importantly, the Schwann cell survival and axonal
   regrowth persisted up to 6 months after the injury, even when treatment
   was delayed for 3 months to mimic chronic spinal cord injury. These
   findings collectively show promising evidence for a combinatorial
   strategy with chondroitinase ABC and Schwann cells in promoting
   remodeling and recovery of function following spinal cord injury.

AB Noise-induced hearing loss is the primary non-genetic factor
   contributing to auditory dysfunction. However, there are currently no
   effective pharmacological interventions for patients with noise-induced
   hearing loss. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the
   lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor-tranylcypromine is an
   otoprotective agent that could be used to treat noise-induced hearing
   loss, and elucidate its underlying regulatory mechanisms. We established
   a mouse model of permanent threshold shift hearing loss by exposing the
   mice to white broadband noise at a sound pressure level of 120 dB for 4
   hours. We found that tranylcypromine treatment led to the upregulation
   of Sestrin2 (SESN2) and activation of the autophagy markers light chain
   3B and lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 in the cochleae of
   mice treated with tranylcypromine. The noise exposure group treated with
   tranylcypromine showed significantly lower average auditory brainstem
   response hearing thresholds at click, 4, 8, and 16 kHz frequencies
   compared with the noise exposure group treated with saline. These
   findings indicate that tranylcypromine treatment resulted in increased
   SESN2, light chain 3B, and lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 1
   expression after noise exposure, leading to a reduction in levels of
   4-hydroxynonenal and cleaved caspase-3, thereby reducing noise-induced
   hair cell loss. Additionally, immunoblot analysis demonstrated that
   treatment with tranylcypromine upregulated SESN2 expression via the
   autophagy pathway. Tranylcypromine treatment also reduced the production
   of NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3)
   production. In conclusion, our results showed that tranylcypromine
   treatment ameliorated cochlear inflammation by promoting the expression
   of SESN2, which induced autophagy, thereby restricting NLRP3-related
   inflammasome signaling, alleviating cochlear hair cell loss, and
   protecting hearing function. These findings suggest that inhibiting
   lysine-specific demethylase 1 is a potential therapeutic strategy for
   preventing hair cell loss and noise-induced hearing loss.

AB Distinct brain remodeling has been found after different nerve
   reconstruction strategies, including motor representation of the
   affected limb. However, differences among reconstruction strategies at
   the brain network level have not been elucidated. This study aimed to
   explore intra-network changes related to altered peripheral neural
   pathways after different nerve reconstruction surgeries, including nerve
   repair, end-to-end nerve transfer, and end-to-side nerve transfer.
   Sprague-Dawley rats underwent complete left brachial plexus transection
   and were divided into four equal groups of eight: no nerve repair,
   grafted nerve repair, phrenic nerve end-to-end transfer, and end-to-side
   transfer with a graft sutured to the anterior upper trunk. Resting-state
   brain functional magnetic resonance imaging was obtained 7 months after
   surgery. The independent component analysis algorithm was utilized to
   identify group-level network components of interest and extract
   resting-state functional connectivity values of each voxel within the
   component. Alterations in intra-network resting-state functional
   connectivity were compared among the groups. Target muscle reinnervation
   was assessed by behavioral observation (elbow flexion) and
   electromyography. The results showed that alterations in the
   sensorimotor and interoception networks were mostly related to changes
   in the peripheral neural pathway. Nerve repair was related to enhanced
   connectivity within the sensorimotor network, while end-to-side nerve
   transfer might be more beneficial for restoring control over the
   affected limb by the original motor representation. The
   thalamic-cortical pathway was enhanced within the interoception network
   after nerve repair and end-to-end nerve transfer. Brain areas related to
   cognition and emotion were enhanced after end-to-side nerve transfer.
   Our study revealed important brain networks related to different nerve
   reconstructions. These networks may be potential targets for enhancing
   motor recovery.

AB Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a rare neurodegenerative disease
   characterized by the involvement of both upper and lower motor neurons.
   Early bilateral limb involvement significantly affects patients' daily
   lives and may lead them to be confined to bed. However, the effect of
   upper and lower motor neuron impairment and other risk factors on
   bilateral limb involvement is unclear. To address this issue, we
   retrospectively collected data from 586 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
   patients with limb onset diagnosed at Peking University Third Hospital
   between January 2020 and May 2022. A univariate analysis revealed no
   significant differences in the time intervals of spread in different
   directions between individuals with upper motor neuron-dominant
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and those with classic amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis. We used causal directed acyclic graphs for risk factor
   determination and Cox proportional hazards models to investigate the
   association between the duration of bilateral limb involvement and
   clinical baseline characteristics in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
   patients. Multiple factor analyses revealed that higher upper motor
   neuron scores (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] =
   1.01-1.09, P = 0.018), onset in the left limb (HR = 0.72, 95% CI =
   0.58-0.89, P = 0.002), and a horizontal pattern of progression (HR =
   0.46, 95% CI = 0.37-0.58, P < 0.001) were risk factors for a shorter
   interval until bilateral limb involvement. The results demonstrated that
   a greater degree of upper motor neuron involvement might cause
   contralateral limb involvement to progress more quickly in limb-onset
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. These findings may improve the
   management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients with limb onset and
   the prediction of patient prognosis.

AB Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is a crucial neurotrophic factor that
   plays a significant role in brain health. Although the vast majority of
   meta-analyses have confirmed that exercise interventions can increase
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in children and adolescents,
   the effects of specific types of exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor levels are still controversial. To address this issue, we used
   meta-analytic methods to quantitatively evaluate, analyze, and integrate
   relevant studies. Our goals were to formulate general conclusions
   regarding the use of exercise interventions, explore the physiological
   mechanisms by which exercise improves brain health and cognitive ability
   in children and adolescents, and provide a reliable foundation for
   follow-up research. We used the PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct,
   Springer, Wiley Online Library, Weipu, Wanfang, and China National
   Knowledge Infrastructure databases to search for randomized controlled
   trials examining the influences of exercise interventions on
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in children and adolescents.
   The extracted data were analyzed using ReviewManager 5.3. According to
   the inclusion criteria, we assessed randomized controlled trials in
   which the samples were mainly children and adolescents, and the outcome
   indicators were measured before and after the intervention. We excluded
   animal experiments, studies that lacked a control group, and those that
   did not report quantitative results. The mean difference (MD; before
   versus after intervention) was used to evaluate the effect of exercise
   on brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in children and adolescents.
   Overall, 531 participants (60 children and 471 adolescents, 10.9-16.1
   years) were included from 13 randomized controlled trials. Heterogeneity
   was evaluated using the Q statistic and I-2 test provided by
   ReviewManager software. The meta-analysis showed that there was no
   heterogeneity among the studies (P = 0.67, I-2 = 0.00%). The combined
   effect of the interventions was significant (MD = 2.88, 95% CI:
   1.53-4.22, P < 0.0001), indicating that the brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor levels of the children and adolescents in the exercise group were
   significantly higher than those in the control group. In conclusion,
   different types of exercise interventions significantly increased
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in children and adolescents.
   However, because of the small sample size of this meta-analysis, more
   high-quality research is needed to verify our conclusions. This
   meta-analysis was registered at PROSPERO (registration ID:
   CRD42023439408).

TI Next-Generation Medical and Therapeutic Ultrasound: From rewarming to
   neuromodulation and thermal ablation
DT Awarded Grant
PD Apr 30 2025
PY 2025
AB Ultrasound is widely known for its therapeutic and medical uses,
   particularly its ability to heat tissues to treat cancerous tumours and
   essential tremor. The success of these applications may be due to their
   flexible operational parameters, allowing for somewhat variable rates of
   tissue heating. However, emerging ultrasound applications, such as
   rewarming of biological cells and tissues after cryopreservation,
   require much tighter control over acoustic and thermal conditions to be
   successful. In rewarming, precise control of heating rate and spatial
   uniformity of temperature is crucial for preventing thermal stress and
   ice formation, which is a significant challenge in rewarming larger
   tissue volumes or organs after storage at low temperatures. Recent
   results demonstrate the promise of ultrasound for rewarming in various
   models, including bovine muscle and rat heart, with high warming rates
   and successful preservation of structure and function, yet challenges
   remain, especially in scaling up to larger, human-sized organs. Beyond
   thermal applications, ultrasound shows promise for neuromodulation of
   the brain for treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. To
   establish thresholds for effect and fully explore its capabilities
   requires precise targeting and control over the ultrasound field inside
   the brain. To achieve this, a greater understanding of the interaction
   of ultrasound with the skull is needed, together with more advanced and
   efficient computational modelling tools that capture all the physics
   needed to predict the propagation of ultrasound through solid materials.
   The aim of this fellowship is to overcome these challenges by developing
   advanced tools for measurement and simulation of ultrasound propagation
   and temperature distributions, and to build comprehensive knowledge of
   the properties of tissues under relevant conditions. Access to these
   tools will accelerate the development of ultrasound applications
   including rewarming after cryopreservation, neuromodulation, and thermal
   ablation. Our initial work laid a foundation in ultrasonic tissue
   rewarming, demonstrating the concept, exploring material properties at
   low temperatures and beginning to address metrology and modelling
   challenges. The next phase will expand on this, tackling fundamental
   issues that apply similarly to other uses of ultrasound. This will
   enhance the efficacy and adoption of therapeutic and medical
   applications of ultrasound such as rewarming, which has the potential
   for broad impact in tissue transplantation, regenerative medicine, and
   tissue engineering; ultrasonic neuromodulation which could offer a
   non-invasive, drug-free alternative for treatment of neurological and
   psychiatric conditions; and high-intensity focused ultrasound for
   treatment of cancer and other disorders. It will also open new avenues
   for application to other uses, all of which will bring significant
   societal and economic benefits, improving health and quality of life.

TI All-Optical Near-Infrared Imaging via Semiconductor Nanocrystals -
   Renewal
DT Awarded Grant
PD Apr 30 2025
PY 2025
AB This project is developing a new technology for Near Infrared (NIR)
   light imaging that is ultra-compact and multi-colour. Human eyes only
   see 0.0035% (visible light) of the electromagnetic spectrum around us.
   Among all invisible spectra, the NIR range is of particular interest
   because of its broad application, for example for medical diagnosis,
   food quality control, autonomous vehicles, and night-vision. In
   conventional NIR-imaging technology, the NIR light gets converted to
   electrons and the resultant image is projected onto a display, where
   electrons get converted to light again to be viewed by the eye.
   Therefore, the converted images are monochrome. Moreover, this display
   blocks the perception of visible light, therefore disrupting normal
   vision. Also, such cameras are either only operational in a short
   wavelength band (e.g. Ge or InGaAs, converting up to 1800nm) or require
   cooling (e.g. InAs or InSb detectors operating at -200 C). Moreover, NIR
   cameras must be bulky to accommodate all components for light/electron
   conversions.  The detectors used in today's technology mean that the
   aforementioned limitations cannot be avoided. This project is developing
   a new technology for NIR-imaging that is all-optical, i.e. no longer
   requires optical and electric signals to be converted to each other.
   This technology employs engineered nanocrystals, embedded within a thin
   and transparent layer, that capture the infrared light and re-emit it in
   the visible range. This approach offers new functionalities as a result
   of: i. being ultra-compact; ii. forming colour images from invisible
   objects; iii. being transparent in both visible and NIR ranges; iv.
   capturing the visual information in the range of 400-4000nm, that is 10
   times wider than the visible spectrum.  Such a revolutionary technology
   will be provided as a transparent thin and flexible layer that can
   upgrade any glass surface e.g. goggles and windows, to an NIR-imaging
   device, enabling a view over both visible and infrared frequencies
   concurrently. Therefore, information that is currently invisible to the
   naked eye will become visible - the ripeness of fruits and species
   health. This technology will also enable us to see invisible objects in
   the dark. Imagine no light pollution and a massive reduction in
   greenhouse gases associated with a world where the lighting was not
   required to see at night.  To develop this technology, engineered arrays
   of nano-crystals, called metasurfaces, are being exploited. These
   metasurfaces are often a few hundred times smaller than a human hair. In
   the first phase of the project, we have managed to comprehensively study
   the ability of nano-crystals and metasurfaces for NIR imaging.
   Subsequently, we have proposed an approach to enhance the capacity of
   metasurfaces for colour conversion by mixing NIR light with an extra
   laser beam and employing sum-frequency generation. As a result, we have
   demonstrated and patented the first prototype of nonlinear metasurfaces
   that can be used for NIR imaging. In the renewal stage of this project,
   we first demonstrate an innovative approach to generate colourful images
   by multi-resonant metasurfaces. Consequently, we will exploit engineered
   metasurfaces for quantum imaging, as the final step for delivering the
   overarching aim: A novel NIR imaging technology at the nanoscale with
   low noise, high resolution, low power consumption, and the ability to
   work at room temperature.

AB Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a prevalent and profoundly debilitating
   complication that afflicts individuals with diabetes mellitus (DM).
   These ulcers are associated with substantial morbidity, recurrence
   rates, disability, and mortality, imposing substantial economic,
   psychological, and medical burdens. Timely detection and intervention
   can mitigate the morbidity and disparities linked to DFU. Nevertheless,
   current therapeutic approaches for DFU continue to grapple with
   multifaceted limitations. A growing body of evidence emphasizes the
   crucial role of cellular senescence in the pathogenesis of chronic
   wounds. Interventions that try to delay cellular senescence, eliminate
   senescent cells (SnCs), or suppress the senescence -associated secretory
   phenotype (SASP) have shown promise for helping chronic wounds to heal.
   In this context, targeting cellular senescence emerges as a novel
   therapeutic strategy for DFU. In this comprehensive review, we look at
   the pathology and treatment of DFU in a systematic way. We also explain
   the growing importance of investigating SnCs in DFU and highlight the
   great potential of senotherapeutics that target SnCs in DFU treatment.
   The development of efficacious and safe senotherapeutics represents a
   pioneering therapeutic approach aimed at enhancing the quality of life
   for individuals affected by DFU.

AB Matrix completion is a challenging problem in computer vision. Recently,
   quaternion representations of color images have achieved competitive
   performance in many fields. The information on the coupling between the
   three channels of the color image is better utilized since the color
   image is treated as a whole. Due to this, researcher interest in
   low-rank quaternion matrix completion (LRQMC) algorithms has grown
   significantly. In contrast to the traditional quaternion matrix
   completion algorithms that rely on quaternion singular value
   decomposition (QSVD), we propose a novel method based on quaternion
   Qatar Riyal decomposition (QQR). First, a novel approach (CQSVD-QQR) to
   computing an approximation of QSVD based on iterative QQR is put
   forward, which has lower computational complexity than QSVD. CQSVD-QQR
   can be employed to calculate the greatest r(r>0) singular values of a
   given quaternion matrix. Following that, we propose a novel quaternion
   matrix completion approach based on CQSVD-QQR which combines low-rank
   and sparse priors of color images. Furthermore, the convergence of the
   algorithm is analyzed. Our model outperforms those state-of-the-art
   approaches following experimental results on natural color images and
   color medical images.

AB Consumer engagement in co-creation is crucial for maintaining a
   successful and sustainable mobile health (mHealth) ecosystem, as
   multiple stages of mHealth services require consumer engagement,
   collaboration, and evaluation. Unlike online health communities and
   offline medical institutions, mHealth encompasses a technology focus and
   human-technology interaction. Compared to healthcare providers primarily
   driven by economic interests, there is a lack of empirical evidence
   concerning what drives consumer engagement in the cocreation of mHealth.
   Thus, we adopted a mixed-method design consisting of two qualitative and
   two quantitative studies. Specifically, we identified four key
   dimensions through an exploratory qualitative study: quality,
   interactive factors, technical cognition, and trust. Then, we further
   analyzed the interrelationship between constructs and proposed our
   proposed framework based on the DeLone and McLean IS success (D&M)
   model. Two quantitative studies validated the applicability of the
   proposed framework in large sample sizes and crosscountry contexts
   (China and the US). In addition, considering the possible asymmetric
   relationship between the antecedents and consumer engagement, we
   utilized the fsQCA method to reveal its configuration patterns. Our
   results further enrich the stream of mHealth research in the information
   system (IS) fields and value co-creation in technology-enabled
   healthcare services. Moreover, our focus on technology factors provides
   opportunities for system design and improvement of mHealth.

AB Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the role of diaphragmatic
   dysfunction in extubation failure among patients at high risk of
   reintubation. Material and methods: This prospective cohort study was
   carried out at a intensive care unit in China. Adult patients who had
   been intubated for more than 24 h and ready for extubation were included
   in the study if they exhibited a high risk of extubation failure.
   Diaphragm dysfunction was defined as a diaphragmatic thickening fraction
   <30 % or diaphragmatic excursion <10 mm. The primary outcome was defined
   as extubation failure, which includes either reintubation or death
   within the initial 7 days following extubation. Results: Out of the 113
   patients, 27 (23.89 %) experienced extubation failure, with diaphragm
   dysfunction diagnosed in 63 (55.75 %) individuals. Patients who failed
   extubation were significantly more likely to have diaphragm dysfunction
   (85.19 % vs. 46.51 %, p < 0.01). In the Cox-proportional hazards
   regression analysis, diaphragm dysfunction and the Medical Research
   Council score were found to be associated with extubation failure. The
   adjusted hazard ratios were 4.56 [95 % CI: 1.56-13.33] and 0.93 [95 %
   CI: 0.88-0.99]. Both variables were closely correlated with extubation
   failure showing statistical significance. Conclusion: Diaphragm
   dysfunction could contribute to an elevated extubation failure rate.

AB Medical device industry is currently facing significant challenges in
   transitioning from a linear to a circular economy, particularly for
   single-use medical devices (SUMDs). This article explores the
   complexities of material recovery, the impact of sterilization methods
   on device reusability, and the regulatory and economic barriers that
   hinder sustainable practices. SUMDs often comprise multi-materials,
   complicating recycling efforts due to the difficulty in separating these
   materials. Reusability through the sterilization process can impact the
   physical and chemical properties of the devices posing challenges to
   maintaining quality and biocompatibility. Regulatory frameworks that
   prioritize patient safety over environmental impact further complicate
   the adoption of circular economy practices. Despite these challenges,
   there are numerous opportunities for embedding circularity in the
   medical device industry. Innovations in design and material science,
   such as modular product assembly, use of biodegradable and recyclable
   materials, advancement in recycling technologies, establishing of
   legislative framework, and right-to-repair regulations can improve the
   sustainability of medical devices.

AB Radiology report generation is of significant importance. Unlike
   standard image captioning tasks, radiology report generation faces more
   pronounced visual and textual biases due to constrained data
   availability, making it increasingly reliant on prior knowledge in this
   context. In this paper, we introduce a radiology report generation
   network termed Dynamics Priori Networks (DPN), which leverages a dynamic
   knowledge graph and prior knowledge. Concretely, we establish an
   adaptable graph network and harness both medical domain knowledge and
   expert insights to enhance the model's intelligence. Notably, we
   introduce an image-text contrastive module and an image-text matching
   module to enhance the quality of the generated results. Our method is
   evaluated on two widely available datasets: X-ray collection from
   Indiana University (IU X-ray) and Medical Information Mart for Intensive
   Care, Chest X-Ray (MIMIC-CXR), where it demonstrates superior
   performance, particularly excelling in critical metrics.

AB Accurate and portable Blood Pressure (BP) monitoring is vital for
   managing cardiovascular diseases. However, existing wearable continuous
   BP monitoring technologies are often inaccurate and rely on external
   calibration, limiting their practical application in continuous BP
   monitoring. To address this challenge, we have developed a Wearable
   continuous non-invasive BP Monitor (WeBPM) equipped with a finger cuff
   sensor, capable of monitoring BP continuously and accurately within
   medical-grade precision. WeBPM integrates advanced finger oscillographic
   BP measurement technology to provide reliable self-calibration
   functionality. Moreover, Pulsatile Cycle Volume Adjustment Method
   (PCVAM) we proposed for the closed-loop phase can continuously track
   changes in vasomotor tone under a controlled frequency based on
   pulsatile cycles, thereby enabling continuous BP measurement. In
   comparative experiments with the Nexfin monitor, WeBPM demonstrates
   excellent performance in induced dynamic BP experiments, with
   measurement errors of (-1.4 +/- 6.24) mmHg for Systolic BP (SBP) and
   (-0.82 +/- 4.83) mmHg for Diastolic BP (DBP). Additionally, compared to
   clinical invasive reference measurements, WeBPM's SBP and DBP
   measurement errors are (-1.74 +/- 4.9) mmHg and (0.37 +/- 3.28) mmHg,
   respectively, further proving its outstanding performance. These results
   highlight WeBPM's potential in personalized health management and remote
   monitoring, offering a new solution for continuous non-invasive BP
   monitoring.

AB Edge computing, a novel paradigm for performing computations at the
   network edge, holds significant relevance in the healthcare domain for
   extracting medical knowledge from traditional Uygur medical texts.
   Medical knowledge extraction methods based on edge computing deploy deep
   learning models on edge devices to achieve localized entity and relation
   extraction. This approach avoids transferring substantial sensitive data
   to cloud data centers, effectively safeguarding the privacy of
   healthcare services. However, existing relation extraction methods
   mainly employ a sequential pipeline approach, which classifies relations
   between determined entities after entity recognition. This mode faces
   challenges such as error propagation between tasks, insufficient
   consideration of dependencies between the two subtasks, and the neglect
   of interrelations between different relations within a sentence. To
   address these challenges, a joint extraction model with parameter
   sharing in edge computing is proposed, named CoEx-Bert. This model
   leverages shared parameterization between two models to jointly extract
   entities and relations. Specifically, CoEx-Bert employs two models, each
   separately sharing hidden layer parameters, and combines these two loss
   functions for joint backpropagation to optimize the model parameters.
   Additionally, it effectively resolves the issue of entity overlapping
   when extracting knowledge from unstructured Uygur medical texts by
   considering contextual relations. Finally, this model is deployed on
   edge devices for real-time extraction and inference of Uygur medical
   knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that CoEx-Bert outperforms
   existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving accuracy, recall, and
   F1-score of 90.65%, 92.45%, and 91.54%, respectively, in the Uygur
   traditional medical literature dataset. These improvements represent a
   6.45% increase in accuracy, a 9.45% increase in recall, and a 7.95%
   increase in F1-score compared to the baseline.

AB Modular self-assembling nanoparticle vaccines, represent a cutting-edge
   approach in immunology with the potential to revolutionize vaccine
   design and efficacy. Although many innovative efficient modular
   self-assembling nanoparticles have been designed for vaccination, the
   immune activation characteristics underlying such strong protection
   remain poorly understood, limiting the further expansion of such
   nanocarrier. Here, we prepared a novel modular nanovaccine, which
   self-assembled via a pentamer cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) domain and
   an unnatural trimer domain, presenting S. Paratyphi A O-polysaccharide
   antigen, and investigated its rapid immune activation mechanism. The
   nanovaccine efficiently targets draining lymph nodes and
   antigen-presenting cells, facilitating co-localization with Golgi and
   endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, dendritic cells, macrophages, B
   cells, and neutrophils potentially participate in antigen presentation,
   unveiling a dynamic change of the vaccines in lymph nodes. Single-cell
   RNA sequencing at early stage and iN vivo/iN vitro experiments reveal
   its potent humoral immune response capabilities and protection effects.
   This nanoparticle outperforms traditional CTB carriers in eliciting
   robust prophylactic effects in various infection models. This work not
   only provides a promising and efficient candidate vaccine, but also
   promotes the design and application of the new type of selfassembled
   nanoparticle, offering a safe and promising vaccination strategy for
   infection diseases.

AB Purpose: Energy-resolving photon-counting detectors (ERPCDs) are
   expected to enable novel functional diagnosis using quantitative X-ray
   images such as effective atomic number (Zeff) images. In this simulation
   study, we sought to optimize the settings related to tube voltage and
   energy windows. Methods: We assumed a virtual phantom composed of
   polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA, Zeff = 6.5) and aluminum (Zeff = 13.0),
   and simulated the conventional energy integrating detector (EID) image
   and Zeff images obtained by the ERPCD. The investigational phantom is
   composed of elements with rho t ranging from 0.1 to 80 g/cm2. In order
   to perform optimization using a quantitative index, we defined a system
   performance function (SPF) that takes into account the contributions of
   the contrast to noise ratio (CNR) of the EID image and the uncertainty
   (delta Zeff) of the Zeff image. The tube voltage was varied to be 60,
   90, and 120 kV, and the variable that determines the separation energy
   between the middle and high energy windows was changed from 35 to 115
   keV with 5 keV interval. In addition, preclinical images of the digital
   phantoms based on computed tomography (CT) images were created for
   demonstration. Results: We were able to determine the imaging conditions
   that yielded the better image quality for tube voltages of 60, 90, and
   120 kV. Among these, the 120 kV condition (20-30-50-120 keV) showed the
   smallest SPF value, and was therefore adopted as the optimal condition.
   Furthermore, high-quality EID and Zeff images of preclinical phantoms
   were obtained under the optimal condition. Conclusions: We determined
   the optimal condition suitable for deriving both qualitative and
   quantitative images using ERPCDs.

AB Background: Teaching intensive care medicine competencies poses
   challenges due to trainees' heterogenous backgrounds, shift schedules,
   and short rotations. To address these challenges, weekly flipped
   classroom modules (FCMs) were introduced, combining online preparation,
   control questions, and an on-site course co-facilitated by a trainee and
   an intensivist. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and
   acceptance of these FCMs. Methods: This pre-post intervention study used
   a triangulated methodology. Learning management system (LMS) user data
   were analysed regarding preparation and mobile access. Pre- and
   post-surveys assessed trainees' perception of training formats, learning
   motivation, and preparation benefits using Likert scales. Open-ended
   responses were evaluated through content analysis. Results: All 30
   trainees accessed the LMS, with an average online participation rate of
   78 %, higher among fellows (89 %) than residents (71 %). Mobile devices
   were used by 20 trainees (67 %), and over half of FCM activities were
   accessed this way. Training formats with FCMs scored significantly
   higher post-implementation. The FCMs scored 4.7 (SD = 0.5),
   outperforming other teaching formats (p < 0.04). Perceived learning
   motivation scores increased from 19.0 (SD = 4.5) pre-FCM to 23.8 (SD =
   3.0) post-FCM (p < 0.001). Median perceived preparation benefit rose
   from 15 to 18 (p < 0.001). Trainees appreciated the flexibility,
   quality, variety of materials, and control question. Acknowledging FCMs
   as relevant starting point for acquiring fundamental ICU knowledge.
   Conclusions: Weekly FCMs are both feasibly and well-accepted and may
   enhance learning motivation in intensive care training. Further
   multicentre and qualitative studies are recommended to validate their
   impact.

AB Polymeric coronary stents, like the ABSORBTM, are commonly used to treat
   atherosclerosis due to their bioresorbable and cell-compatible polymer
   structure. However, they face challenges such as high strut thickness,
   high elastic recoil, and lack of radiopacity. This study aims to address
   these limitations by modifying degradable stents produced by additive
   manufacturing with poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) with degradable metallic coatings,
   specifically zinc (Zn) and magnesium (Mg), deposited via radiofrequency
   (rf) magnetron sputtering. The characterisation included the evaluation
   of the degradation of the coatings, antibacterial, anti-thrombogenicity,
   radiopacity, and mechanical properties. The results showed that the
   metallic coatings inhibited bacterial growth, though Mg exhibited a high
   degradation rate. Thrombogenicity studies showed that Zn-coated stents
   had anticoagulant properties, while Mg- coated and controls were
   thrombogenic. Zn coatings significantly improved radiopacity, enhancing
   contrast by 43 %. Mechanical testing revealed that metallic coatings
   reduced yield strength and, thus, diminished elastic recoil after stent
   expansion. Zn-coated stents improved cyclic compression resistance by
   270 % for PCL stents, with PLA-based stents showing smaller
   improvements. The coatings also enhanced crush resistance, particularly
   for Zn-coated PCL stents. Overall, Zn-coated polymers have emerged as
   the premier prototype due to their superior biological and mechanical
   performance, appropriate degradation during the stent life, and ability
   to provide the appropriate radiopacity to medical devices.

AB Quasi-static elastography (QSE) is a well-established technique used in
   medical imaging, where ultrasound data is collected both, before and
   after applying a slight compression on a tissue. This data is then
   analyzed to create image frames that reveal the stiffness parameter of
   the underlying tissue medium. Previous studies have focused on assessing
   how the Conventional Focused Beam (CFB) transmit method impacts the
   ultrasound elastography image quality. Recent studies have also shown an
   interest in synthetic aperture techniques like the Diverging Beam
   Synthetic Aperture Technique (DBSAT), due to its potential to enhance
   ultrasound image quality. However, its application in elastography has
   received limited attention. This paper introduces a new strategy of
   averaging low-resolution elastogram frames (LREA), obtained from DBSAT
   transmit method to improve the quality of elastography images. The CFB
   technique involves scanning the tissue line by line. In contrast, DBSAT
   is a synthetic aperture method that generates multiple low-resolution
   elastogram frames before combining them together to create a single
   high-quality image. In this research paper all the experimental studies
   were conducted on an agar-gelatin phantom, demonstrating the
   effectiveness of estimating elastograms from the low-resolution frame
   data of DBSAT transmit scheme and then summing them together to produce
   an elastogram with enhanced image quality. The results show a maximum
   improvement of 8 dB in the image quality metric of signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) as well as a 7 dB improvement in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)
   when comparing elastography images obtained by the proposed LREA method
   and the elastography images obtained by regular processing of the RF
   data acquired using the different methods of CFB and DBSAT.

AB Small Intestinal Stromal Tumor (SIST) is a potentially malignant
   neoplasm characterized by a lack of specific clinical manifestations.
   Accurately detecting SIST from computed tomography (CT) scans is a
   crucial but challenging endeavor within precision oncology imaging.
   Manual annotation currently serves as the prevailing clinical practice
   for tumors' longitudinal assessment, proving to be both highly
   time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. Effectively training an
   automatic detection algorithm is desirable but relies heavily on the
   availability of abundant pixel-level labeled data. How to exploit
   limited medical image features to obtain accurate feature representation
   is a mainstream research topic. Embedding 3D context into 2D networks is
   acknowledged to be advantageous for this differential task.
   Nevertheless, current detection algorithms integrate 3D contextual
   information at the backbone backend, resulting in the loss of such
   information in the early stages. This limitation hampers the algorithm's
   capability to effectively learn more intricate 3D features. In this
   work, we focus on SIST detection in CT images and propose a novel SIST
   detection algorithm that leverages 3D contextual information and
   incorporates weakly supervised segmentation as an auxiliary method to
   automatically identify and classify lesions. Specifically, our algorithm
   takes slice grouping as input to introduce contextual information and
   designs a 3D multi-scale feature fusion network (3DMF Net) to fully
   integrate 3D contextual features and multi-scale features, effectively
   enriching the feature expression of SIST. Furthermore, to alleviate a
   substantial number of false positive problems in SIST prediction
   results, we design a weakly supervised semantic segmentation auxiliary
   branch, using box-level annotations as initial pseudo-masks, and
   optimized by a graph theoretical network. Finally, our segmentation
   branch provides auxiliary prior cues to the detection branch, achieving
   more robust detection results. The empirical results on the SIST dataset
   show that the proposed algorithm yields state-of-the-art results.

AB INTRODUCTION: Visual Abstract is a visual summary of the most relevant
   information from a scientific article, presented as an infographic.
   Despite the growing use of Visual Abstracts by journals around the
   world, studies evaluating their components to guide their development
   remain scarce.
   OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study is to identify the
   aesthetic perceptions of Visual Abstracts components by physicians and
   medical students.
   METHODS: Cross-sectional study, using a virtual questionnaire sent via
   email to a convenience sample comprising physicians and medical
   students. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, with means
   and standard deviation or median and interquartile range, depending on
   the type of the variable distribution. Categorical variables are
   presented in absolute and relative numbers.
   RESULT: The research sample consisted mainly of medical students (65%),
   who were female (57.2%), with a median age of 23.5 years (IQR 21-42.25).
   The majority of respondents declared no prior knowledge on Visual
   Abstracts (61.7%). Of the analyzed variables, preferences included icons
   (56.7%), in a monochrome style (36.7%), second-dimensional (81.1%), and
   moderately detailed layout (56.7%), using the "original" color (91.7%),
   and structured in IMRaD format (73.9%).
   CONCLUSION: Several visual components influence the aesthetic perception
   of physicians and medical students regarding Visual Abstracts, with
   particular emphasis on textual objectivity, clarity of colors, and the
   use of icons.

AB Piezoelectric micro-robots have gained considerable attention in rescue
   and medical applications due to their rapid response times and high
   positioning accuracy. In this paper, inspired by the human butterfly
   locomotion pattern, we propose a novel resonant four-legged
   piezoelectric micro-robot designed to achieve fast and efficient
   movement in complex and confined spaces. The robot utilizes the parallel
   piezoelectric bimorph as the driving unit, and its leg structure mimics
   the butterfly motion. By employing asymmetric driving forces, the robot
   can achieve multi-directional movement. A dynamic model of the robot is
   developed, and the stress and motion characteristics are analyzed. The
   finite element method (FEM) is applied to optimize the structural
   parameters and determine the robot's optimal operating frequency.
   Finally, the prototype of the piezoelectric robot is constructed, and
   its performance is evaluated. The results show that, under an excitation
   voltage of 80 V, the robot achieves a maximum speed of 66.1 mm/s, can
   carry a load of up to 100 g, and withstand a maximum drag force of 15.3
   mN. The robot demonstrates sub-micron resolution, excellent
   environmental adaptability, and precise rotational capabilities, making
   it suitable for tasks such as exploration, mapping, and sampling in
   constrained environments.

   Health Record (EHR) based system has allowed for resource savings and
   effective data transactions between patients and doctors. However, this
   transition poses threats to security, privacy, and validation. The
   proposed research explores integrating Aadhaar and blockchain technology
   to create an interoperable EHR system that ensures patient data's secure
   preservation and transmission, prioritizing data integrity, privacy, and
   accessibility. Implementing the proposed system in solidity has allowed
   to incorporate of the two-factor authentication based on unique key
   generation, empowering patients to control access and distribution of
   their health records over time. The Aadhaar acts as an infallible
   verifier, ensuring precise record linkage through Verifiable Credentials
   within the blockchain-based EHR structure tested over Ethereum. Through
   the synergy of cryptography and blockchain, our vision aims for a future
   where healthcare data is decentralized and impenetrable, providing
   individuals and healthcare providers with tools to enhance data
   authority and work without any middleware or third parties, thus
   directly linking doctors and patients. This seamless connection between
   doctors and patients offers a promising vision for the future of
   healthcare information management.

AB The rapid development of artificial intelligence has constantly reshaped
   the field of intelligent healthcare and medicine. Asa vital technology,
   multimodal learning has increasingly garnered interest because of data
   complementarity, comprehensive information fusion, and great application
   potential. Currently, numerous researchers are dedicating their
   attention to this field, conducting extensive studies and constructing
   abundant intelligent systems. Naturally, an open question arises that
   has multimodal learning delivered universal intelligence in healthcare?
   To answer this question, we adopt three unique viewpoints for a holistic
   analysis. Firstly, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the current
   progress of medical multimodal learning from the perspectives of
   datasets, task-oriented methods, and universal foundation models. Based
   on them, we further discuss the proposed question from five issues to
   explore the real impacts of advanced techniques in healthcare, from data
   and technologies to performance and ethics. The answer is that current
   technologies have NOT achieved universal intelligence and there remains
   a significant journey to undertake. Finally, in light of the above
   reviews and discussions, we point out ten potential directions for
   exploration to promote multimodal fusion technologies in the domain,
   towards the goal of universal intelligence in healthcare.

AB Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) facilitates a comprehensive
   examination of macular edema and associated lesions. Manual delineation
   of retinal fluid is labor-intensive and error-prone, necessitating an
   automated diagnostic and therapeutic planning mechanism. Conventional
   supervised learning models are hindered by dataset limitations, while
   Transformer-based large vision models exhibit challenges in medical
   image segmentation, particularly in detecting small, subtle lesions in
   OCT images. This paper introduces the Multidimensional
   Directionality-Enhanced Retinal Fluid Segmentation framework (MD-DERFS),
   which reduces the limitations inherent in conventional supervised models
   by adapting a transformer-based large vision model for macular edema
   segmentation. The proposed MD-DERFS introduces a Multi-Dimensional
   Feature Re-Encoder Unit (MFU) to augment the model's proficiency in
   recognizing specific textures and pathological features through
   directional prior extraction and an Edema Texture Mapping Unit (ETMU), a
   Cross-scale Directional Insight Network (CDIN) furnishes a holistic
   perspective spanning local to global details, mitigating the large
   vision model's deficiencies in capturing localized feature information.
   Additionally, the framework is augmented by a Harmonic Minutiae
   Segmentation Equilibrium loss (G HMSE ) that can address the challenges
   of data imbalance and annotation scarcity in macular edema datasets.
   Empirical validation on the MacuScan-8k dataset shows that MD-DERFS
   surpasses existing segmentation methodologies, demonstrating its
   efficacy in adapting large vision models for boundary-sensitive medical
   imaging tasks. The code is publicly available at
   https://github.com/IMOP-lab/MD-DERFS-Pytorch.git.

AB The Fourth Industrial Revolution, driven by the Internet, has generated
   significant technological advances, transforming various aspects of
   daily life, including the healthcare industry. Blockchain technology
   emerges as an innovative solution to address problems related to breast
   pathology. Being a decentralized network that records 'data' events in
   chained blocks, it offers security and transparency when storing
   information. Initially, blockchain was applied to cryptocurrencies and
   has spread to various industries, including healthcare in senology,
   where it facilitates the management of electronic medical records, such
   as mammograms interpreted using machine learning technology, biopsy
   results, scan interpretation, and the use or consumption. of
   medications, thus facilitating the exchange of data for prevention,
   diagnosis, management of medical or pharmaceutical supplies and
   research. Blockchain adoption presents ethical and practical challenges,
   especially in information confidentiality. Furthermore, the digital
   divide and unequal access to the Internet represent obstacles to its
   equitable implementation. Similarly, the use of blockchain raises
   questions about truth and trust in data, as it theoretically offers
   integrity and security, necessitating full epistemological validation of
   its usefulness in generating knowledge. In short, blockchain has the
   potential to revolutionize the healthcare industry; However, it is
   crucial that its implementation faces ethical, legal and technological
   challenges to ensure genuine social benefit and avoid exacerbating
   inequalities. Constant evaluation of its impact and integration with
   current systems are essential to maximize its potential while mitigating
   its risks. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Espa &

AB A crowd crush that occurred in Itaewon, South Korea during Halloween in
   2022 resulted in 158 people. Much attention was paid to finding culprits
   rather than identifying underlying factors and their complex
   relationships. Hence, this study aims to analyze systemic causes of
   Itaewon crowd crush. AcciMap was conducted to understand what caused the
   crush and resultant deaths using two information sources: South Korean
   National Assembly Report and online news articles. Findings suggest that
   lifted COVID-19 restrictions, increased popularity of Halloween, and
   political and social factors related to a new government significantly
   increased the crowd size. Despite anticipated risks of crowd crush,
   including direct calls from citizens, little was done before and after
   the crush. Pre-planning was not conducted, and on-site controls were
   insufficient. After the crush, unified incident communication was
   non-existent and inter-agency collaboration was poorly coordinated,
   leading to severe delay in site access, triage, medical treatment, and
   hospitalization. Until Itaewon disaster, a crowd crush was not covered
   by overarching disaster management law of South Korea. To prevent
   similar crowd crushes, recommendations include trans-governmental
   efforts to identify emergent impacts of policy, cultural, and
   administrative changes, all-hazards management approach, improving
   national safety leadership and risk governance, safety culture sensitive
   to failure, and nationwide crowd management system. As the first and
   early systemic analysis of Itaewon crowd crush, our findings highlighted
   the need to understand influences from various sociotechnical factors.
   We hope our study to inform future investigations of Itaewon crowd crush
   and induce more rigorous efforts to prevent similar incidents.

AB Resorcin[4]arene based fluorescent sensors RES-AAQ containing eight
   anthraquinone groups as binding sites, were developed for very accurate
   and sensitive detection of Fe3+ metal ion. The motivation for this study
   lies in the need for advanced sensing techniques for precisely
   identifying Fe3+ ions. Due to its unique redox properties, Fe3+ plays a
   crucial role in biological processes, environmental remediation, medical
   diagnostics, and advanced detection methods. The sensors were
   extensively characterized using FT-IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and ESI-MS
   techniques. The absorption spectra revealed significant interactions
   between RES-AAQ and Fe3+ ions. Fluorescence quenching was observed due
   to Photoinduced electron transfer (PET). The quenching process was
   systematically analyzed using Stern-Volmer analysis. Each sensor (L1,
   L2, L3, L4) demonstrated remarkable detection limits for Fe3+ ions
   (10.51 nM, 10.48 nM, 10.49 nM, 10.47 nM, respectively) along with
   substantial binding affinities (binding constants: 9.07x109 M-1,
   1.19x109 M-1, 1.49x109 M-1 and 1.03x109 M-1 for L1, L2, L3, and L4,
   respectively). Traditional, Fe3+ detection methods often suffer from
   limitations such as complexity, lack of sensitivity, or interference
   from other metal ions. This research offers highly sensitive fluorescent
   sensors for Fe3+ detection with potential applications in human blood
   serum and tap water. Molecular docking, DFT studies, and ESI-MS
   investigation have been employed to gain insights into the binding
   interactions between the molecules. The low detection limits, high
   binding affinity, and real-world applicability highlight the significant
   advantages of developed sensors compared to existing methods.
   Additionally, a combinatorial logic gate was constructed to facilitate a
   proper understanding of the working principle of RES-AAQ.

AB Ultrasound (US) imaging is widely used in clinical practice for the
   diagnosis and treatment of various diseases. Supervised learning
   algorithms for US image analysis typically require large-scale labeled
   data. However, the acquisition of such datasets has always been a
   challenge in the field of medical ultrasound. We propose a generative
   adversarial network-based synthesis method guided by semantic prior
   information and attention for synthesizing realistic US images. In this
   method, the US image-rich semantic structural information is utilized as
   prior knowledge, the texture feature is introduced to form semantic
   labels for guiding the generator synthesis, and the detailed background
   texture structure is enhanced while considering lesion information. A
   channel attention module is designed to selectively emphasize important
   channel information features, which integrates the correlation between
   all channel feature maps and reduces the loss of high-frequency semantic
   information in the input labels. Furthermore, we propose a
   regularization feature loss to punish the deep feature difference
   between real and synthetic images, retain the high-level semantic
   features in the source image, and further improve the synthesis quality.
   A large number of experiments were conducted on two challenging datasets
   to validate our method. Comparative analysis, ablation experiments,
   customized synthesis, and segmentation tests all demonstrated that our
   method can synthesize US images with more detailed structural
   information and fine contours.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the demand for more efficient
   Smart Health Monitoring Systems (SHMS) in healthcare. While clustering
   techniques are widely used to improve energy efficiency and reduce data
   latency in smart hospitals, existing solutions often fail to fully
   exploit the potential of clustering. This paper introduces a novel
   Multi-Level Clustering Algorithm (MLCA) to enhance energy efficiency and
   reduce network latency in SHMS. Additionally, the paper integrates
   wireless power transmission (WPT) technology with a Grey Wolf
   Optimizer-based Tour Optimization of Power Transmitter Device (GWO-TOP),
   uniquely considering patients' real-time health status scores alongside
   traditional metrics like remaining energy and node lifetime. The
   incorporation of health status scores allows for more intelligent
   prioritization in the PTD's charging schedule, leading to improved
   network longevity and better patient care. Simulation results
   demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in extending network
   life, reducing delays, and optimizing patient monitoring. These findings
   highlight the potential of GWO-TOP to significantly advance SHMS by
   improving both system efficiency and patient outcomes.

AB Emotion recognition, a burgeoning field with applications in healthcare,
   human-computer interaction, and affective computing, has seen
   significant advances by integrating physiological signals and
   environmental factors. With the increasing development of Artificial
   Intelligence (AI), the precision and efficiency of machine learning (ML)
   algorithms are becoming increasingly crucial to a growing number of
   businesses. However, the mystery and black-box effect of ML methods
   limits our ability to comprehend the underlying applied logic and merely
   allow us to obtain results. Consequently, understanding the intricate
   models created for emotion recognition is still vital. ML techniques,
   such as Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) classifiers, were used
   to predict emotional labels on a dataset collected from an actual study
   that includes environmental and physiological sensors. In this paper,
   four performance indicators were used to evaluate the results:
   precision, recall, precision, and F1 score. Based on the findings, the
   RF and DT algorithms demonstrated impressive performance with an average
   accuracy of 98%, precision of 97.8%, recall of 97.8%, and F-measure of
   98.2%. Furthermore, this paper discusses the use of Explainable
   Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as Shapley additive
   explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations
   (LIME) that were implemented and applied to the results obtained from
   these ML methods, to improve the interpretability and transparency of
   emotion recognition systems that integrate physiological signals and
   environmental factors. This article investigates the significance of
   these methods in providing insights into the relationships between human
   emotions and external stimuli and their potential to advance
   personalized and context-based applications in various domains.

AB Automatic medical image segmentation has a wide range of applications
   and high research values in medical research and practice, which can
   assist medical workers in clinical lesion assessment and diagnosis
   analysis of disease. However, it is still challenging due to the
   large-scale variations, blurred structural boundaries, and irregular
   shapes of segmentation targets in medical images. To tackle these
   challenges, we propose a selective edge aggregation Transformer
   (SEAformer) with an encoder-decoder architecture for 2D medical image
   segmentation. Specifically, we first combine densely connected CNNs and
   Transformers (with Dense MLP) in a parallel manner to forma dual encoder
   that efficiently captures shallow texture information and global
   contextual information in medical images in a deeper, multi-scale way.
   Then, we propose a plug- and-play selective edge aggregation (SEA)
   module that removes the noisy background unsupervisedly, selects and
   retains useful edge features, making the network more focused on the
   information related to the target boundary. Finally, we design a loss
   function that combines the target content and edges and use a multilevel
   optimization (MLO) strategy to refine the blur structure. This
   optimization helps the network to learn better feature representations
   and produce more accurate segmentation results. In addition, due to our
   densely connected approach to building the entire network, SEAformer has
   only 16 MB parameters and 32 GFlops. Extensive experimental results show
   that SEAformer performs well compared with state-of-the-art methods in
   four different challenging medical segmentation tasks, including skin
   lesion segmentation, thyroid nodules segmentation, GLAnd segmentation,
   and COVID-19 infection segmentation.

AB Brain tumors area leading cause of neurological impairment, often
   resulting in severe consequences, including fatality. Timely detection
   of brain tumors is imperative for effective intervention, with Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (MRI) standing out as the most efficient method for
   identifying irregularities in the brain. In this paper, we introduce a
   novel approach for MRI-based brain tumor segmentation (BTS): The
   Modified Recurrent Residual Attention U-Net (Mod-R2AU-Net). The proposed
   architecture integrates recurrent and residual components within both
   encoding and decoding paths, leveraging Recurrent Residual Convolutional
   Layers to dynamically capture temporal dependencies and subtle image
   features. Attention gates (AGs) are employed to enhance feature
   refinement and segmentation accuracy, replacing conventional skip
   connections. Before segmentation, MRI images undergo a sophisticated
   preprocessing phase aimed at optimizing image fidelity, including noise
   reduction and spatial alignment to ensure the highest quality input for
   the segmentation model. The Mod-R2AU-Net model outperforms existing
   segmentation models, notably due to the integration of AGs resulting in
   improved segmentation accuracy. Performance evaluation includes
   objective metrics such as Binary Accuracy, Dice coefficient, and
   Intersection over Union, along with a subjective assessment of the
   segmentation results. Additionally, our research extends to seamlessly
   integrating the model into a comprehensive pipeline designed to refine
   BTS in medical images, enhancing precision in detecting and delineating
   intricate brain tumor boundaries and advancing the effectiveness of
   medical image analysis.

AB The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is transforming healthcare by
   allowing the storage of patient data for diagnostics and treatment.
   However, this technology faces significant challenges, including
   ensuring data reliability, security, quality, and privacy. This study
   proposes a new architecture that uses Federated Learning (FL) and
   BigchainDB to address these issues. By using FL and BigchainDB, only
   authorized and trustworthy devices can store their data in the
   blockchain. This prevents unauthorized access to the blockchain and its
   stored data. We evaluated this architecture on a real-world model. Our
   security mechanism successfully detects and blocks >89% of malicious
   attacks on the blockchain network. This filtering process ensures that
   only validated transactions are stored in the blockchain. As a result,
   fewer transactions are sent to the blockchain, and less data is placed
   in the memory pool. Our approach increases blockchain throughput while
   lowering latency. By using a multi-level blockchain, we enhance patient
   privacy by restricting access to personal data. This research
   contributes to the development of a secure, efficient, and
   privacy-preserving IoMT system. By leveraging the power of FL and
   BigchainDB, we can ensure that patient data is secure, reliable, and
   accessible only to authorized parties, ultimately improving the quality
   of care and patient outcomes.

AB Objective: To explore family perspectives on physical restraint
   practices and their minimization in an adult intensive care unit. Design
   & Methods: A qualitative descriptive study with one-on-one
   semi-structured interviews. A deductive content analysis approach was
   undertaken using the Theoretical Domains Framework. Setting: A 20-bed
   medical, surgical, trauma ICU in Toronto, Canada. Findings: Fifteen
   family members were interviewed. Three themes emerged: (i) barriers and
   facilitators to restraint minimization. Barriers noted by families
   included patient agitation posing risks of losing endotracheal tubes,
   nurse reluctance to remove restraints, lack of family involvement,
   limited knowledge of alternatives, and a noisy environment. Facilitators
   included family involvement in decision-making, timely extubation, use
   of less restrictive alternatives such as mittens, mandating shorter
   periods of restraints application, and environmental modifications; (ii)
   unilateral decision-making regarding physical restraint use, where
   clinicians made decisions with inadequate communication with families
   nor obtaining consent; and (iii) the emotional impact of physical
   restraint use, with families experiencing sadness and shock and
   believing the patient would feel similarly. Conclusion: This qualitative
   study highlights significant issues surrounding the use of physical
   restraints, particularly the lack of family involvement in
   decision-making, the emotional toll on families, and various barriers
   and facilitators to minimizing restraint use. Effective communication
   and collaboration between clinicians and families are crucial to
   addressing these issues. Implications for Clinical Practice: Our
   findings underscore the critical need to enhance communication between
   clinicians and families, alongside consent processes. Identifying
   barriers and facilitators at various levels can inform individualized
   strategies to reduce restraint use, including integrating alternatives
   like mittens and involving families in care. Timely introduction of
   alternatives and family involvement are vital to prevent further
   emotional distress for families. Prioritizing the reduction of restraint
   duration is crucial, particularly in settings emphasizing harm
   minimization.

AB Hydroxyapatite (HAP) bio-composites play a prominent role in addressing
   the reparative and replacement needs of human bone and dental tissues.
   Despite the suboptimal mechanical characteristics inherent in pure HAP,
   strength and durability enhancements have been achieved by incorporating
   various alloys and materials. The provided study delves into the
   radiation shielding and mechanical attributes of Fe2O3-reinforced HAP
   composites intended for use as implants, featuring Fe2O3 concentrations
   at 0.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 wt%. In addition, by leveraging the robust
   FLUKA Monte Carlo simulation code, the study explores the composites'
   response to the magnetic field. The findings suggest that augmenting the
   Fe2O3 content improves radiation shielding and mechanical properties in
   the chosen samples. Furthermore, in the absence of a magnetic field, the
   particles' spatial distribution (contour curves) exhibits symmetry along
   the X-axis. Nonetheless, a discernible pattern becomes apparent upon
   exposure to a magnetic field of Bx = 5 micro Tesla. The data extracted
   from this article can be used for medical and therapeutic applications
   and subsequent studies.

AB This study introduces the simulation framework THOR, which was designed
   to include the creation and transport of electrons and holes in
   pixelated semiconductors detectors used for x-ray imaging in the
   PENELOPE v. 2014 Monte Carlo code and its penEasy v.2015 extension.
   Following the simulation of radiation transport and energy deposition in
   the detector, the THOR code breaks down into electron-hole pair (EHP)
   creation, transport, trapping, and modes of detection, including
   simulations of energy integrating and photon counting detectors.
   Validation of the THOR code was conducted using the ARTEMIS code. This
   study shows the impact of the simulation parameters (detector geometry,
   photon energy, charge carrier dispersion, etc.) on the detector
   performance metrics. Notably, the energy cut-off for transport of
   electrons and photons were found to significantly influence accuracy and
   computational speed, with the identification of the optimal value as 250
   eV for improved computational performance without sacrificing accuracy.
   The ability to adjust the energy necessary to create an EHP specifically
   for a-Se sensors introduce a novel approach to balancing speed and
   accuracy effectively. Moreover, the THOR code allows the user to choose
   the bias direction and which charge is collected, showing the code's
   adaptability across various operational scenarios and materials. For
   instance, the results showed that using a negative bias and collecting
   holes results in a worst spatial resolution because the charge would
   have to travel a longer distance to be collected. Additionally, since
   the probability of trapping increases with the distance traveled by the
   charge carrier, trapping becomes a more significant factor in detection
   simulations for longer distances. The inclusion or exclusion of charge
   trapping in simulations can significantly influence the detector
   efficiency, with differences up to 60%. Analysis of physical parameters
   such as photon energy, detector thickness, composition, and applied
   electric field provides insights into their effects on detector
   performance metrics. Understanding these effects is essential for
   optimizing imaging systems for specific applications, thereby advancing
   diagnostic capabilities and patient care in medical imaging. In summary,
   this study offers a comprehensive understanding of detector behavior and
   simulation optimization, aiming to enhance imaging techniques.

AB Implementing job rotation (JR) can yield positive or negative impacts
   depending on the firm characteristics and industry type. As a result, a
   generic framework for its implementation is difficult to develop and
   presently does not exist in literature. Existing models/frameworks have
   limited application as they are either too specific or generic, but
   imprecise. Consequently, managers often rely on their intuition to
   develop JR schedules which sometimes leads to suboptimal/unwanted
   outcomes. In this article, we propose a generic JR framework, which can
   be used by managers to develop optimal JR schedules in firms across many
   industries, such as IT, manufacturing, banking, medical, construction,
   chemical, aviation, etc. The proposed framework contributes to theory by
   addressing important questions, such as when to implement JR, and how to
   quantify some of its most important impacts. We also demonstrate the
   utility of the proposed framework through an illustrative industrial
   example.

   and medical therapy. In this work, the passive harmonic mode-locked
   (HML) technique is used to realize a HRF fiber laser in GHz level,
   effectively overcoming the limitations of traditional fiber laser
   structures. In order to maximize the advantages of nanomaterials, we
   synthesized high-purity hollow MoS2-Co3S4 heterojunction materials by
   hydrothermal method. Then, a "sandwich" structure saturable absorber
   (SA) was prepared by photodeposition, and its nonlinear optical
   properties were investigated. The results demonstrate that the
   modulation depth and saturation intensity of MoS2-Co3S4 SA are 24 % and
   4.53 MW/cm2, respectively. The fiber laser based on MoS2-Co3S4 SA could
   realize the fundamental frequency mode-locked at 23.11 MHz with a pulse
   width of 0.99 ps. In addition, various high-order HML are realized with
   this laser system capable of stable operation for extended periods up to

   field. This research provides strong support to promote the development
   and commercialization of HRF fiber lasers.

AB Weakly-supervised medical image segmentation methods utilizing
   image-level labels have gained attention for reducing the annotation
   cost. They typically use Class Activation Maps (CAM) from a
   classification network but struggle with incomplete activation regions
   due to low-resolution localization without detailed boundaries.
   Differently from most of them that only focus on improving the quality
   of CAMs, we propose amore unified weakly-supervised segmentation
   framework with image-level supervision. Firstly, an Uncertainty-weighted
   Multi-resolution Class Activation Map (UM-CAM) is proposed to generate
   high-quality pixel-level pseudo-labels. Subsequently, a Geodesic
   distance-based Seed Expansion (GSE) strategy is introduced to rectify
   ambiguous boundaries in the UM-CAM by leveraging contextual information.
   To train a final segmentation model from noisy pseudo-labels, we
   introduce a Random-View Consensus (RVC) training strategy to suppress
   unreliable pixel/voxels and encourage consistency between random-view
   predictions. Extensive experiments on 2D fetal brain segmentation and 3D
   brain tumor segmentation tasks showed that our method significantly
   outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods. Code is available at:

AB Aortic dissection continues to be responsible for significant morbidity
   and mortality, although recent advances in medical data assimilation and
   in experimental and in silico models have improved our understanding of
   the initiation and progression of the accumulation of blood within the
   aortic wall. Hence, there remains a pressing necessity for innovative
   and enhanced models to more accurately characterize the associated
   pathological changes. Early on, experimental models were employed to
   uncover mechanisms in aortic dissection, such as hemodynamic changes and
   alterations in wall microstructure, and to assess the efficacy of
   medical implants. While experimental models were once the only option
   available, more recently they are also being used to validate in silico
   models. Based on an improved understanding of the deteriorated
   microstructure of the aortic wall, numerous multiscale material models
   have been proposed in recent decades to study the state of stress in
   dissected aortas, including the changes associated with damage and
   failure. Furthermore, when integrated with accessible patient-derived
   medical data, in silico models prove to be an invaluable tool for
   identifying correlations between hemodynamics, wall stresses, or
   thrombus formation in the deteriorated aortic wall. They are also
   advantageous for model-guided design of medical implants with the aim of
   evaluating the deployment and migration of implants in patients.
   Nonetheless, the utility of in silico models depends largely on
   patient-derived medical data, such as chosen boundary conditions or
   tissue properties. In this review article, our objective is to provide a
   thorough summary of medical data elucidating the pathological
   alterations associated with this disease. Concurrently, we aim to assess
   experimental models, as well as multiscale material and patient
   data-informed in silico models, that investigate various aspects of
   aortic dissection. In conclusion, we present a discourse on future
   perspectives, encompassing aspects of disease modeling, numerical
   challenges, and clinical applications, with a particular focus on aortic
   dissection. The aspiration is to inspire future studies, deepen our
   comprehension of the disease, and ultimately shape clinical care and
   treatment decisions.

AB Thermal imaging technology presents a promising, non-invasive tool for
   medical diagnostics, particularly in eye health assessment. However,
   accurately delineating the eye region in thermal images of the human
   face remains a significant challenge for temperature analysis.
   Extracting eye temperature information from ocular thermal images has
   traditionally been a manual or semi-automated process, making it
   time-consuming and tedious. Our research aims to address these issues by
   introducing an automated systematic approach to eye segmentation and
   temperature analysis. We employ the semantic segmentation deep learning
   model SegFormer to segment the eye region and a novel method to extract
   the thermal-ocular temperature within this region of interest (ROI) for
   analysis of temperature patterns and diagnosis of any abnormalities. The
   process starts by extracting temperature data from each pixel in the
   thermal images. Using the mask and these temperature values, only the
   temperatures within the masked area are isolated for analysis.
   Validation is done by comparing and calculating the mean square error
   against the manual method. A self-created dataset of thermal images of
   human faces is used due to the lack of available datasets for
   segmentation. SegFormer (B5) achieves a mean intersection over union
   (MIoU) of 0.9178 and a dice coefficient of 0.9299. The extracted
   temperature values from the segmented eye regions provide crucial data
   for assessing eye health and identifying potential abnormalities. This
   methodical approach contributes to the progression of thermal image
   analysis for diagnosing eye-related conditions, particularly in
   ophthalmology, and in medical domains such as fever screening and
   reliable Computer-Aided Diagnosis Systems (CADS).

AB Operational inefficiencies remain a critical occupational burden to
   clinical healthcare workers, contributing to adverse organizational and
   employee outcomes. Perceptions of these inefficiencies likely vary
   across occupational roles, yet these differences have not been
   thoroughly explored in the healthcare setting. To address this gap,
   inefficiencies at work were self-reported by 1083 interdisciplinary
   clinical healthcare workers within a large academic medical center in
   the southeastern United States. A qualitative inductive thematic
   analysis was used to describe employee perceptions of work tasks,
   processes, or systems that seem duplicative, poorly designed, or
   unnecessary. Matrix coding was used to explore differences based on
   professional roles. Specific inefficiencies were differentially
   experienced across professional roles, including but not limited to role
   definition, education, and staffing. The reported differences highlight
   the need to engage with all healthcare workers to enhance the experience
   of all roles across the organization.

AB ObjectivesEndoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a minimally invasive
   treatment for early gastric cancer; additional treatment may be
   recommended for patients in whom resection is not curative per the
   American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines. The aim of
   this study was to assess treatment outcomes of ESD for gastric
   neoplasia, with a focus on cases of non-curative resection.MethodsThis
   was a retrospective study of all individuals undergoing ESD for the
   treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma or dysplasia in a high-volume
   tertiary care center in the United States. Data on patient demographic
   characteristics, clinical history, lesion characteristics, and
   procedural and clinical outcomes were collected from the electronic
   medical record.ResultsAmong 82 cases undergoing ESD for the management
   of gastric neoplasia, 32 cases resulted in non-curative resection. 20 of
   these non-curative cases did not get additional treatment, among which
   recurrence occurred in two cases with positive horizontal margins only.
   These patients did not show lymph node metastasis and underwent further
   endoscopic or surgical resection. There was no recurrence in 11 cases
   with undifferentiated carcinomas of <= 2 cm in size.ConclusionsAlthough
   this study was limited by its retrospective design, small sample size,
   and follow-up duration, our findings suggest that a risk-adapted
   strategy could be employed for certain patients undergoing non-curative
   ESD per American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines, with
   close follow-up instead of routine surgery in select cases with
   favorable features. Further studies are needed to refine the criteria
   for additional treatment after non-curative ESD in Western populations.

AB Accurate prediction of user dropout is crucial for enhancing the
   effectiveness of social care applications developed for the elderly.
   Given the sensitive nature of healthcare data, this study introduces a
   Federated Learning (FL) approach to predict user dropout while
   preserving data privacy by keeping personal data on local devices and
   only sharing model updates. We propose three client selection
   methods-Balanced label distribution, Data-Rich client prioritization,
   and a Combined strategy-that enhance predictive performance,
   computational efficiency,reduce carbon emissions, and decrease training
   duration. Additionally, we evaluate sampling strategies, including
   oversampling, undersampling, and combined over-under sampling, to
   address class imbalance in real-world dataset. Our experimental results
   demonstrate that our FL approach with the Balanced client selection
   method achieves an F1 score of 76.4%, surpassing the traditional
   centralized model by 13.5% and reducing training time and carbon
   emissions by 88.7%. This study underscores the potential of FL combined
   with strategic client selection and sampling methods to improve dropout
   prediction in healthcare applications while preserving privacy and
   promoting environmental sustainability.

AB Background: Despite numerous studies assessing bundled interventions to
   enhance hand hygiene compliance (HHC), compliance rates persist at
   suboptimal levels. Our objective was to employ Kotter's Change Model
   (KCM) to enhance HHC and conduct a comprehensive process evaluation
   among medical staff within the intensive care unit (ICU).<br /> Methods:
   KCM was implemented at the ICU of Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University
   from March 2018 to August 2021, with a 41-month longitudinal monitoring
   of HHC. The primary outcome focused on the absolute monthly change in
   HHC. Secondary outcomes encompassed the HHC characteristics across
   different phases, varying trends in HHC concerning different hand
   hygiene opportunities and occupations, quarterly incidences of central
   line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) and catheter-associated
   urinary tract infections (CAUTI).<br /> Results: This study included
   20,222 hand hygiene actions and 24,195 opportunities. The overall HHC
   was 83.58 % (95 %CI, 83.11 %-84.04 %). Following the KCM implementation,
   HHC surged from 35.71 % (95 % CI, 22.99 %-50.83 %) to 87.75 % (95 % CI,
   85.53 %-89.67 %), reflecting a notable increase of 145.73 %. The most
   rapid growth in HHC occurred post-patient contact, elevating from 35.29
   % to 89.8 %. Despite escalating patient numbers and treatment
   complexities annually, the quarterly rates of CLABSI (0 %o -3.53 %o )
   and CAUTI (0.96 %o-4.26 %o ) remained consistently low. Conclusion:
   Utilizing KCM systematically alters healthcare providers' perception of
   hand hygiene, fostering an environment that advocates for and sustains
   improved HHC among ICU personnel. Implications for clinical practice:
   The Kotter's change model can be an effective framework for healthcare
   organizations to systematically improve and maintain hand hygiene
   compliance among healthcare providers, which can in turn help reduce
   healthcare-associated infections.

AB In this study, we investigated the behavior and emission characteristics
   of Hg across diverse industrial combustion sources, such as coal-fired
   power plants, solid refuse fuel (SRF) power plants, medical waste
   incinerators, and industrial waste incinerators, as well as the
   development of emission factors, Among the facilities, the estimated Hg
   control efficiency was 86% for coal-fired power plants, 69% for SRF
   power plants, and over 95% for medical and industrial waste
   incinerators. The oxidation and regulation of elemental Hg (Hg0) are
   considered important factors in reducing Hg air emissions, with the flue
   gas HCl concentration being the primary factor affecting Hg oxidation.
   Particulate Hg was mainly controlled in the electrostatic precipitator
   (ESP) at the power plant, effectively capturing dust particles ranging
   from 10 to 100 mu m. The emission factors estimated by measuring stack
   flue gas exhibited their highest values at SRF power plants, with an
   estimated average of 127 +/- 25 mg/ton, while the lowest values were
   observed for industrial waste incinerators, with an average of 2.5 +/-
   0.3 mg/ton. This study is significant in that it provides a comparative
   analysis of various real industrial cases, and the Hg emission factors
   are expected to offer valuable data for estimating future national Hg
   air emissions.

   toreduce carbon emissions and separate medical waste. Methods:
   Twenty-five patients who performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy from March
   to May 2024 were included in this study. Four sections of the isolation
   gowns (anterior, posterior, right, and left) were cut in to 2 cm(2)after
   endoscopy, and the rate of microbial contamination was examined using
   the stamp method.<br /> Results: The endoscopic examination time was 8
   min (6-12),and endoscopy was performed by 10 expert endoscopists, six
   endoscopists, and nine residents. The overall isolation gown
   contamination rate was 56%, with 25%,20.8%, 20.8%, and 33.3% in the
   front, back, as well as right and left arms, respectively. The rates of
   isolation gown contamination rates in the expert endoscopists,
   endoscopists, and residents groups were 30%, 50%, and77.8%,
   respectively, with a higher rate in the residents group. Regardless
   ofthe physician's performance, bacterial detection was consistently
   higher in the left arm (42.9% vs.40% vs.25%;p=0.093).The detected
   bacteria comprised58% Gram-positive and 42% Gram-negative organisms
   ,including those from tap water used for endoscopy bacteria and obtained
   from the participant's skin or mouth. No pathogenic organisms were
   detected.<br /> Conclusions: The bacteria detected in disposable gowns
   after gastrointestinal endoscopy were non-pathogenic. Thus, our findings
   suggest that changing all personal protective equipment of respective
   endoscopes might not be essential. We advocate for green endoscopy to
   achieve sustainable development goals and reduce medical waste.K

AB Although per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been frequently
   linked to cardiovascular and renal disease separately, evidence remains
   scarce regarding their systematic effect. Therefore, we recruited 546
   newly diagnosed acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients and detected
   seven myocardial enzymes and six kidney function biomarkers. Twelve PFAS
   were also assessed with ultra-high-performance liquid
   chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Generalized linear model and
   restricted cubic spline model were applied to single pollutant analysis.
   Quantile g-computation was used for mixture analysis. Network model was
   utilized to identify central and bridge nodes of pollutants and
   phenotypes. In the present study, perfluorohexane sulfonic acid was
   positively associated with uric acid (UA) (beta= 0.04, 95% confidence
   interval (CI): 0.01, 0.07), and perfluorobutanoic acid was negatively
   associated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (beta= -0.04, 95%
   CI: -0.07, -0.01) but positively associated with UA (beta= 0.03, 95% CI:
   0.01, 0.06). In mixture analysis, each quantile increase in the PFAS
   mixture was significantly associated with UA (beta= 0.08, 95% CI: 0.04,
   0.11). Network analysis revealed that perfluorooctanoate, UA, and
   myoglobin were denoted as bridge nodes, and the first principal
   component of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase- myocardial band
   was identified as the node with the highest strength and expected
   influence. This study investigates the systematic impact of PFAS
   exposure through cardiorenal interaction network, which highlights that
   PFAS may serve as an upstream approach in UA-modulated cardiorenal
   network to affect cardiorenal system comprehensively.

AB Epilepsy is a severe, relapsing, and multifactorial neurological
   disorder. Studies regarding the accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and
   in-depth pathogenesis are crucial for the precise and effective
   treatment of epilepsy. The pathogenesis of epilepsy is complex and
   involves alterations in variables such as gene expression, protein
   expression, ion channel activity, energy metabolites, and gut microbiota
   composition. Satisfactory results are lacking for conventional
   treatments for epilepsy. Surgical resection of lesions, drug therapy,
   and non-drug interventions are mainly used in clinical practice to treat
   pain associated with epilepsy. Non-pharmacological treatments, such as a
   ketogenic diet, gene therapy for nerve regeneration, and neural
   regulation, are currently areas of research focus. This review provides
   a comprehensive overview of the pathogenesis, diagnostic methods, and
   treatments of epilepsy. It also elaborates on the theoretical basis,
   treatment modes, and effects of invasive nerve stimulation in
   neurotherapy, including percutaneous vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain
   electrical stimulation, repetitive nerve electrical stimulation, in
   addition to non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation and
   transcranial direct current stimulation. Numerous studies have shown
   that electromagnetic stimulation-mediated neuromodulation therapy can
   markedly improve neurological function and reduce the frequency of
   epileptic seizures. Additionally, many new technologies for the
   diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy are being explored. However, current
   research is mainly focused on analyzing patients' clinical
   manifestations and exploring relevant diagnostic and treatment methods
   to study the pathogenesis at a molecular level, which has led to a lack
   of consensus regarding the mechanisms related to the disease.

AB Aneurysm rupture can result in subarachnoid hemorrhage, a condition with
   potentially severe consequences, such as disability and death. In the
   acute stage, early brain injury manifests as intracranial pressure
   elevation, global cerebral ischemia, acute hydrocephalus, and direct
   blood-brain contact due to aneurysm rupture. This may subsequently cause
   delayed cerebral infarction, often with cerebral vasospasm,
   significantly affecting patient outcomes. Chronic complications such as
   brain volume loss and chronic hydrocephalus can further impact outcomes.
   Investigating the mechanisms of subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced brain
   injury is paramount for identifying effective treatments. Stem cell
   therapy, with its multipotent differentiation capacity and
   anti-inflammatory effects, has emerged as a promising approach for
   treating previously deemed incurable conditions. This review focuses on
   the potential application of stem cells in subarachnoid hemorrhage
   pathology and explores their role in neurogenesis and as a therapeutic
   intervention in preclinical and clinical subarachnoid hemorrhage
   studies.

AB Traumatic brain injury is a global health crisis, causing significant
   death and disability worldwide. Neuroinflammation that follows traumatic
   brain injury has serious consequences for neuronal survival and
   cognitive impairments, with astrocytes involved in this response.
   Following traumatic brain injury, astrocytes rapidly become reactive,
   and astrogliosis propagates from the injury core to distant brain
   regions. Homeostatic astroglial proteins are downregulated near the
   traumatic brain injury core, while pro-inflammatory astroglial genes are
   overexpressed. This altered gene expression is considered a pathological
   remodeling of astrocytes that produces serious consequences for neuronal
   survival and cognitive recovery. In addition, glial scar formed by
   reactive astrocytes is initially necessary to limit immune cell
   infiltration, but in the long term impedes axonal reconnection and
   functional recovery. Current therapeutic strategies for traumatic brain
   injury are focused on preventing acute complications. Statins,
   cannabinoids, progesterone, beta-blockers, and cerebrolysin demonstrate
   neuroprotective benefits but most of them have not been studied in the
   context of astrocytes. In this review, we discuss the cell signaling
   pathways activated in reactive astrocytes following traumatic brain
   injury and we discuss some of the potential new strategies aimed to
   modulate astroglial responses in traumatic brain injury, especially
   using cell-targeted strategies with miRNAs or lncRNA, viral vectors, and
   repurposed drugs.

AB With the rapidly aging human population, age-related cognitive decline
   and dementia are becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. Aging is
   considered the main risk factor for cognitive decline and acts through
   alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota, microbial
   metabolites, and the functions of astrocytes. The microbiota-gut-brain
   axis has been the focus of multiple studies and is closely associated
   with cognitive function. This article provides a comprehensive review of
   the specific changes that occur in the composition of the gut microbiota
   and microbial metabolites in older individuals and discusses how the
   aging of astrocytes and reactive astrocytosis are closely related to
   age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. This
   article also summarizes the gut microbiota components that affect
   astrocyte function, mainly through the vagus nerve, immune responses,
   circadian rhythms, and microbial metabolites. Finally, this article
   summarizes the mechanism by which the gut microbiota-astrocyte axis
   plays a role in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Our findings have
   revealed the critical role of the microbiota-astrocyte axis in
   age-related cognitive decline, aiding in a deeper understanding of
   potential gut microbiome-based adjuvant therapy strategies for this
   condition.

AB PrPSc, a misfolded, aggregation-prone isoform of the cellular prion
   protein (PrP (c)), is the infectious prion agent responsible for fatal
   neurodegenerative diseases of humans and other mammals. PrPSc can adopt
   different pathogenic conformations (prion strains), which can be
   resistant to potential drugs, or acquire drug resistance, posing
   challenges for the development of effective therapies. Since PrP (c) is
   the obligate precursor of any prion strain and serves as the mediator of
   prion neurotoxicity, it represents an attractive therapeutic target for
   prion diseases. In this minireview, we briefly outline the approaches to
   target PrP (c) and discuss our recent identification of Zn(II)-BnPyP, a
   PrP (c)-targeting porphyrin with an unprecedented bimodal mechanism of
   action. We argue that in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanism
   by which Zn(II)-BnPyP targets PrP (c) may lead toward the development of
   a new class of dual mechanism anti-prion compounds.

AB Cholesterol is an important component of plasma membranes and
   participates in many basic life functions, such as the maintenance of
   cell membrane stability, the synthesis of steroid hormones, and
   myelination. Cholesterol plays a key role in the establishment and
   maintenance of the central nervous system. The brain contains 20% of the
   whole body's cholesterol, 80% of which is located within myelin. A huge
   number of processes (e.g., the sterol regulatory element-binding protein
   pathway and liver X receptor pathway) participate in the regulation of
   cholesterol metabolism in the brain via mechanisms that include
   cholesterol biosynthesis, intracellular transport, and efflux. Certain
   brain injuries or diseases involving crosstalk among the processes above
   can affect normal cholesterol metabolism to induce detrimental
   consequences. Therefore, we hypothesized that cholesterol-related
   molecules and pathways can serve as therapeutic targets for central
   nervous system diseases. Intracerebral hemorrhage is the most severe
   hemorrhagic stroke subtype, with high mortality and morbidity.
   Historical cholesterol levels are associated with the risk of
   intracerebral hemorrhage. Moreover, secondary pathological changes after
   intracerebral hemorrhage are associated with cholesterol metabolism
   dysregulation, such as neuroinflammation, demyelination, and multiple
   types of programmed cell death. Intracellular cholesterol accumulation
   in the brain has been found after intracerebral hemorrhage. In this
   paper, we review normal cholesterol metabolism in the central nervous
   system, the mechanisms known to participate in the disturbance of
   cholesterol metabolism after intracerebral hemorrhage, and the links
   between cholesterol metabolism and cell death. We also review several
   possible and constructive therapeutic targets identified based on
   cholesterol metabolism to provide cholesterol-based perspectives and a
   reference for those interested in the treatment of intracerebral
   hemorrhage.

AB Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cell in the central
   nervous system. Upon injury and inflammation, astrocytes become reactive
   and undergo morphological and functional changes. Depending on their
   phenotypic classification as A1 or A2, reactive astrocytes contribute to
   both neurotoxic and neuroprotective responses, respectively. However,
   this binary classification does not fully capture the diversity of
   astrocyte responses observed across different diseases and injuries.
   Transcriptomic analysis has revealed that reactive astrocytes have a
   complex landscape of gene expression profiles, which emphasizes the
   heterogeneous nature of their reactivity. Astrocytes actively
   participate in regulating central nervous system inflammation by
   interacting with microglia and other cell types, releasing cytokines,
   and influencing the immune response. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase
   (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway is a central player in
   astrocyte reactivity and impacts various aspects of astrocyte behavior,
   as evidenced by in silico, in vitro, and in vivo results. In astrocytes,
   inflammatory cues trigger a cascade of molecular events, where nuclear
   factor-kappa B serves as a central mediator of the pro-inflammatory
   responses. Here, we review the heterogeneity of reactive astrocytes and
   the molecular mechanisms underlying their activation. We highlight the
   involvement of various signaling pathways that regulate astrocyte
   reactivity, including the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),
   alpha v beta 3 integrin/PI3K/AKT/connexin 43, and Notch/PI3K/AKT
   pathways. While targeting the inactivation of the PI3K/AKT cellular
   signaling pathway to control reactive astrocytes and prevent central
   nervous system damage, evidence suggests that activating this pathway
   could also yield beneficial outcomes. This dual function of the PI3K/AKT
   pathway underscores its complexity in astrocyte reactivity and brain
   function modulation. The review emphasizes the importance of employing
   astrocyte-exclusive models to understand their functions accurately and
   these models are essential for clarifying astrocyte behavior. The
   findings should then be validated using in vivo models to ensure
   real-life relevance. The review also highlights the significance of
   PI3K/AKT pathway modulation in preventing central nervous system damage,
   although further studies are required to fully comprehend its role due
   to varying factors such as different cell types, astrocyte responses to
   inflammation, and disease contexts. Specific strategies are clearly
   necessary to address these variables effectively.

AB Spinal cord injuries impose a notably economic burden on society, mainly
   because of the severe after-effects they cause. Despite the ongoing
   development of various therapies for spinal cord injuries, their
   effectiveness remains unsatisfactory. However, a deeper understanding of
   metabolism has opened up a new therapeutic opportunity in the form of
   metabolic reprogramming. In this review, we explore the metabolic
   changes that occur during spinal cord injuries, their consequences, and
   the therapeutic tools available for metabolic reprogramming. Normal
   spinal cord metabolism is characterized by independent cellular
   metabolism and intercellular metabolic coupling. However, spinal cord
   injury results in metabolic disorders that include disturbances in
   glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction.
   These metabolic disturbances lead to corresponding pathological changes,
   including the failure of axonal regeneration, the accumulation of
   scarring, and the activation of microglia. To rescue spinal cord injury
   at the metabolic level, potential metabolic reprogramming approaches
   have emerged, including replenishing metabolic substrates,
   reconstituting metabolic couplings, and targeting mitochondrial
   therapies to alter cell fate. The available evidence suggests that
   metabolic reprogramming holds great promise as a next-generation
   approach for the treatment of spinal cord injury. To further advance the
   metabolic treatment of the spinal cord injury, future efforts should
   focus on a deeper understanding of neurometabolism, the development of
   more advanced metabolomics technologies, and the design of highly
   effective metabolic interventions.

AB Copper is a transition metal and an essential element for the organism,
   as alterations in its homeostasis leading to metal accumulation or
   deficiency have pathological effects in several organs, including the
   central nervous system. Central copper dysregulations have been
   evidenced in two genetic disorders characterized by mutations in the
   copper-ATPases ATP7A and ATP7B, Menkes disease and Wilson's disease,
   respectively, and also in multifactorial neurological disorders such as
   Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
   and multiple sclerosis. This review summarizes current knowledge about
   the role of copper in central nervous system physiology and pathology,
   reports about unbalances in copper levels and/or distribution under
   disease, describes relevant animal models for human disorders where
   copper metabolism genes are dysregulated, and discusses relevant
   therapeutic approaches modulating copper availability. Overall,
   alterations in copper metabolism may contribute to the etiology of
   central nervous system disorders and represent relevant therapeutic
   targets to restore tissue homeostasis.

AB Schwann cells are essential for the maintenance and function of motor
   neurons, axonal networks, and the neuromuscular junction. In amyotrophic
   lateral sclerosis, where motor neuron function is progressively lost,
   Schwann cell function may also be impaired. Recently, important
   signaling and potential trophic activities of Schwann cell-derived
   exosomal vesicles have been reported. This case report describes the
   treatment of a patient with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using
   serial intravenous infusions of allogeneic Schwann cell-derived exosomal
   vesicles, marking, to our knowledge, the first instance of such
   treatment. An 81-year-old male patient presented with a 1.5-year history
   of rapidly progressive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. After initial
   diagnosis, the patient underwent a combination of generic riluzole,
   sodium phenylbutyrate for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis, and taurursodiol. The patient volunteered to participate in
   an FDA-approved single-patient expanded access treatment and received
   weekly intravenous infusions of allogeneic Schwann cell-derived exosomal
   vesicles to potentially restore impaired Schwann cell and motor neuron
   function. We confirmed that cultured Schwann cells obtained from the
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient via sural nerve biopsy appeared
   impaired (senescent) and that exposure of the patient's Schwann cells to
   allogeneic Schwann cell-derived exosomal vesicles, cultured expanded
   from a cadaver donor improved their growth capacity in vitro. After a
   period of observation lasting 10 weeks, during which amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised and pulmonary function were
   regularly monitored, the patient received weekly consecutive infusions
   of 1.54 x 1012 (x2), and then consecutive infusions of 7.5 x 1012 (x6)
   allogeneic Schwann cell-derived exosomal vesicles diluted in 40 mL of
   Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. None of the infusions were
   associated with adverse events such as infusion reactions (allergic or
   otherwise) or changes in vital signs. Clinical lab serum neurofilament
   and cytokine levels measured prior to each infusion varied somewhat
   without a clear trend. A more sensitive in-house assay suggested
   possible inflammasome activation during the disease course. A trend for
   clinical stabilization was observed during the infusion period. Our
   study provides a novel approach to address impaired Schwann cells and
   possibly motor neuron function in patients with amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis using allogeneic Schwann cell-derived exosomal vesicles.
   Initial findings suggest that this approach is safe.

AB Objectives: We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to
   assess the value of image-enhanced endoscopy including blue laser
   imaging (BLI), linked color imaging, narrow-band imaging (NBI), and
   texture and color enhancement imaging to detect and diagnose gastric
   cancer (GC) compared to that of white-light imaging (WLI). Methods:
   Studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified through PubMed,
   Cochrane Library, and Japan Medical Abstracts Society databases
   searches. The pooled risk ratio for dichotomous variables was calculated
   using the random-effects model to assess the GC detection between WLI
   and image-enhanced endoscopy. A random-effects model was used to
   calculate the overall diagnostic performance of WLI and magnifying
   image-enhanced endoscopy for GC. Results: Sixteen studies met the
   inclusion criteria. The detection rate of GC was significantly improved
   in linked color imaging compared with that in WLI (risk ratio, 2.20; 95%
   confidence interval [CI], 1.39-3.25; p < 0.01) with mild heterogeneity.
   Magnifying endoscopy with NBI (ME-NBI) obtained a pooled sensitivity,
   specificity, and area under the summary receiver operating curve of 0.84
   (95 % CI, 0.80-0.88), 0.96 (95 % CI, 0.94-0.97), and 0.92, respectively.
   Similarly, ME-BLI showed a pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area
   under the curve of 0.81 (95 % CI, 0.77-0.85), 0.85 (95 % CI, 0.82-0.88),
   and 0.95, respectively. The diagnostic efficacy of ME-NBI/BLI for GC was
   evidently high compared to that of WLI, However, significant
   heterogeneity among the NBI studies still existed. Conclusions: Our
   meta-analysis showed a high detection rate for linked color imaging and
   a high diagnostic performance of ME-NBI/BLI for GC compared to that with
   WLI.

AB The general principles of gastrointestinal endoscopy training in the
   United States were formulated and summarized more than a decade ago and
   the principles have been consistent until now. To summarize, trainees
   should be prepared to (i) appropriately recommend endoscopic procedures
   as indicated by the findings of the consultative evaluation, with an
   explicit understanding of accepted specific indications,
   contraindications, and diagnostic/therapeutic alternatives, (ii) perform
   procedures safely, completely, and expeditiously, including possessing a
   thorough understanding of the principles of conscious sedation/analgesia
   techniques, the use of anesthesia-assisted sedation where appropriate,
   and pre-procedure clinical assessment and patient monitoring, (iii)
   correctly interpret endoscopic findings and integrate them into medical
   or endoscopic therapy, (iv) identify risk factors for each procedure,
   understand how to minimize each, and recognize and appropriately manage
   complications when they occur, (v) acknowledge the limitations of
   endoscopic procedures and personal skills and know when to request help,
   and (vi) understand the principles of quality measurement and
   improvement. This article provides an overview of the endoscopy training
   system and structure, evaluation scheme, and competence and

AB Objectives: Black spots (BSs) are lentiginous findings observed in the
   gastric body and fundus during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and are
   predominantly seen in patients undergoing Helicobacter pylori
   eradication treatment. However, the detailed patient background and
   exact composition are poorly understood. This study aims to clarify the
   clinicopathological features of BSs, examine patient demographics, and
   use the NanoSuit-correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) method
   combined with scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray
   spectroscopy for elemental analysis. Methods: Patients who underwent
   upper gastrointestinal endoscopy between 2017 and 2022 were included.
   Data on age, medications, blood tests, and H. pylori infection status
   were retrospectively gathered from medical records. Univariate analysis
   was conducted to examine BS presence, with results then used in a
   multivariate model to identify associated risk factors. Additionally,
   pathological specimens from patients with BSs were analyzed for
   elemental composition using the NanoSuit-CLEM method combined with
   scanning electronmicroscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.
   Results: An analysis of 6778 cases identified risk factors for BSs,
   including older age and using proton pump inhibitors, statins,
   corticosteroids, and antithrombotic drugs. Endoscopically, BSs
   correlated with higher gastric atrophy and lower active H. pylori
   infection. Iron deposition at BS sites was specifically identified using
   NanoSuit-CLEM. Conclusions: BSs on gastrointestinal endoscopy may
   indicate an absence of active H. pylori inflammation. The discovery of
   iron deposition within BSs using the NanoSuit-CLEM method has offered
   new insights into the possible causative factors and advances our
   understanding of the etiology of BSs, bringing us closer to unraveling
   the underlying mechanisms of their formation.

AB Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor (PEComa) is a rare mesenchymal
   tumor. Some papers have reported that colonoscopy could be used to treat
   PEComa with a predominantly pedunculated polyp, whereas surgical
   intervention is often required for cases with submucosal-type tumors.
   These findings suggest that the morphology of PEComa changes
   dramatically with disease progression. Because of the rapid progression
   of PEComa, endoscopic treatment remains challenging, and early-stage
   PEComa morphology is not well understood. A 64-year-old man presented to
   our hospital for a follow-up colonoscopy after undergoing multiple
   polypectomies. He had a medical history of colorectal adenoma and
   prostate cancer. A 4-mm pale blue elevated but not pedunculated lesion
   was observed in the transverse colon, an area where he had not had
   polyps previously. Since no epithelial change was observed, the presence
   of a submucosal tumor, such as a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, was
   suspected. Cold snare polypectomy was performed, and the lesion was
   completely resected. Histological evaluation using hematoxylin and eosin
   staining identified that the submucosal tumor included thickened
   vascular walls and adipose tissue. Although fragmented due to
   significant degeneration, spindle-shaped cells staining positive for
   smooth muscle actin were observed within and surrounding the
   unstructured hyalinized tissue with calcifications. Based on these
   findings, the lesion was diagnosed as angiomyolipoma, a subtype of
   PEComa. Complete resection was confirmed by histopathology. To our
   knowledge, this PEComa is the smallest of any PEComa reported in the
   literature. Our finding provides valuable insights into the very early
   stage of colorectal PEComas.

AB ObjectivesThis study aimed to determine the impact of the coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the treatment of acute cholangitis
   caused by choledocholithiasis.MethodsThe Japanese government declared a
   state of emergency in April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We
   retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 309 patients who
   underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for
   acute cholangitis caused by choledocholithiasis between April 2017 and
   December 2022.ResultsPatients were categorized into a pregroup (n = 134)
   and a postgroup (n = 175), depending on whether they were diagnosed
   before or after the state of emergency declaration. The total number of
   ERCP cases and the number of ERCP cases with endoscopic stone removals
   increased after the state of emergency declaration. Compared with the
   pregroup, the numbers of patients with performance status of 0-1 and
   surgically altered anatomy increased, whereas the numbers of patients
   taking oral antiplatelets or anticoagulants and those with
   cerebrovascular disease decreased in the postgroup. The number of
   single-stage endoscopic stone removals increased and hospital stays were
   significantly shorter in the postgroup. No differences in adverse event
   rates were detected between the two groups.ConclusionsAlthough our
   hospital provides tertiary care, the number of patients with cholangitis
   in good general condition and no underlying disease increased after the
   state of emergency declaration. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an
   increase in the number of single-stage endoscopic treatments and
   shortened hospital stays for patients with acute cholangitis caused by
   choledocholithiasis. No safety issues with ERCP were detected, even
   during the pandemic.

AB Large ileal lipomas over 2 cm can cause symptoms, that may require a
   resection. Due to the narrow lumen and thin walls of the ileum,
   endoscopic treatments can have a high risk of adverse events and require
   technical expertise, thus surgical resection is currently the mainstay
   of treatment. To overcome the technical challenges, we developed a novel
   method to endoscopically resect terminal ileal lipomas. The technique
   involves extracting the lesion into the cecum, which creates sufficient
   space to maneuver, and a better field of view. The lipoma is resected
   with endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection.
   The appearance of the lipoma protruding out of the ileocecal valve
   resembles that of a tongue sticking out of the mouth, thus we named this
   the "tongue out technique". To assess the technical feasibility of this
   method, we retrospectively analyzed seven cases of terminal ileal lipoma
   that were endoscopically resected using the "tongue out technique" at
   NTT Medical Center Tokyo between January 2017 and October 2023.
   Technical success was 100% and en bloc resection was achieved in all
   cases. The median size was 31 (14-55) mm. Three cases were resected with
   endoscopic mucosal resection while endoscopic submucosal dissection was
   performed on the other four cases. There was one case of delayed
   post-endoscopic mucosal resection bleeding, which was caused by clip
   dislodgement. There were no perforations. No recurrence of the lipoma or
   associated symptoms have been observed. This new technique can allow
   more ileal lipomas to be treated with minimally invasive and
   organ-preserving endoscopic procedures.

AB Medicines are complex products. In addition to the drug (a molecule
   which causes a pharmacological effect in the body), they also contain a
   number of other ingredients (excipients). These are added for a variety
   of reasons (e.g. to ensure stability or to target the drug to a
   particular part of the body). A very careful assessment is required to
   prepare a potent and safe medicine.  New types of drug molecule are
   being devised rapidly and have the potential to transform patients'
   lives. However, there is a long time-lag (10 - 15 years) between the
   discovery of a new drug and its translation into a medicine. Most of
   this time is taken up by developing a suitable &quot;formulation&quot;
   (drug + excipients) and then testing this. There are very significant
   benefits that would be realised from accelerating the process: this was
   made clear by the COVID-19 pandemic, in which the rapid development of
   vaccines led to millions of lives being saved, and is particularly
   important as society ages and patients live for prolonged periods of
   time with multiple conditions.  The UK traditionally has been a
   powerhouse for medicines discovery, and the medical technology and
   pharmaceutical sector is still a vital part of the economy. However,
   productivity has recently declined, and compared to peer countries the
   UK has a lack of high-innovation firms. If medicines development can be
   accelerated in the UK, there will be huge economic and societal
   benefits, in addition to profound improvements to the lives of
   individual patients.  To realise this ambition, the UK pharmaceutical
   sector needs highly-trained, doctoral-level, scientists with the skills
   required to accelerate research programmes in medicines development. The
   Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Accelerated Medicines Design &
   Development seeks to meet this user need, by building a cohort of
   innovators and future leaders. We will do this between two universities
   and in collaboration with a network of industrial and clinical partners
   from across the UK pharmaceutical, healthcare and medical technologies
   sector.  Comprehensive science training will enable our students to
   develop the high-level laboratory and computational skills needed to
   overcome the major challenges in medicines development. Our alumni will
   be expert practitioners at integrating lab and digital research,
   recognised by industry as crucial to accelerate medicines development.
   Our students will receive extensive transferable skills training,
   ensuring that they graduate with high-level teamworking, communication,
   leadership and entrepreneurial skills. We will foster an open and
   supportive environment in which students can challenge ideas,
   experiment, and learn from mistakes. Equality, diversity and
   inclusiveness, sustainability, and responsible innovation will be at the
   heart of the CDT, and embedded throughout our training.  By liaising
   closely with industry and clinical partners, we will ensure that the
   research undertaken in the CDT is directly relevant to the most
   significant current challenges in medicines development. We will further
   embed interactions with patients to ensure that the products are
   acceptable to both patients and clinicians. This will allow us to
   directly contribute to the acceleration of medicines development, and
   ultimately will deliver major benefits to patients as new products come
   on to the market.   Our graduates will join companies across the
   pharmaceutical, medical technology and healthcare fields, where they
   will innovate and drive forward research programmes to accelerate
   medicines development for a broad range of diseases. They will ensure
   that new therapies come to market and the health and well-being of
   individuals across the world is improved. Others will enter academia,
   training the next generation. Our alumni will seed a future landscape in
   which medicines are designed and manufactured in a manner which protects
   our environment, and in which there is equality of opportunity for all.

AB Background: Periodontology is most versatile and technique sensitive
   branch that deals with the tissues surrounding the teeth. Like other
   dental specialities periodontics is lacking its entity among general
   population. So, the present study is aimed to evaluate the awareness of
   general public of Srikakulam district in regards to periodontics as a
   speciality in dentistry. Methods: Present cross sectional survey
   evaluated 2,058 questionnaires proforma's using 10 questions. Chisquare
   test was performed to assess the association with age and gender wise
   distribution. While Fischer exact test was performed to know who a
   periodontist was and what he does. Study was performed during January
   1st 2023 to June 31st 2023. Questionnaires were distributed to
   participants and after 10 minutes they were returned. Subjects having
   >20 years age, interested to participate in the study were included and
   subjects who were not interested, dentists, all speciality dental
   practitioners, students pursuing dentistry as profession, dental
   hygienists and dental health care workers were excluded from the study.
   Results: Reveals 38.8% population had gum problems, lower percentages of
   15.8% (P=0.20) of study population has higher level of awareness
   regarding periodontics as a separate specialty, who a periodontist was,
   what he does. For gender wise distribution females have much awareness
   than males but values were non-significant (P=0.20). While opting what a
   periodontist does, 59.1% (P<0.001) population opted for flap surgeries
   and implants, 33.7% never visited a periodontist, 54.5% reported no
   dental problems, degree and post-graduate people had a lesser
   percentages higher level of awareness with no significance (P=0.17).
   Regarding age variation 21-30 years group has shown higher level of
   awareness (19.9%). Further medicos had a higher significant level
   (P<0.001) of awareness than non-medicos. Conclusions: Present study
   concluded a low percentages of high level awareness for periodontics a
   specialty in dentistry, who a periodontist was and what he does
   indicating a lack of knowledge regarding the speciality in Srikakulam
   population. It is our responsibility to educate people regarding our
   speciality for interdisciplinary approach among people as well as

AB Background: Multiple cases of ischemic optic neuropathy following
   infection from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV-2) have been documented. The most described entity is anterior
   ischemic optic neuropathy, although rare cases of posterior ischemic
   optic neuropathy have been reported, mostly in the setting of severe
   disease. We present the first report of posterior ischemic optic
   neuropathy involving both eyes and following uncomplicated coronavirus
   disease 2019 (COVID-19). Relevant literature is analyzed and discussed.
   Case Description: A 65-year-old man presented with severe painless
   visual loss beginning in the lower hemifield of the right eye and
   involving both eyes in the span of 24 hours. Visual acuity in the right
   eye was reduced to no light perception and to uncertain light perception
   in the left eye. He had recently recovered from COVID-19 which had
   manifested with mild respiratory symptoms that did not require medical
   treatment. Complete ophthalmological evaluation revealed no anomalies
   except for non-reactive pupils. As radiological investigations including
   contrast magnetic resonance and computer tomography did not reveal acute
   events bilateral posterior ischemic optic neuropathy was hypothesized.
   As giant cell arteritis is an important cause of sequential ischemic
   neuropathy, high dose steroid treatment was carried out until temporal
   biopsy ruled out vasculitis. Steroid treatment was then slowly tapered
   over the course of 45 days. The patient had a history of carotid stroke
   and thrombophilia and blood pressure monitoring after the event revealed
   hypotensive episodes which led to the suspension of antihypertensive
   medication. At one-month follow-up, a slight improvement in visual
   functioning was observed, with the patient being able to count fingers
   with both eyes. This improvement was confirmed at two months. Fundus
   examination revealed pale optic discs, which confirmed the diagnosis of
   posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Conclusions: COVID-19 can induce
   vascular occlusion through endothelial dysfunction. Additionally, we
   propose that lowering of systemic blood pressure, as reported following
   infection, might also contribute to or even instigate optic nerve
   ischemia.

AB Background: Canadian medical school curricula have traditionally been
   limited in their exposure to ophthalmology. A Medical Student Symposium
   (MSS) was developed to introduce students to the specialty, teach
   clinical skills, and help students to seek future opportunities within
   ophthalmology. Our aim is to provide a model for other specialties to
   meet the evolving and diverse educational needs of medical trainees.
   Methods: Medical students were invited to participate in a 3-hour free
   in-person symposium held at the Canadian Ophthalmological Society (COS)
   Annual Meeting in June 2023. The symposium was divided into three
   sections: a 30-minute keynote speaking session, hands-on workshops, and
   resident mentoring sessions. A cross-sectional quality improvement
   survey was administered to medical students who attended. Descriptive
   statistics were used to analyze the survey responses. Results: In total,
   70 participants attended the symposium. Of these, 61 participants
   (87.1%) responded to the survey. The majority of attendees (67.8%) of
   participants expressed that attending the COS MSS would enhance their
   applications to ophthalmology residency. With regards to knowledge
   acquisition, 85.3% and 75.4% of students noted that the MSS improved
   their didactic and procedural knowledge of ophthalmology, respectively.
   An overwhelming majority of attendees (95.1%) stated they would
   recommend the COS MSS to medical students interested in ophthalmology,
   and 91.6% noted they would attend again. Conclusions: Our study
   demonstrated that a MSS is a valuable platform to enhance medical
   students' exposure and knowledge of the field of ophthalmology. The MSS
   model can be applied as a novel medical education opportunity to
   increase exposure to medical specialties and inclusion of junior
   trainees at national conferences.

AB The diagnosis, treatment, and management of dementia provide significant
   challenges due to its chronic cognitive impairment. The complexity of
   this condition is further highlighted by the impact of gene -environment
   interactions. A recent strategy combines advanced genomics and precision
   medicine methods to explore the complex genetic foundations of dementia.
   Utilizing the most recent research in the field of neurogenetics, the
   importance of precise genetic data in explaining the variation seen in
   dementia patients can be investigated. Gene -environment interactions
   are important because they influence genetic susceptibilities and aid in
   the development and progression of dementia. Modified to each patient's
   genetic profile, precision medicine has the potential to detect groups
   at risk and make previously unheard-of predictions about the course of
   diseases. Precision medicine techniques have the potential to completely
   transform treatment and diagnosis methods. Targeted medications that
   target genetic abnormalities will probably appear, providing the
   possibility for more efficient and customized medical interventions.
   Investigating the relationship between genes and the environment may
   lead to preventive measures that would enable people to change their
   surroundings and minimize the risk of dementia, leading to the improved
   lifestyle of affected people. This paper provides a comprehensive
   overview of the genomic insights into dementia, emphasizing the pivotal
   role of precision medicine, and gene -environment interactions.

AB Artificial sweeteners (ASs) and dyes are widely used in foods, beverages
   and pharmaceutical and are recognized as emerging environmental
   contaminants due to their persistence and widespread occurrence. These
   substances often pass through the human body unchanged and resist
   wastewater treatment processes, leading to continuous introduction into
   aquatic environments and potential long-lasting term environmental
   effects. This study investigated, for the first time, the
   biodegradability of nine commercial dietary supplements, both natural
   and those containing ASs and synthetic dyes, using the Organisation for
   Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 301 F ready biodegradation
   test (RBT), which is a respirometry-manometric method. While the
   products showed good biodegradability, those containing ASs and dyes
   were further studied to determine their fate at the end of the RBT. The
   study involved developing and validating a chromatographic method to
   quantitatively determine the presence of Acesulfame K (1), Sucralose
   (2), Tartrazine (3) and Carmoisine (4) in the RBT mineral medium, using
   ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with two
   detectors: a high-resolution mass-spectrometer with quadrupole
   time-of-flight (qToF) and a UV-Vis diode array detector (DAD). Results
   indicated that these additives were not readily biodegraded,
   highlighting a potential significant environmental concern. This issue
   extends beyond dietary supplements to all Pharmaceutical and Personal
   Care Products (PPCP) including drugs and medical devices. The findings
   underscore the importance of raising cultural awareness about the
   environmental impact of persistent substances, encouraging the
   healthcare chain and patients to make informed choices. From a One
   Health perspective, reducing environmental contamination can lead to
   positive outcomes for human health.

AB Our previous study on plant oil substitution for fish oil found that
   corn oil induced inflammatory responses in grouper, while olive oil was
   effective in anti-inflammatory and immune enhancing. As a vital active
   ingredient in olive oil, squalene has been widely studied for its
   antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, the present
   study was designed to use corn oil as the main lipid source to create a
   model of inflammation or low immunity and investigate the regulatory
   effect of squalene on the immunity of grouper, and to perform hepatic
   transcriptomic and metabolomic assays of grouper using omics technology,
   with the aim of providing basic data for the study of the mechanism of
   squalene. The results showed: squalene ingestion did not affect the
   growth performance of grouper (P > 0.05) but significantly improved
   immunity and the resistance of grouper to Vibrio harveyi (P < 0.05).
   Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses showed that squalene activated
   the Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling pathway and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.
   Western blot results showed that squalene ingestion significantly
   upregulated Wnt/beta-Catenin protein expression and downregulated the
   Axin protein expression (P < 0.05). Above results demonstrated that
   squalene enhanced immunity and disease resistance in grouper may be
   related to the activation of PI3K-Akt/Wnt/beta-Catenin signaling
   pathway, while the activation of beta-Catenin could reduce the
   inflammatory response by inhibiting NF-kappa B-mediated inflammatory
   factors. The findings will contribute to the application of squalene as
   an immune enhancer for aquaculture and medical industry.

AB Heart disease presents significant challenges to healthcare systems
   globally, being the primary cause of death and disability. Timely and
   accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective disease management and
   prevention. However, traditional medical approaches often face issues
   like misdiagnoses and treatment delays, leading to higher costs and
   health complications for patients. Machine learning (ML) algorithms
   offer promising solutions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing
   errors. There is a growing interest in utilizing ML in healthcare, with
   ML methods playing a crucial role in analyzing medical data and
   assisting healthcare decisions despite facing challenges inaccurate
   identification. In this study, we propose a novel approach to enhance
   heart disease detection using a stacked ensemble model integrating
   various ML techniques. Initially, we address data quality by identifying
   and removing outliers. Then, three feature selection methods (Pearson,
   Chi-Square Test, and Recursive Feature Elimination) are applied to
   improve model performance. The resulting stacked classifier model
   exhibits superior accuracy (93.3%), precision (91.9%), and F1 score
   (93.9%), demonstrating significant improvements over raw data.
   Additionally, we employ Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values for
   interpretability, providing insights into feature importance. This study
   aims to advance heart disease diagnosis and contribute to better patient
   outcomes by integrating quantitative metrics and concise descriptions of
   the proposed solution.

AB Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) - a 2D carbonaceous material - is
   coupled as the composite partner with green synthesized cerium doped
   zinc oxide to form (ZnO:Ce) green /g-C3N4 nanocomposite. The (ZnO)green
   and (ZnO:Ce) green nanomaterials were synthesized via a green route
   using the extract of Morinda citrifolia plant leaves. The photocatalytic
   dye detoxification test conducted on organic dyes showed that the
   (ZnO)greenand (ZnO:Ce)green exhibited an efficiency of only 90 and 93 %,
   respectively against the dye malachite green (MG) for irradiation time
   of 30 min. However, the coupling of g-C3N4 as composite partner with
   (ZnO:Ce) green remarkably improved the detoxification efficiency to 99 %
   for MG. A similar trend was observed for another test dye rose bengal
   (RB) too. The heterojunction Z-scheme mechanism that governs the
   photocatalytic activity of the partners (ZnO: Ce)greenand -g-C3N4 of the
   nanocomposite is demonstrated with the support of other analytical
   studies such as XRD, SEM, TEM, FTIR and UV is absorption. The
   (ZnO:Ce)green/g-C3N4 nanocomposite exhibited significant antioxidant
   (DPPH radical scavenging assay), antidiabetic (alpha-glucosidase enzyme
   inhibitory assay), and antiinflammatory (protein denaturation assay)
   activities with the inhibition percentage of 87, 92 and 90 %,
   respectively. Thus, this green routed nanocomposite (ZnO:Ce)green/g-C3N4
   can be used as an eco-friendly heterojunction photocatalyst for
   cost-effective dye waste removal and a potential bio-medical agent.

AB Clinical Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is challenging due to the
   need for medical expertise and comprehensive reasoning chains for
   diagnosis. This paper introduces a novel cascade
   retrieval-while-reasoning framework for clinical MRC that incrementally
   retrieves and processes multiple supporting documents to effectively
   address the complexities of answering medical questions. The proposed
   cascade system is designed in such away that easier questions are
   processed by shallower network layers with fewer documents, while more
   difficult ones are handled by deeper layers with more documents. In the
   proposed system, a retriever is designed to provide knowledge documents
   incrementally according to the comprehended difficulty level of each
   question, which interacts with the reader via query updating for each
   retrieval and modifies its search direction to better exploit the
   knowledge bank. To handle the supporting information from incrementally
   retrieved documents, a progressive attention mechanism is designed to
   extract cross-document features for better reasoning. The attentional
   information from multiple supporting documents is then aggregated for
   the final decision. The proposed method is compared with
   state-of-the-art models for medical MRC tasks on a large medical QA
   dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed model effectively
   combines multiple knowledge documents to solve challenging real-world
   clinical diagnosis problems. It significantly outperforms the previously
   best-performing model by 1.84%, reaching an accuracy of 63.00%.

AB Heart diseases are the main international cause of human defunction.
   According to the WHO, nearly 18 million people decease each year because
   of heart diseases. Also considering the increase of medical data, much
   pressure is put on the health industry to develop systems for early and
   accurate heart disease recognition. In this work, an automatic cardiac
   pathology recognition system based on a novel deep learning framework is
   proposed, which analyses in real-time echocardiography video sequences.
   The system works in two stages. The first one transforms the data
   included in a database of echocardiography sequences into a machine
   learning- compatible collection of annotated images which can be used in
   the training phase of any kind of machine learning-based framework,
   including deep learning. This includes the use of the Higher Order
   Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) algorithm, for the first time to the
   authors' knowledge, for both data augmentation and feature extraction in
   the medical field. The second stage is focused on building and training
   a Vision Transformer (ViT), barely explored in the related literature.
   The ViT is adapted for an effective training from scratch, even with
   small datasets. The designed neural network analyses images from an
   echocardiography sequence to predict the heart state. The results
   obtained show the efficacy of the HODMD algorithm and the superiority of
   the proposed system, even outperforming pretrained Convolutional Neural
   Networks (CNNs), which are so far the method of choice in the
   literature.

AB Medical image segmentation serves as an important tool in the treatment
   of various medical diseases. However, achieving precise and efficient
   segmentation remains challenging due to the intricate structures and
   variations. Although neural network methods based on U-shaped structures
   have shown impressive results, they often lack effective representation
   of global-local features, leading to insufficient extraction of
   multi-scale and contextual information in medical image segmentation
   tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel approach: a
   dilated dendritic module with deep supervision, namely 3DL-Net. It
   integrates the flexible dilated convolution mechanism into the
   segmentation architecture, aiming to expand the model's receptive field
   and capture richer global features. Additionally, in contrast to other
   segmentation architectures, we innovatively introduce the processing of
   local feature of shallow structures through the dendritic neuron module
   in medical images into 3DL-Net. This is the first time dendritic
   learning has been employed at the channel level and represents a
   pioneering approach to the local feature process. During the training
   process, 3DL-Net incorporates a deep supervision mechanism that utilizes
   our designed loss function. Due to the intermediate supervision signals
   at various network stages, providing feedback at multiple levels, the
   model refines its predictions across various scales, contributing to
   further enhanced segmentation outcomes. To evaluate the effectiveness of
   our proposed method, we conducted extensive experiments on three medical
   image datasets to demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation
   accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models. Our mDice metrics on three
   datasets achieved 86.61%, 87.87%, and 85.06%, surpassing the second-best
   models by 3.85%, 1.54%, and 0.95%.

AB Background: The NHS spends 4.3 pound billion annually to address
   musculoskeletal conditions, encompassing age- related bone disorders
   like osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. Traditional X-ray diagnostic
   methods are commonly employed for bone disorder diagnosis, primarily
   assessing gross anatomical bone structure changes. However, these
   methods are unable to identify subtle biochemical alterations within the
   bone. More detailed information, particularly about protein changes, may
   lead to enhanced diagnostics and treatment. Raman spectroscopy is a
   non-invasive, laser-based technique capable of detecting changes in the
   collagen component of bone. Despite its long-standing application in
   discerning mineral and protein changes within bone, there is limited
   evidence on Raman spectral signatures of purified human collagens and
   their differentiation. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that
   Raman spectroscopy could detect different types of collagen in the human
   body. Results: A Raman microspectrometer with a 785 nm laser was used to
   measure unmineralized human collagens types I - VI and collagenous
   extracellular matrix (ECM) secreted by MG63 osteoblast-like cells. The
   results demonstrated the efficacy of Raman spectroscopy and subsequent
   multivariate analysis in distinguishing human collagen types I - VI.
   This implies that Raman spectroscopy, coupled with multivariate
   analysis, can identify pure human collagens and offers reference spectra
   similar to natural human collagen in the bone extracellular matrix.
   Significance: This study establishes Raman spectroscopy as a tool for
   identifying and characterizing human collagens, aiding in the diagnosis
   of connective tissue disorders. The creation of a spectral reference
   library for pure human collagen types I - VI holds potential for medical
   diagnostics, analytical chemistry, and materials science applications.

AB Ultrasound is one of the most commonly used imaging tools in prostate
   biopsy and brachytherapy. However, due to issues such as blurred image
   boundaries, similar intensity distributions, and noise, accurate
   segmentation of the prostate gland has been challenged. We propose a
   multi-scale dense connectivity hybrid dilated convolutional U-Net
   (MDDU-Net) network model segmentation of 2D prostate ultrasound images
   to improve the segmentation accuracy. Our proposed hybrid dilated
   convolution (HDC) module consists of standard and dilated convolution,
   which can expand the receptive field of the network, focus on global
   information, capture more features, and improve the learning ability of
   the model. Introducing dense connectivity (Dense) maximizes the flow of
   information between layers, retains more details, and helps mitigate
   gradient vanishing. The output features of each convolution layer in the
   bottleneck and decoder are fused using a multi-scale fusion block (MSFB)
   to obtain a feature map with richer semantic and detailed information. A
   dense skip connection provides more raw information to the decoder. To
   verify the superiority of our proposed method, we performed a 5-fold
   cross-validation, quantitatively analyzed it using five commonly used
   medical image evaluation metrics, and compared it with several
   state-of-the-art segmentation methods. The results show that our method
   performs better in prostate ultrasound image segmentation and can
   achieve more accurate prostate segmentation.

AB Thrombosis, when occurring undesirably, disrupts normal blood flow and
   poses significant medical challenges. As the skeleton of blood clots,
   fibrin fibers play a vital role in the formation and fragmentation of
   blood clots. Thus, studying the deformation and fracture characteristics
   of fibrin fiber networks is the key factor to solve a series of health
   problems caused by thrombosis. This study employs a coarse-grained model
   of fibrin fibers to investigate the rupture dynamics of fibrin fiber
   networks. We propose a new method for generating biomimetic fibrin fiber
   networks to simulate their spatial geometry in blood clots. We examine
   the mechanical characteristics and rupture behaviors of fibrin fiber
   networks under various conditions, including fiber junction density,
   fiber tortuosity, fiber strength, and the strain limit of single fiber
   rupture in both tension and simple shear cases. Our findings indicate
   that the stress-strain relationship of the fibrin fiber network follows
   a similar pattern to that of individual fibers, characterized by a
   shortened entropy stretching phase and an extended transition phase.
   Fiber junction density, fiber strength, and single fiber rupture limit
   predominantly influence the stress of the network, while fiber
   tortuosity governs the strain behavior. The availability of more fibers
   in shear cases to bear the load results in delayed rupture compared to
   tension cases. With consideration of different factors of fibrin fibers
   in networks, this work provides a more realistic description of the
   mechanical deformation process in fibrin fiber networks, offering new
   insights into their rupture and failure mechanisms. These findings could
   inspire novel approaches and methodologies for understanding the
   fracture of fibrin networks during a surgical thrombectomy.

AB Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common malignancy that
   metastasizes to the thyroid; however, metastasis of RCC to a primary
   tumor of the thyroid is rare. The present study reports the case of RCC
   that had metastasized to the primary thyroid tumor; namely, a
   hyalinizing trabecular tumor (HTT). Notably, the RCC was resected 2
   years prior. A 60-year-old female patient was referred to Ningbo Beilun
   District People's Hospital with radiographic findings indicating thyroid
   nodules. The patient's previous medical history included a left
   nephrectomy for the treatment of clear cell (cc)RCC in February 2021. No
   other distant metastases were identified as of the latest follow-up in
   April 2023. No abnormalities were observed during thyroid function tests
   prior to thyroid surgery. The surgical specimen appeared as a
   multinodular goiter with a solid nodule measuring 55x41x33 mm on the
   left lobe of the thyroid. Microscopic examination revealed a gray-yellow
   area inside the capsule of the largest nodule of the left lobe, which
   was composed of clear cells arranged in a solid pattern. Notably, tumor
   cells in other areas exhibited trabecular, nested and island patterns.
   Results of an immunohistochemical examination revealed that the clear
   cell lesion was negative for thyroid transcription factor-1 and
   calcitonin, and strongly positive for carbonic anhydrase IX, common
   acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen and vimentin. To the best of our
   knowledge, the present study is the first to report a case of ccRCC that
   had metastasized to a HTT. A preliminary analysis of the potential
   mechanisms underlying ccRCC metastasis was performed. Following total
   thyroidectomy, the patient was treated with levothyroxine, underwent
   anti-programmed death-1 monoclonal antibody immunotherapy and small
   molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeted therapy. An enhanced
   computed tomography scan revealed no evidence of metastatic disease to
   other organs. As of the latest follow-up, the patient was in a good
   condition with no sign of metastasis or recurrence.

AB Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a spectroscopy technique widely used
   by chemists and physicists to determine the chemical structure of
   molecules that was adapted to generate imaging, known as nuclear
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is widely used in medical
   diagnosis. The importance of NMR in chemistry, physics, medicine,
   materials, and agriculture has been recognized with several Nobel Prizes
   in Physics, 1952, Chemistry, 1991 and 2002, and Medicine in 2003.
   Therefore, NMR can be applied to obtain: i) imaging of the human body,
   animal and materials; ii) highresolution spectra to obtain structural
   and dynamical information of chemicals, materials etc.; and iii)
   quantitative and qualitative information of chemical composition of
   products such as food and agricultural products, using low-resolution
   relaxometry. High-resolution NMR and MRI have been applied in agri-food
   products, mostly as a research tool as they typically rely on expensive
   and bulk instruments, which restrict their uses in routine applications.
   The NMR sensors that have been more frequently used in agri-food
   products are based on low-resolution or low-field or time-domain NMR
   (TD-NMR) instruments. These low-cost instruments have been used for
   qualitative and quantitative analysis of agri-food products such as
   intact seeds and grains, intact fruits, meat, oils, and processed foods.
   In this paper, an overview of the NMR techniques and its main
   instrumentation aspects are presented, and some applications of TD-NMR
   and MRI in the non-invasive analysis of food, seeds, and others
   agricultural products are discussed.

AB PurposeTo evaluate the effect of CPAP and surgical alternatives for OSA
   on depression and compare the results of surgery to CPAP.MethodsCOCHRANE
   Library, CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus databases were searched for
   English-language articles. Meta-analysis of continuous measures (mean),
   proportions (%), and mean difference (Delta) with 95% confidence
   interval was conducted for objective and subjective outcomes before and
   after treatment with CPAP or surgical interventions.ResultsWe identified
   2018 abstracts, 14 studies (N = 3,488) were included in the
   meta-analysis. Both treatments witnessed significant improvement in
   Apnea-hypopnea Index (AHI), with similar improvement with CPAP
   (Delta-48.8 [-51.2, -46.4]) and surgical interventions (Delta -20.22
   [-31.3, -9.17]). An improvement in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) was
   noted between groups with (Delta -3.9 [-6.2, -1.6]) for the CPAP group
   and (Delta -4.3 [-6.0, -2.5]) for surgical interventions. The
   improvement of BDI II depression scores pre- and post-treatment was
   comparable between treatments with (Delta -4.1 [-5.8, -2.4]) for the
   CPAP group and (Delta- 5.6 [-9.2, -2.0]) for surgical
   interventions.ConclusionOur findings suggest a reduction in AHI is seen
   in both CPAP and surgical interventions for OSA, with no difference in
   AHI reduction between groups. Both treatments also lead to a similar
   improvement in depression scores providing strong evidence regards
   impact of surgery on OSA-associated mood disorders. While percent
   reduction in depression is higher in the surgical group, the difference
   did not reach statistical significance when compared to CPAP. When
   stratified by surgical intervention, most interventions suggest an
   improvement in depression scores.

AB Purpose: To describe patterns of 6-month total cost of care and acute
   care utilization among cancer survivors who received ostomy surgeries in
   3 large hospital systems in the United States between 2018 and 2022 and
   to identify reasons for acute care utilization. Methods: A retrospective
   cohort study using electronic medical records and the corresponding
   hospital revenue data obtained from 3 geographically diverse hospital
   systems in the United States was performed. 6-month all- cause
   post-surgical encounters subsequent to respective ostomy surgery dates
   were included. Clinical reasons for acute care utilization were captured
   and examined via available diagnosis codes. Results: Mean six-month
   total cost of care per patient varied greatly by hospital and by payer
   type, ranging between $18,000 and $80,000. Inpatient care was the
   largest driver of these cost, accounting for 70 % of the total cost of
   care. In the sample, 56 % of the patients experienced one or more
   post-surgical inpatient admissions over a six-month period. Moreover, 26
   % of the acute care events were associated with primary or secondary
   diagnosis codes potentially attributable to post-surgical ostomy-related
   complications, accounting for approximately 18 % of the total cost.
   Patients who received urostomy and/or had metastatic cancer had higher
   rates of acute care utilization, although statistical significances were
   not achieved. Conclusion: The results are indicative of significant
   financial burdens as well as morbidities associated with postsurgical
   ostomy care that are common across hospital systems. Some of these cost
   burdens are potentially avoidable with improved ostomy follow-up care.

AB Purpose: We aimed to assess the changes in body fat distribution,
   intraorgan lipid accumulation, and cardiometabolic risk factors after 6
   months of gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) in transgender men
   (TM) and transgender women (TW). Methods: Conducted at the Medical
   University of Vienna between 2019 and 2022, the study included 15 TW and
   20 TM. We conducted magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy to
   determine the visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)
   amounts, the VAT/SAT ratio, and the intraorgan lipid content (liver,
   pancreas, myocardium), bloodwork, and an oral glucose tolerance test at
   baseline and after 6 months of GAHT. Results: Pancreatic, hepatic, and
   intramyocardial lipid contents did not significantly change in either
   group after 6 months of GAHT. In TW, VAT/SAT ratio decreased
   significantly from baseline 0,930 (IQR 0,649-1,287) to 0,758 (IQR
   0,424-0,900; p = 0,011) after 6 months of GAHT. The updated homeostatic
   model assessment for insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-%S) significantly
   decreased from 83,03 % (+31,11) to 64,27 % (+18,01; p = 0,047),
   indicating decreased insulin sensitivity, while the updated homeostatic
   model assessment for beta-cell function (HOMA2-%beta) increased (from
   128,11 % (+35,80) to 156,80 % (+39,49); p = 0,020) in TW after 6 months
   of GAHT. In TM, there were no changes in glucose metabolism parameters
   except for an increase in HbA1c (5,1% (+0,3) vs 5,3% (+0,4), p = 0,001).
   Conclusions: 6 months of GAHT were not associated with statistically
   significant changes in myocardial, hepatic, or pancreatic lipid content.
   Short-term GAHT led to a marked body fat redistribution with a
   significant decrease in the VAT/SAT ratio in TW.

AB Today, Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) based on Pixel Value Ordering (PVO)
   approaches have gained significant attention from scientists. The number
   of PVO-based RDH schemes developed to protect valuable data in the
   military and medical sectors has constantly increased. In this paper, we
   propose a dual-pixels (where two consecutive pixels have a mutually
   influential relationship) reversible data hiding method and utilize it
   to develop anew PVO-based RDH scheme. In this proposed approach, the
   dual-pixels unit is employed as an embedding unit, and a maximum of two
   message bits are hidden into a dual-pixels pair. Additionally, the
   embedding capacity is enhanced by utilizing an interleaved data hiding
   technique. Experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme is
   superior to related state-of-the-art approaches in terms of embedding
   capacity and visual quality.

AB Ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) has emerged as a promising
   non-invasive method for muscle evaluation by assessing the propagation
   velocity of an induced shear wavefront. In skeletal muscles, the
   propagation of shear waves is complex, depending not only on the
   mechanical and acoustic properties of the tissue but also upon its
   geometry. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the influence
   of muscle pennation angle on the shear wave propagation, which is
   directly related to the shear modulus. A novel elastography method based
   on steered pushing beams (SPB) was used to assess the shear modulus
   along the fibers of the gastrocnemius medialis (pennate) muscle in
   twenty healthy volunteers. Ultrasound scans were performed during
   passive muscle lengthening (n = 10) and submaximal isometric
   contractions (n = 10). The shear modulus along the fibers was compared
   to the apparent shear modulus, as commonly assessed along the muscle
   shortening direction using conventional SWE sequences. The shear modulus
   along the muscle fibers was significantly greater than the apparent
   shear modulus for passive dorsiflexion angles, while not significantly
   different throughout the range of plantar flexion angles (i.e., under
   any or very low tensile loads). The concomitant decrease in pennation
   angle along with the gradual increase in the shear modulus difference
   between the two methods as the muscle lengthens, strongly indicates that
   non-linear elasticity exerts a greater influence on wave propagation
   than muscle geometry. In addition, significant differences between
   methods were found across all submaximal contractions, with both shear
   modulus along the fibers and the pennation angle increasing with the
   contraction intensity. Specifically, incremental contraction intensity
   led to a greater bias than passive lengthening, which could be partly
   explained by distinct changes in pennation angle. Overall, the new SPB
   sequence provides a rapid and integrated geometrical correction of shear
   modulus quantification in pennate muscles, thereby eliminating the
   necessity for specialized systems to align the ultrasound transducer
   array with the fiber's orientation. We believe that this will contribute
   for improving the accuracy of SWE in biomechanical and clinical
   settings.

AB Background: Timely vascular access forms a necessary part of patient
   management in the Emergency Department (ED). Factors such as
   hypotension, intravenous drug use, obesity, dark skin, patients at
   extremes of age, and patients with multiple injuries may make peripheral
   intravenous cannulation difficult. The intraosseous route remains a
   suitable alternative for emergency circulatory access. The objectives of
   this study were to describe the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of
   doctors in the ED about the use of intraosseous access in critically ill
   adult patients. Methods: A descriptive study was performed in the EDs of
   four hospitals in Gauteng, South Africa. Questionnaires were distributed
   to doctors working in the ED, including intern medical doctors,
   community service medical doctors, emergency medicine medical officers,
   emergency medicine registrars, as well as emergency medicine
   consultants. Results: Of 88 participants 64.8 % of participants had
   never used intraosseous access on adult patients in a resuscitation in
   the ED. Those who do use intraosseous access, use it 1.5 times a month,
   per clinician. Reasons for not using intraosseous access included: lack
   of equipment availability, lack of experience, and other preferable
   methods. Conclusion: The advantages of using the intraosseous route for
   circulatory access include its reliability, ease of teaching, rapid use,
   and low complication rates. Despite sufficient knowledge of intraosseous
   access and training received at various courses; provider preference and
   other systemic barriers, lead to an overall reduction in intraosseous
   access being used in the clinical setting. Intraosseous access remains a
   cost-effective, life-saving technique for gaining circulatory access.
   These results can be used to create awareness regarding the availability
   of other alternatives for gaining circulatory access, enhancing
   education and training, and improve the standard of health care,
   particularly in resource-limited settings.

AB A rapid, low-cost and reliable interfacial plasmonic nanoarray is
   presented as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensing platform
   for preliminary quantification and identification of flavonoids. Here,
   CTAB-modified Au colloidal nanoparticles self-assemble at the
   cyclohexane/acetone-water interface to form a uniform interfacial
   plasmonic nanoarray. The target hydrophobic analytes including organic
   dye methyl red and water-insoluble flavonoids, are effectively captured
   at the air-water interface and enter the "hot spots" between
   nanoparticles during the evaporation of the oil phase, which contributes
   to sensitive and reproducible SERS signals. Furthermore, this remarkable
   SERS performance enables the quantitative determination of
   water-insoluble flavonoids such as kaempferol, luteolin and naringenin
   with low detection limits of 10-10 M, and an approximately linear
   correlation between SERS signals and analytical concentrations, as well
   as rapid multiplex analysis of flavonoids with similar structural
   characteristics. Additionally, directly relative content detection of
   crude extracts from lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea L.) is achieved
   on the plasmonic nanoarray, serving as a proof-ofconcept demonstration
   for practical applications. Compared to conventional analyses of
   flavonoids, the proposed SERS platform circumvents complex and
   time-consuming pretreatments, thereby opening avenues for the analysis
   of oil-soluble samples and other secondary metabolites, which will
   facilitate widespread evaluation of quality and medical value.

AB The intersection of HIV and melanoma presents a complex and unique
   challenge, marked by distinct patterns in incidence, mortality, and
   treatment response. Higher mortality rates among people with HIV who
   develop melanoma underscore an urgent need to identify the factors
   influencing these outcomes. Investigating immune system dynamics, the
   effects of anti-retroviral drugs, and the evolving landscape of cancer
   immunotherapy in this population holds promise for new insights, though
   significant uncertainties remain. Over the past 25 years, melanoma
   research has demonstrated that a robust immune response is critical for
   effective treatment. In the context of chronic HIV infection, viral
   reservoirs enable the virus to persist despite anti-retroviral therapy
   and foster dysregulated myeloid and T cell compartments. The resulting
   chronic inflammation weakens the immune system and damages tissues,
   potentially creating "cold" tumor microenvironments that are less
   responsive to therapy. In this challenging context, animal models become
   invaluable for uncovering underlying biological mechanisms. While these
   models do not fully replicate human HIV infection, they provide
   essential insights into critical questions and inform the development of
   tailored treatments for this patient population. Clinically, increasing
   trial participation and creating a centralized, accessible repository
   for HIV and cancer samples and data are vital. Achieving these goals
   requires institutions to address barriers to research participation
   among people with HIV, focusing on patient-centered initiatives that
   leverage biomedical research to improve their outcomes and extend their
   lives.

AB Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents an aggressive neuroendocrine
   (NE) tumor within the pulmonary region, characterized by very poor
   prognoses. Druggable targets for SCLC remain limited, thereby
   constraining treatment options available to patients.
   Immuno-chemotherapy has emerged as a pivotal therapeutic strategy for
   extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC), yet it fails to confer significant
   efficacy in cases involving liver metastases (LMs) originating from
   SCLC. Therefore, our attention is directed towards the challenging
   subset of SCLC patients with LMs. Disease progression of LM-SCLC
   patients is affected by various factors in the tumor microenvironment
   (TME), including immune cells, blood vessels, inflammatory mediators,
   metabolites, and NE substances. Beyond standard immuno-chemotherapy,
   ongoing efforts to manage LMs in SCLC encompass anti-angiogenic therapy,
   radiotherapy, microwave ablation (MWA) / radiofrequency ablation (RFA),
   trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE), and systemic therapies in
   conjunction with local interventions. Prospective experimental and
   clinical investigations into SCLC should prioritize precise and
   individualized approaches to enhance the prognosis across distinct
   patient cohorts.

AB Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of death in women around
   the world. A majority of deaths from breast cancer occur due to cancer
   cells colonizing distant organ sites. When colonizing these distant
   organ sites, breast cancer cells have been known to enter into a state
   of dormancy for extended periods of time. However, the mechanisms that
   promote dormancy as well as dormant-to-proliferative switch are not
   fully understood. The tumor microenvironment plays a key role in
   mediating cancer cell phenotype including regulation of the dormant
   state. In this review, we highlight cell-cell interactions in the tumor
   microenvironment mediating breast cancer dormancy at the primary and
   metastatic sites. Specifically, we describe how immune cells from the
   lymphoid lineage, tumor-associated myeloid lineage cells, and stromal
   cells of non-hematopoietic origin as well as tissue resident stromal
   cells impact dormancy vs. proliferation in breast cancer cells as well
   as the associated mechanisms. In addition, we highlight the importance
   of developing model systems and the associated considerations that will
   be critical in unraveling the mechanisms that promote primary and
   metastatic breast cancer dormancy mediated via cell-cell interactions.

AB While the prevalence of cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) is high in
   cancer patients, its molecular mechanisms have not been fully
   elucidated. Moreover, the risks of recurrent CAT events and mortality
   remain high in cancer patients despite the introduction of
   anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy. Here, we discuss the possibility
   that increased plasmin activity driven by anticoagulant/antiplatelet
   treatment might be the major mechanism responsible for the activation of
   an excess of cancer-derived transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)
   originating from cancer cells and the tumour microenvironment. Hence,
   high coagulation and fibrinolysis rates in cancer patients may be linked
   to high rates of TGF-beta activation, especially the excess of TGF-beta
   derived from cancer cells. In turn, high TGF-beta activation could
   contribute directly to maintaining high thrombotic risk and CAT
   recurrence in cancer patients since TGF-beta signalling increases gene
   expression and secretion of the fibrinolysis inhibitor plasminogen
   activator inhibitor 1 (PAI1). Thus, TGF-beta could directly contribute
   to the high number of deaths among patients with cancer experiencing
   CAT, despite anticoagulant/antiplatelet treatment. In a longer-term
   perspective, increased TGF-beta activation, by supporting a
   pro-coagulant cancer microenvironment, might also accelerate cancer
   progression. This review aims to discuss the published evidence that
   might support the scenario described above, and to put forward the
   hypothesis that cancer patients experiencing CAT events would largely
   benefit from anti-TGF-beta therapy.

AB Tumor metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality and
   remains a major hurdle in cancer treatment. Traditional cigarette
   smoking has been extensively studied for its role in promoting
   metastasis. However, the impact of e-cigarette (e-cig) on cancer
   metastasis is not well understood despite their increasing popularity as
   a supposedly safer alternative. This mini review synthesizes current
   literature on the effects of e-cig on cancer metastasis, focusing on the
   processes of dissemination, dormancy, and colonization. It also
   incorporates recent findings from our laboratory regarding the role of
   e-cig in tumor progression. E-cig exposure enhances metastatic potential
   through various mechanisms: it induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition
   (EMT), increasing cell migratory and invasive capabilities; promotes
   lymphangiogenesis, aiding tumor cell spread; and alters the
   pre-metastatic niche to support dormant tumor cells, enhancing their
   reactivation and colonization. Furthermore, e-cig induce significant
   epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications,
   which regulate genes involved in metastasis. Our data suggest that e-cig
   upregulate histone demethylases like KDM6B in macrophages, impacting the
   TME and promoting metastasis. These findings underscore the need for
   further research to understand the long-term health implications of
   e-cig use and inform public health policies to reduce e-cig use.

AB Background: Ensuring patient safety is of paramount importance in
   healthcare systems. Rising concerns about medical errors in the UK have
   necessitated a greater focus on studying the nature of such errors,
   particularly those involving high-risk medications. Objectives: To
   conduct a retrospective analysis of incidents related to patient safety
   in the UK based on data from the National Rporting and Learning System
   (NRLS). Methods: This study was conducted based on a review of the
   National Reporting and Learning System ( NRLS) patient safety reports
   published between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015. NHS
   Improvement provides details regarding incidents following approval
   using a data-sharing agreement. In total, 1500 incidents were analszed
   and equally divided among the three categories of high-risk drugs:
   opioids, insulin, and anticoagulants. Excel (R) features and deductive
   reasoning (thematic analysis) were used for data analysis. Results: The
   results showed that the insulin category had both the highest risk and
   most errors compared with anticoagulants and opioids. These errors
   primarily result from issues related to administering, prescribing, and
   dispensing the drugs. Inadequate drug checks, communication difficulties
   among staff and patients, and high staff workloads are often linked to
   these errors. Conclusion: This study confirms that the NRLS database is
   a valuable source of data, and the suggestions put forth, based on these
   results, could contribute to the formulation of measures that diminish
   the occurrence of errors related to high-risk drugs in healthcare
   settings. Information technology should enhance medication safety by
   tracking the process of medication use.

AB Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is primarily transmitted via the fecal-oral
   route and is considered an anthropozoonosis. Genotypes with zoonotic
   potential (mainly HEV-3 and HEV-4) can be transmitted through the
   consumption of raw or undercooked pork, wild boar, deer meat, or
   processed products. This study aims to explore methodologies for
   processing meat samples to establish a protocol for HEV detection in
   meat. The analysis of pre-analytical conditions involved comparing
   homogenization with PBS versus TRIzol, comparing tissue disruption
   methods (ultra-turrax versus mortar and pestle), and assessing nucleic
   acid extraction techniques (spin columns and magnetic beads) across
   three types of artificially contaminated meat matrices: pork, salmon
   (fish-meat), and salami. Each test included a process control virus
   (PP7) and an HEV transcript. Molecular detection was performed via
   RT-qPCR. Results indicated that TRIzol provided better recovery rates
   for homogenization, while spin columns were the most effective option
   for RNA extraction. Both the ultra-turrax homogenizer and the
   mortar-pestle methods were effective for pork and fish-meat
   homogenization, while the use of the UT yielded superior results for
   salami. HEV recovery rates were 36.7%, 26.3%, and 34.1% for salami,
   salmon, and pork meat, respectively. In conclusion, we reached a simple
   and reliable protocol for the detection of RNA-HEV from three meat
   matrices. This method, which includes homogenization with TRIzol,
   mechanical tissue disruption, and RNA extraction using spin columns
   followed by real-time PCR, can be applied in future studies to evaluate
   HEV prevalence in food sources and contribute to the discussion about
   HEV detection methodologies.

AB Raw vegetables irrigated with polluted water that may contain enteric
   viruses can be associated with foodborne viral disease outbreaks. The
   objective of this study is to investigate the possible transmission of
   enteric viruses from irrigation water to lettuce. Therefore, we
   performed a commercial multiplex real-time PCR assay to monitor the
   occurrence of enteric viruses in irrigation water samples and in raw
   vegetables that were cultivated at market gardening sites in
   Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. Samples were collected from six market
   gardening sites located in Ouagadougou. RT-PCR was performed to detect
   norovirus GI, norovirus GII, rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses F (Serotype
   40/41), astrovirus and sapovirus (Genogroups G1, 2, 4, 5). From the 10
   irrigation water samples and the 80 lettuce samples, three (30%) and
   twenty-two (27.5%) were positive for enteric viruses, respectively.
   Norovirus GII, astrovirus and enteric adenoviruses F (Serotype 40/41)
   were the most frequently detected viruses in lettuce and irrigation
   water samples. Our results indicate that raw vegetables may be
   contaminated with a broad range of enteric viruses, which may originate
   from virus-contaminated irrigation water, and these vegetables may act
   as a potential vector of food-borne viral transmission.

   organisms of gastrointestinal illness among the attendees of the F &
   eacute;d & eacute;ration Internationale de Football Association Football
   World Cup 2022 (FIFA 2022). Methods: The study was conducted at Hamad
   Medical Corporation in Qatar, which served as the national reference
   laboratory for all microbiology testing. We retrieved all stool testing
   data from the attendees of FIFA 2022 from October 1 to December 31,
   2022. Stool microscopy for ova and parasite and cultures were performed
   on all samples. Polymerase chain reaction testing was performed for
   cases of suspected foodborne outbreaks or when a rapid result was
   required for public health response. Results: Among 2179 samples tested,
   one or more organisms were identified in 424 cases. The most common
   reasons for testing were acute diarrhea/gastroenteritis (51.4%),
   abdominal pain (11.5%), screening/surveillance of contacts (10.6%), and
   fever (7.6%). Bacteria were identified in 92.5% (Salmonella spp. 40%,
   Escherichia coli 25.7%, and Shigella spp. 8.8%), viruses in 7.8%, and
   parasites in 2.8% of the samples. Conclusions: The number of individuals
   who underwent stool testing during the FIFA 2022 was low. The yield of
   stool testing was higher for those with acute diarrhea/gastroenteritis
   and fever but not for those with abdominal pain or for
   surveillance/screening.

AB BackgroundOvarian cancer being the most lethal gynecological cancer
   still poses a diagnostic challenge due to non-specific findings on
   imaging modalities which may mimic benign pathology. The study aimed to
   compare the diagnostic performance of RMI3 (Risk of malignancy index)
   and IOTA (International ovarian tumor analysis) score in prediction of
   ovarian malignancy in both post- and premenopausal women.Materials and
   MethodsThis prospective comparative study (June 2022-June 2024) done in
   Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in collaboration with
   Department of Pathology and Radiodiagnosis, GSVM, Medical College,
   Kanpur. The study was carried out on 68 participants presenting with
   newly diagnosed cases of adnexal masses, and patients were divided into
   two groups based on their menopausal status. Each group underwent
   through USG color Doppler of whole abdomen and pelvis alone with serum
   CA125 levels. Risk assessment was done by IOTA and RMI3, and results
   were compared with histopathology report/or USG-guided fine needle
   aspiration cytology (gold standard).ResultsThe study found that
   malignant ovarian cancer was reported in 11.4% patients of premenopausal
   and 66.7% patients of postmenopausal age group. Also the IOTA Score had
   better performance in both pre- and postmenopausal age group with
   overall sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and
   negative predictive value (NPV) being 100%, 97.6%, 96.3% and 100%,
   respectively, as compared to RMI3 which had sensitivity, specificity,
   positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of
   92.3%, 95.2%, 92.3% and 95.2%, respectively.ConclusionBoth IOTA and RMI3
   demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy for preoperative workup of adnexal
   masses in prediction of ovarian malignancies, but IOTA stood out as a
   superior alternative due to its simplicity, ease of use, and cost
   effectiveness.

AB The world's leading infectious disease killer tuberculosis (TB) has >10
   million new cases and ~1.5 million mortalities yearly. Effective TB
   control and management depends on accurate and timely diagnosis to
   improve treatment, curb transmission and reduce the burden on the
   medical system. Current clinical diagnostic methods for tuberculosis
   face the shortcomings of limited accuracy and sensitivity, time
   consumption and high cost of equipment and reagents. Nanomaterials have
   markedly enhanced the sensitivity, specificity and speed of TB detection
   in recent years, owing to their distinctive physical and chemical
   features. They offer several biomolecular binding sites, enabling the
   simultaneous identification of multiple TB biomarkers. Biosensors
   utilizing nanomaterials are often compact, user‑friendly and well‑suited
   for detecting TB on location and in settings with limited resources. The
   present review aimed to review the advances that have occurred during
   the last five years in the application of nanomaterials for TB
   diagnostics, focusing on their detection capabilities, structures,
   working principles and the significance of key nanomaterials. The
   current review addressed the limitations and challenges of
   nanomaterials‑based TB diagnostics, along with potential solutions.

   dibenzylideneacetones that are similar to curcumin and to perform the in
   silico evaluations on Plasmodium falciparum enoyl acyl carrier protein
   reductase (PfENR) and through human dihydrofolate reductase (hDHFR) as
   targets for antimalarial agents. Methods: The functionalized
   dibenzylideneacetones were synthesized through a reaction of acetone
   with benzaldehydes in a base or acid catalyst. The resulting solids were
   purified by recrystallization to conduct UV/Vis, FTIR, and NMR tests.
   The confirmed products underwent an in silico molecular docking test on
   PfENR (PDB ID: 1NHG) and hDHFR (PDB ID: 1MVT). The products were
   obtained in good yields. Results: The confirmed products underwent in
   silico molecular docking test on PfENR (PDB ID: 1NHG) and hDHFR (PDB ID:
   1MVT). The products were obtained with good yields. Based on in silico
   results, the dibenzylideneacetone was predicted to have a strong
   potential to inhibit the growth of malaria parasites through inhibit
   malaria growth through the PfENR pathway more than through the hDHFR
   pathway because its moldock score was lower than its native ligand.
   Conclusions: This study showed a promising pathway to obtain
   antimalarial agents for further application in the medical and
   pharmaceutical industries.

AB Introduction. - This case presents a unique scenario of bilateral
   camptodactyly in a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus, shedding light
   on an uncommon musculoskeletal complication. It contributes to the
   scientific literature by exploring the intricate relationship between
   diabetes and musculoskeletal disorders, emphasizing the need for
   heightened awareness and comprehensive management strategies. Case
   presentation. - The patient, a 34-year-old with longstanding type 1
   diabetes, exhibits progressive bilateral camptodactyly, accompanied by
   peripheral neuropathy and bilateral cataracts. Key clinical findings
   include permanent flexion deformities of the proximal interphalangeal
   joints, positive Phalen's and Tinel's signs, and reduced grip strength,
   highlighting the complex nature of the musculoskeletal manifestations of
   diabetes. Clinical discussion. - The main diagnoses in this case involve
   type 1 diabetes mellitus, bilateral camptodactyly, peripheral
   neuropathy, and potential genetic predisposition to Fabry disease.
   Therapeutic interventions include insulin therapy for diabetes
   management, pharmacological interventions for dyslipidemia, surgical
   intervention for cataracts, and conservative measures such as splinting
   and occupational therapy for camptodactyly. Despite some stabilization
   in glycemic control, the patient's hand deformities show limited
   improvement, emphasizing the challenges in managing complex
   musculoskeletal complications of diabetes. Conclusions. - The main
   takeaway from this case is the importance of considering atypical
   complications in diabetes management and adopting a multidisciplinary
   approach to address complex clinical presentations. It underscores the
   need for ongoing research into the diverse effects of diabetes on the
   musculoskeletal system to enhance patient care and outcomes.

AB Boron neutron capture therapy for recurrent head and neck cancer has
   been approved as an insurance covered treatment in Japan since June
   2020. The Kansai BNCT Medical Center has installed the NeuCure (R) BNCT
   system developed by Sumitomo Heavy Industries. This system utilises a
   beryllium target with a 30 MeV proton beam to generate neutrons. To
   date, the center has treated over 300 patients and the system is also
   used for quality control and fundamental research experiments.
   Information on the stability and longevity of the system is important
   for facilities and hospitals considering installation of a BNCT system
   in the future, particularly after an exchange of a major component, such
   as the target. The beam output (neutron and gamma ray) was measured
   before and after the exchange of the target. The thermal neutron, fast
   neutron and gamma ray distribution inside a water phantom was evaluated
   and the results showed no significant change in the beam quality after
   the exchange of the target. Furthermore, no significant change in the
   neutron flux as a function of increasing number of accumulated protons
   on the target was observed up to a value of just under 400 mAh. The
   NeuCure (R) BNCT system has been shown to be highly stable and the
   frequency of target replacement was much less than lithium target-based
   accelerators.

AB ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study is to investigate the diagnostic
   accuracy of a new noninvasive imaging technique, ultrasound-guided
   attenuation parameter (UGAP), in diagnosing hepatic steatosis. This
   single-center retrospective study included 81 UGAP studies performed to
   guide therapy between July 2022 and June 2023 at a large academic
   medical center. Patients with either liver biopsy or Magnetic
   resonance-based proton-density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) within 12 months
   of US-UGAP imaging, irrespective of order, were included. Patient
   demographics, body mass index, liver function tests, UGAP values,
   MRI-PDFF values, and liver biopsy results were obtained from a review of
   the medical records. Presence of steatosis was defined as PDFF >5.2% or
   >5% of hepatocytes with steatosis at pathology. Area under the ROC curve
   (AUROC) was used to measure UGAP accuracy for the detection of hepatic
   steatosis with statistical significance P < 0.05. There was a
   significant positive correlation between UGAP and MRI-PDFF (r = 0.463; P
   < 0.001; confidence interval [CI]: 0.220;0.651). The AUROC to
   differentiate absence of steatosis (n = 21) from presence of steatosis
   (n = 32) for UGAP with MRI as the gold standard was 0.760 (P < 0.001;
   CI: 0.623;0.867). A UGAP value >0.66 had 78% sensitivity and 67%
   specificity to identify steatosis presence on MRI-PDFF. The AUROC to
   differentiate absence of steatosis (n = 11) from presence of steatosis
   (n = 21) for UGAP with pathology as the gold standard was 0.894 (P <
   0.001; CI: 0.734;0.974). A UGAP value >0.57 had 100% sensitivity and 64%
   specificity to identify steatosis presence at pathology. UGAP is an
   accurate measure for detecting the presence of hepatic steatosis and may
   be a noninvasive method for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic
   liver disease diagnosis and follow-up.

   cohort from the Primary Open-Angle African American Glaucoma Genetics
   (POAAGG) study. center dot DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional
   "case-control" comparison study. center dot METHODS: A total of 6,634
   POAAGG study subjects were eligible: 2,977 cases and 3,657 controls.
   Ocular and demographic data were collected from on-site exams,
   standardized interviews, and electronic medical records. BMI was
   calculated: weight(kg)/height(m)2, and categorized as low ( < 18.5),
   moderate (18.5-24.9), high (25.0-29.9), or very high ( >= 30).
   Structural and functional POAG progression were assessed by annual rate
   of change in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and visual field mean
   deviation, respectively, using a linear mixed- effects model. Regression
   analyses evaluated associations of BMI with POAG status, phenotype, and
   progression. center dot RESULTS: Lower BMI was associated with increased
   POAG risk (aOR[95% confidence interval], 1.02 [1.007,1.023] per kg/m(2)
   decrease in BMI, p = .0003). In cases, low BMI was associated with
   larger cup-to-disc ratio ( p = .007) and worse visual acuity ( p = .04).
   Fast functional POAG progressors had a significantly lower mean BMI than
   slow progressors (25.7 vs. 30.0 kg/m(2), p = .04). center dot
   CONCLUSIONS: In this African ancestry cohort, low BMI was associated

AB Recently, the development of biomedical-engineered materials has
   received potential attention from different research scholars and
   industrial experts worldwide. Nanomaterials-modified polymer
   bio-nanocomposites are considered one of the most attractive
   biomedical-engineered materials thanks to their remarkable features
   large surface area, sustainable drug release, easy processing,
   cost-effectiveness, and biocompatibility. Graphene stands out as a
   leading nanomaterial that enhances the efficiency of
   biomedical-engineered materials, due to its exceptional surface
   functionality, mechanical strength, and electrical conductivity.
   Innovative graphene-modified bio-nanocomposite materials approach has
   opened promising avenues for cancer treatment, drug delivery, and
   biosensing, revolutionizing the landscape of medical interventions. This
   review highlights the recent progress in the field of biomedical
   applications, such as drug/gene delivery, tissue engineering,
   biosensing, bioimaging, and wound healing using graphene
   bio-nanocomposite materials. Additionally, it provides overview insights
   on synthesis approaches for preparing graphene bio-nanocomposites based
   on natural polymers, including polysaccharides, and proteins compared
   with synthetic polymers. The reported data from preclinical studies of
   drug-delivery bio-nanocomposites have shown targeted and sustainable
   drug release to specific cells or tissues with minimum side effects and
   excellent drug permeability, efficiency, and biocompatibility. Moreover,
   incorporating graphene enables live monitoring of drug release,
   fostering personalized medicine approaches and enhancing regenerative
   medicine. This leads the way for rapid and accurate diagnostics,
   essential for early disease detection and monitoring. With sustained and
   intensive research efforts, these promising findings could potentially
   be translated from research laboratories to clinical applications.

AB Background: Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys are promising candidates for
   biodegradable materials in next- generation bone implants due to their
   favourable mechanical properties and biodegradability. However, their
   rapid degradation and corrosion, potentially leading to toxic
   byproducts, pose significant challenges for widespread use. Objectives:
   This study aimed to address the challenges associated with Mg-based
   materials by thoroughly evaluating the biocompatibility, genotoxicity,
   and mechanical properties of Mg-based devices manufactured via Single
   Point Incremental Forming (SPIF). Additionally, the study explored the
   efficacy of a bioactive coating in enhancing the biocompatibility of
   these devices. Methods: The biocompatibility of six different Mg-SPIF
   substrates was assessed using an indirect cytotoxicity assay while
   genotoxicity was evaluated using the Ames test. Mg-based implants were
   subjected to roughness and thickness tests, as well as metallographic
   observations. To enhance biocompatibility, a coating comprising sodium
   hydroxide (NaOH), ascorbic acid (AA), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) was
   applied to the most promising Mg-SPIF devices. Results: None of the
   Mg-SPIF devices demonstrated genotoxicity. Out of the six devices
   evaluated, only two, which had lower surface roughness, exhibited the
   most favourable biocompatibility responses. Additionally, the surface
   functionalization strategy significantly enhanced the biocompatibility
   of these Mg-SPIF devices, demonstrating up to 70% improvement in cell
   viability compared to unmodified substrates, indicating substantial
   enhancement in biological performance. Conclusions: These results
   underscore the potential of SPIF Mg-based materials, particularly when
   enhanced with a bioactive OH-AA-BSA coating, to revolutionize medical
   implant technology by providing a safer and more effective option for a
   wide range of biomedical applications. While these in vitro findings are
   very promising, translation to clinical applications requires
   comprehensive in vivo validation, focusing on degradation kinetics,
   local tissue response, and mechanical integrity under physiological
   conditions.

AB Interactive segmentation allows active user participation to enhance
   output quality and resolve ambiguities. This may be especially
   indispensable to medical image segmentation to address complex anatomy
   and customization to varying user requirements. Existing approaches
   often encounter issues such as information dilution, limited
   adaptability to diverse user interactions, and insufficient response. To
   address these challenges, we present a novel 3D interactive framework
   P2ED that divides the task into four quadrants. It is equipped with a
   multi-granular prompt encrypted to extract prompt features from various
   hierarchical levels, along with a progressive hierarchical prompt
   decrypter to adaptively heighten the attention to the scarce prompt
   features along three spatial axes. Finally, it is appended by a
   calibration module to further align the prediction with user intentions.
   Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed P2ED achieves
   accurate results with fewer user interactions compared to
   state-of-the-art methods and is effective in promoting the upper limit
   of segmentation performance. The code will be released in

AB Incidental findings in diagnostic imaging are common, but follow-up
   recommendations often lack consistency. The Society of Radiologists in
   Ultrasound (SRU) issued guidelines in 2021 for managing incidentally
   detected gallbladder polyps, aiming to balance follow-up with avoiding
   overtreatment. There is variable adherence to these guidelines in
   radiology reports, however, which makes it difficult for the clinician
   to pursue appropriate follow-up for the patient. The purpose of this
   project is to test the feasibility of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based
   tool to incorporate SRU guidelines into radiology reports. Additionally,
   we propose a framework for closely integrating societal follow-up
   recommendations into radiology reports, using this tool as an example.
   Following institutional review board approval, we retrospectively
   reviewed gallbladder ultrasound examinations performed on adult ED
   patients in 2022. Data on patient demographics and radiology report
   content were collected. Using the 2021 SRU guidelines, we developed an
   interactive tool employing a retriever-augmented generator (RAG) and
   prompt engineering. A board-certified radiologist tested the accuracy,
   whereas a board-certified emergency medicine physician assessed the
   clarity and consistency of the recommendations. The interactive tool,
   GB-PRL, outperformed leading closed-source and open-source LLMs,
   achieving 100% accuracy in risk categorization and follow-up
   recommendations on hypothetical user queries (P < 0.001). The tool also
   showed superior accuracy compared to radiology reports on retrospective
   data (P = 0.04). Although GB-PRL demonstrated greater clarity and
   consistency, the improvement from the radiology reports was not
   statistically significant (P = 0.22). Further work is needed for
   prospective testing of GB-PRL before integrating it into clinical
   practice.

AB Tumors, due to their diversity and heterogeneity, pose a significant
   threat to human health. Multidrug resistance is a prevalent and grave
   issue in clinical treatment, resulting in treatment failure and cancer
   recurrence. This resistance renders conventional drug therapies
   ineffective, presenting a substantial challenge to human health and
   medical care. Exploring natural products as potential sources for
   anti-cancer drugs could lead to the development of innovative and
   efficacious cancer treatments. This article aims to investigate the
   health implications of natural products (such as paclitaxel,
   podophyllotoxin, homoharringtonine, camptothecin, and vinblastine) in
   the discovery of anti-cancer drugs while discussing the methods and
   progress made in researching novel anti-cancer drugs derived from
   natural products. The paper discusses the diversity, intricate
   structures, and target affinity of natural products along with their
   structural modification techniques, combination therapies utilization
   possibilities with prodrugs or nanoparticles. Additionally, considering
   the escalating multidrug resistance observed in tumors nowadays; certain
   natural products offer new insights and approaches for discovering
   effective anti-tumor drugs that are crucial for addressing global public
   health challenges. The challenges faced by natural products during drug
   development including issues related to bioavailability toxicity
   concerns as well as limited resources are examined thoroughly. Potential
   opportunities current issues along with future challenges are
   highlighted aiming at facilitating the clinical translation of original
   anti-cancer drugs using natural products.

AB Skin infections caused by microbes such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses
   often lead to aberrant skin functions and appearance, eventually
   evolving into a significant risk to human health. Among different drug
   administration paradigms for skin infections, microneedles (MNs) have
   demonstrated superiority mainly because of their merits in enhancing
   drug delivery efficiency and reducing microbial resistance. Also,
   integrating biosensing functionality to MNs offers point-of-care
   wearable medical devices for analyzing specific pathogens, disease
   status, and drug pharmacokinetics, thus providing personalized therapy
   for skin infections. Herein, we do a timely update on the development of
   MN technology in skin infection management, with a special focus on how
   to devise MNs for personalized antimicrobial therapy. Notably, the
   advantages of state-of-the-art MNs for treating skin infections are
   pointed out, which include hijacking sequential drug transport barriers
   to enhance drug delivery efficiency and delivering various therapeutics
   ( e.g. , antibiotics, antimicrobial peptides, photosensitizers, metals,
   sonosensitizers, nanoenzyme, living bacteria, poly ionic liquid, and
   nanomoter). In addition, the nanoenzyme-based multimodal antimicrobial
   therapy is highlighted in addressing intractable infectious wounds.
   Furthermore, the MN-based biosensors used to identify pathogen types,
   track disease status, and quantify antibiotic concentrations are
   summarized. The limitations of antimicrobial MNs toward clinical
   translation are offered regarding largescale production, quality
   control, and policy guidance. Finally, the future development of
   biosensing MNs with easy-to-use and intelligent properties and MN-based
   wearable drug delivery for home-based therapy are prospected. We hope
   this review will provide valuable guidance for future development in
   MN-mediated topical treatment of skin infections.

AB Aging is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Cardiac
   diastolic dysfunction (CDD), ultimately leading to heart failure with
   preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), is prevalent among older
   individuals. Although therapeutics have made great progress, preventive
   strategies remain unmet medical needs. Green tea catechins have been
   shown to be effective in improving aging-related cardiovascular and
   cerebral disorders in animal models and patients. However, little
   attention has been paid to whether long-term administration of
   epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major bioactive ingredient of green
   tea catechins, could prevent the onset and progression of CDD. In this
   study, 12-month-old female mice were orally administered 50, 100 and 200
   mg EGCG mixed with drinking water for 6 months. Aged mice (18 months
   old) exhibited the major features of HFpEF, including CDD with pEF,
   cardiac fibrosis, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and mitochondrial
   damages, as well as elevated A/B-type natriuretic peptide. Cardiac
   troponin I (cTnI) expression was also reduced. Long-term administration
   of 100 or 200 mg EGCG prevented aging-related CDD and exercise capacity
   decline, along with alleviating myocardial apoptosis and mitochondria
   damage. The transcription and protein expression of cTnI were increased,
   which might be achieved by inhibiting the expression and activity of
   histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and reducing its binding level near
   cTnI's promoter, thereby elevating acetylated histone 3 (AcH3) and
   acetylated lysine 9 on his- tone H3 (AcH3K9) in the aged mice. We
   provide a novel insight that long-term administration of EGCG is a
   potentially effective strategy in preventing aging-related CDD and cTnI
   expression decline.

AB The efficiency of probability distributions, which are fundamental to
   statistical analysis in many domains, is directly related to how well
   they match particular data attributes. Nonetheless, several real-world
   facts cast doubt on the presumptions of conventional distributions,
   highlighting the need for continuous improvements in probabilistic
   modeling. Anew, adaptable two-parameter modification of the inverse unit
   Teissier distribution (IUTD) developed using the transmutation approach
   is presented in this paper and called the transmuted inverse unit
   Teissier distribution (TrIUTD). By adding a transmutation parameter, the
   TrIUTD is better able to represent intricate data patterns that
   conventional distributions might not be able to fully represent. Because
   the TrIUTD's probability density function is right-skewed and unimodal,
   it can be used in a variety of contexts, including economic modeling,
   survival analysis, and reliability engineering. A growing failure rate
   is revealed by its hazard function, which makes it suitable for lifetime
   data analysis. The TrIUTD's quantile function, moments, survival
   function, odds ratio, failure rate average, Mills ratio, and order
   statistics were among its important attributes that were carefully
   deduced. Maximum likelihood estimation was shown to be the most reliable
   method out of fifteen various approaches used to estimate parameters for
   this model. Applications to three real-world datasets from the medical
   and radiation sciences proved the model's performance, and simulation
   tests verified the estimators' dependability. According to
   goodness-of-fit criteria, the TrIUTD showed abetter fit than well-known
   distributions, indicating its potential as a useful supplement to
   practical statistical modeling and distributional theory.

AB Biofilm formation on biological and material surfaces represents a heavy
   health and economic burden for both patient and society. To contrast
   this phenomenon, medical devices combining antibacterial and pro-wound
   healing abilities are a promising strategy. In the present work, Xanthan
   gum/Guar gum (XG/GG)-based scaffolds were tuned with thymol and Zn2+ to
   obtain wound dressings that combine antibacterial and antibiofilm
   properties and favour the healing process. The tuning process preserved
   the 3D extrusion-based printability of the XG/GG ink. Scaffolds swelling
   profile was assessed in PBS pH 7.4, and the resistance to compressive
   forces was studied using a texturometer. The scaffolds
   microarchitectures were analyzed by SEM, while ATR-FTIR spotlighted the
   chemical modifications of the customized materials. Thymol and Zn2+
   release was analyzed in biologically relevant media, showing a burst
   release in the first hours. The antibacterial properties were confirmed
   against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and S. epidermidis by isothermal
   microcalorimetry and biofilm viable cell counting. Incorporation of
   hydroxypropyl-(3-cyclodextrin (HP(3CD) improved thymol loading (7- and
   14times higher thymol content) and enhanced the antimicrobial and
   antioxidant performances of the dressing, while the presence of Zn2+
   strongly potentiated the antimicrobial activity, showing a potent
   antibiofilm response in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains of
   clinical concern. The thymol and Zn2+ combination led to a reduction of
   99.95 %, 99.99 %, and 98.26 %, of biofilm formation against S. aureus,
   P. aeruginosa, and S. epidermidis, respectively. Furthermore, the
   scaffolds demonstrated good hemocompatibility, cytocompatibility, tissue
   integration and pro-angiogenic features in an in ovo CAM model.

   steroid injections, allopurinol, and colchicine. Initial cultures
   yielded no growth. However, faint transparent colonies grew after
   discharge, which were eventually identified as M. hominis. Initial
   antibacterial therapy targeting suspect Mycoplasma spp. was begun with
   doxycycline, and the patient ultimately completed 12 weeks of
   doxycycline and clindamycin with cure. This case underscores the
   importance of maintaining clinical suspicion for fastidious organisms

   the association of second-victim distress, organizational support, and
   interprofessional collaboration with posttraumatic
   growth.BackgroundMedical errors are unavoidable in healthcare; however,
   when acknowledged and shared, they offer healthcare professionals an
   opportunity to learn and grow. Second-victim distress arises from
   learning from mistakes but can be stressful for nurses, prompting some
   to leave the profession. Furthermore, poor management may foster a
   culture of reluctance to admit errors. Therefore, addressing nurses'
   distress is crucial for posttraumatic growth and, ultimately, patient
   safety.MethodsThe participants were 435 nurses working in general or
   tertiary hospitals who completed an online survey. This cross-sectional
   study followed the guidelines of the STROBE checklist. The collected
   data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis to determine
   significant factors influencing posttraumatic growth.ResultsPhysical
   distress, interprofessional collaboration, colleague support,
   institutional support, nonwork-related support, professional
   self-efficacy, and the position of charge nurse significantly influenced
   posttraumatic growth. The regression model explained 32.2% of
   posttraumatic growth with isolation emerging as the most influential
   factor.ConclusionEncouraging cooperation among healthcare professionals,
   mitigating physical distress, and providing organizational support are
   necessary to galvanize posttraumatic growth. Interprofessional medical
   collaboration and prevention of nurse isolation may be crucial for
   converting second-victim distress into posttraumatic growth.Implications
   for nursing and health policyCareful consideration of factors
   influencing posttraumatic growth is necessary to develop interventions
   that can enable nurses to overcome second-victim distress and achieve
   higher-level growth. If nurses can successfully transform second-victim
   distress into posttraumatic growth, it will ultimately have a positive
   impact on patient safety and the quality of nursing care.

AB Objective: Evaluate the effect of fathers' participation in the Preemie
   Prep for Parents (P3) program on maternal learning and fathers' preterm
   birth knowledge. Methods: Mothers with preterm birth predisposing
   medical condition(s) enrolled with or without the baby's father and were
   randomized to the P3 intervention (text-messages linking to animated
   videos) or control (patient education webpages). Parent Prematurity
   Knowledge Questionnaire assessed knowledge, including unmarried fathers'
   legal neonatal decision-making ability. Results: 104 mothers reported
   living with the baby's father; 50 participated with the father and 54
   participated alone. In the P3 group, mothers participating with the
   father (n = 33) had greater knowledge than mothers participating alone
   (n = 21), 85 % correct responses vs. 76 %, p = 0.033. However, there was
   no difference in knowledge among the control mothers, 67 % vs. 60 %, p =
   0.068. P3 fathers (n = 33) knowledge scores were not different than
   control fathers (n = 17), 77 % vs. 68 %, p = 0.054. Parents who viewed
   the video on fathers' rights (n = 58) were more likely than those who
   did not (n = 96) to know unmarried fathers' legal inability to decide
   neonatal treatments, 84 % vs. 41 %, p < 0.001. Conclusions: Among
   opposite-sex cohabitating couples, fathers' participation in the P3
   program enhanced maternal learning.

AB Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is secondary to drug-induced hepatitis,
   resulting in damage or necrosis of liver cells and even liver failure.
   Assessing whether chronic medications induce liver injury and which
   medications are most likely to be the culprits is challenging. However,
   current biochemical and imaging diagnostic methods fail to detect this
   subclinical manifestation. Recent studies proved that the development of
   DILI is associated with dysfunction of lipid droplets (LDs). This is why
   we designed, in this paper, a new LDs-specific fluorescent probe (CF-PN)
   to monitor this biological process and evaluate the effects of relevant
   drugs on DILI. Interestingly, we found that DILI induced a significant
   increase in viscosity not only at the cellular level, but also in vivo.
   Such increase of LDs viscosity was related to lipase activity. More
   importantly, drug reviews have shown that chronic medications used to
   treat psychosis (droperidol, decafenazine, amitriptyloine,
   chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, and chlorprothixene), heart disease
   (mexiletine), hyperlipidaemia (simvastatin, bezafibrate, niacin, and
   acipimox), and hypertension (aspirin, dexamethasone, losartan,
   olmesartan, and candesartan) can all exacerbate the DILI, while the
   haloperidol for psychosis and the resveratrol for hyperlipidaemia can
   alleviate DILI to a certain extent. In conclusion, our work provides an
   effective method for medical diagnosis and drug safety assessment of
   DILI.

AB Nanobiotechnology is a rapidly growing field with numerous applications
   in the medical field. The discipline combines biological research with
   various fields of nanotechnology. Nanodevices, nanoparticles, and
   nanoscale phenomena within nanotechnology are enhanced through
   nanobiology. Typically, nanoparticles are synthesized using either a
   top-down or bottom-up approach. However, these chemical methods can be
   dangerous as they involve handling toxic chemicals and producing toxic
   by-products. Therefore, researchers have conducted several studies to
   extract and synthesise nanoparticles from living sources, known as the
   "Green synthesis of Nanoparticles." Silver nanoparticles are
   particularly prioritised because they are harmless to the human body but
   detrimental to microbes even in minimal concentrations. Much effort has
   been devoted to extracting them from plant sources and microbes. Animal
   extracts are also potential reducing agents for extracting silver
   nanoparticles without the use of any toxic substances. It has been
   discovered that extracts from various animals used in nanoparticle
   manufacturing contain biomolecules that act as reducing and capping
   agents. In line with this perspective, the present study focuses on
   using the telescope snail, Telescopium telescopium (Linnaeus, 1758), as
   an animal source for producing silver nanoparticles. The extracted
   TtSN-particles (Telescopium telescopium Silver Nanoparticles) were
   subjected to various characterisation methods, including Ultra Violet-
   Visible Spectroscopy (UV Spectroscopy), Fourier Transform Infrared
   Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron
   Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) and Dynamic Light
   Scattering Technique (DLS) analyses. The absorption of TtSN-particles
   was found at 360 nm. The sizes of the TtSN particles visualised in SEM
   were 98.44 nm, 81.88 nm, and 88.65 nm. The EDX pattern showed a
   predominance of silver in the colloidal solution of the synthesized
   TtSN-particles. In DLS, the intensity distribution was observed in
   diameters of 46.4 nm, 90.4 nm, and 182.8 nm, respectively. Additionally,
   the sharp peak of the XRD confirmed the crystallinity of the
   nanoparticles. Further bio-assays were conducted to study the
   anti-thrombolytic activity of the TtSN-particles. The results showed
   that the TtSN-particles significantly reduced the formation of blood
   clots in the veins compared to the control groups. These nanoparticles
   also exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive
   (Streptococcus mutans) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli).
   They possessed high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, as
   confirmed by performing a DPPH assay and Heat hemolysis assay,
   respectively.

AB Nano-biomaterials are used in medical applications due to their
   antioxidative characteristics, biocompatibility, biodegradability,
   stability, and other biological properties. In this investigation,
   innovative scaffolds were prepared using sodium alginate (SA), pectin,
   and selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs). The scaffolds underwent
   characterization employing a variety of techniques. The FTIR spectra of
   the scaffolds revealed the substantial differences in various chemical
   groups adsorbed onto the SeNP surface function as stabilizing agents
   within the scaffold. In the XRD results, alginate-pectin (AP),
   alginate-pectin-sodium alginate-decorated selenium nanoparticle
   (AP-SA-SeNP), and alginate-pectin-pectin-decorated selenium nanoparticle
   (AP-PET-SeNP) scaffolds showed amorphous. SEM analysis demonstrated that
   the scaffolds featured solid-walled matrices and a smooth surface.
   Thermal stability assessments revealed that the AP, AP-SA-SeNP, and
   AP-PET-SeNP scaffolds exhibited good thermal stability, with maximum
   decomposition occurring at 250 degrees C. Tensile strength measurements
   resulted in 6.8 N for AP, 5.6 N for AP-SA-SeNPs, and 6.7 N for
   AP-PET-SeNPs. The AP-SA-SeNP scaffold exhibited superior DPPH scavenging
   activity compared to AP-PET-SeNPs, indicating robust antioxidant
   properties. Both scaffolds demonstrated more significant antioxidant
   activity than AP alone. The AP-SA-SeNP scaffold showed enhanced cell
   adhesion, proliferation, and viability compared to AP-PET-SeNPs in the
   C2C12 cell line. These outcomes suggest that the AP-SA-SeNP and
   AP-PET-SeNP scaffolds hold potential for diverse cardiovascular tissue
   engineering applications.

AB Arthritis is a common worldwide medical condition characterized by joint
   inflammation, which can be either acute or chronic. It is frequently
   linked with discomfort and physical breakdown. Arthritis can be
   categorized into many forms such as rheumatoid, osteoarthritis, gouty
   arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory arthritis. Arthritis,
   irrespective of its type, shares common characteristics like monocyte
   infiltration, inflammation, synovial membrane edema, joint stiffness,
   and articular cartilage deterioration. Untreated chronic arthritis can
   lead to disability as a result of cartilage and bone deterioration in
   the joints. It can result in a diminished quality of life due to
   increased oxidative stress, along with several cardiovascular and other
   issues. Conventional pharmaceuticals face several formulation issues,
   such as limited solubility and permeability, inadequate bioavailability,
   degradation caused by gastrointestinal enzymes, interactions with food,
   and toxicity. In order to address these difficulties, scientists have
   shifted their focus to the utilization of vesicular nanocarriers called
   transferosomes which possess excellent elasticity and flexibility. This
   review article highlights about the pathophysiology that underlies the
   development of three forms of arthritis: rheumatoid arthritis,
   osteoarthritis, and gouty arthritis. This review paper also examines the
   risk factors and pharmaceutical interventions for different types of
   arthritis. This review article discusses the utilization of
   transferosomes in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,
   and gouty arthritis.

AB Background: Ultrasound (US) is a medical imaging modality that plays a
   crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer. The emergence of
   numerous deep learning systems has offered promising avenues for the
   segmentation and classification of breast cancer tumors in US images.
   However, challenges such as the absence of data standardization, the
   exclusion of non-tumor images during training, and the narrow view of
   single-task methodologies have hindered the practical applicability of
   these systems, often resulting in biased outcomes. This study aims to
   explore the potential of multi-task systems in enhancing the detection
   of breast cancer lesions. Methods: To address these limitations, our
   research introduces an end-to-end multi-task framework designed to
   leverage the inherent correlations between breast cancer lesion
   classification and segmentation tasks. Additionally, a comprehensive
   analysis of a widely utilized public breast cancer ultrasound dataset
   named BUSI was carried out, identifying its irregularities and devising
   an algorithm tailored for detecting duplicated images in it. Results:
   Experiments are conducted utilizing the curated dataset to minimize
   potential biases in outcomes. Our multi-task framework exhibits superior
   performance in breast cancer respecting single-task approaches,
   achieving improvements close to 15% in segmentation and classification.
   Moreover, a comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art reveals
   statistically significant enhancements across both tasks. Conclusion:
   The experimental findings underscore the efficacy of multi-task
   techniques, showcasing better generalization capabilities when
   considering all image types: benign, malignant, and non-tumor images.
   Consequently, our methodology represents an advance towards more general
   architectures with real clinical applications in the breast cancer
   field.

AB In the landscape of advancing healthcare, characterized by prolonged
   life expectancy and technological strides, healthcare insurance stands
   as a cornerstone, enabling individuals to access crucial medical
   services. The increasing prevalence of fraudulent activities in
   healthcare insurance claims has led to the implementation of stringent
   and complex claiming procedures. The detection of fraudulent activities
   carried out by healthcare claim providers is paramount. This paper
   proposes a novel solution: an ensemble learning-based approach fortified
   by blockchain security for healthcare insurance claim fraud detection.
   Leveraging decentralized blockchain technology ensures robust data
   security, safeguarding confidential healthcare and patient information.
   The efficacy of our methodology is assessed through a comparative
   analysis, pitting ensemble learning techniques specifically bagging
   classification and stacking against conventional individual Machine
   Learning Algorithms (MLAs). Moreover, our innovative approach goes
   beyond traditional methods by integrating various forms of patient data,
   including inpatient data, out-patient data, and beneficiary data. This
   comprehensive integration enhances the real-world applicability of our
   solution, providing a more holistic perspective on healthcare insurance
   claim fraud detection. The evaluation encompasses diverse performance
   metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, Receiver Operating
   Characteristic (ROC), 11-score, and the confusion matrix. Additionally,
   a comprehensive cost assessment is conducted on the integrated smart
   contract functionalities. This study introduces a resilient and
   efficient approach to combat fraudulent activities in healthcare
   insurance claims.

AB Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a neglected tropical disease and
   remains one of the leading causes of cardiovascular-related deaths in
   Ethiopia. This study aims to assess the burden of RHD and identify its
   determinants in the country. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was
   employed from January 5 to April 15, 2023, among cardiac patients
   attending Jimma Medical Center. Socio-demographic data were collected
   using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire and
   echocardiographic patterns were taken by senior cardiologists. Data were
   entered into Epidata Version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25.0 for
   analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regressions were
   performed. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   Accordingly, the most frequent morbidities were RHD (n = 95, 27.9 %),
   hypertensive heart disease (n = 92, 27.1 %), ischemic heart disease (n =
   54, 15.9 %), and dilated cardiomyopathies (n = 54, 15.9 %). Further,
   female sex [AOR = 3.06: 95 % CI 1.73-5.47], using wood (biomass fuel)
   for cooking [AOR = 1.94: 95 % CI 1.10-3.42], history of malnutrition
   with follow-up at a health facility [AOR = 3.90: 95 % CI 2.22-6.86],
   dental caries [AOR = 2.09: 95 % CI 1.12-3.87], and living in crowded
   households [AOR = 2.02: 95 % CI 1.15-3.52] were identified as the
   determinants of RHD. This finding suggests that focusing on female
   healthcare, reducing biomass fuel exposure, improving nutritional
   status, providing regular dental care, and improving living conditions
   could help reduce the impacts of the disease. Moreover, conducting
   further research regularly will also benefit the community at large.

AB Background: In clinical research, prevention of data errors is paramount
   to ensuring reproducibility of trial results and the safety and efficacy
   of the resulting interventions. Over the last 40 years, empirical
   assessments of data accuracy in clinical research have been reported,
   however, there has been little systematic synthesis of these results.
   Although notable exceptions exist, little evidence exists regarding the
   relative accuracy of different data processing methods. Methods: A
   systematic review of the literature identified through PubMed was
   performed to identify studies that evaluated the quality of data
   obtained through data processing methods typically used in clinical
   trials. Quantitative information on data accuracy was abstracted from
   the manuscripts and pooled. Meta-analysis of single proportions based on
   the Freeman-Tukey transformation method and the generalized linear mixed
   model approach were used to derive an overall estimate of error rates
   across data processing methods used in each study for comparison.
   Results: A total of 93 papers (published from 1978 to 2008) meeting our
   inclusion criteria were categorized according to their data processing
   methods. The accuracy associated with data processing methods varied
   widely, with error rates ranging from 2 errors per 10,000 fields to
   2,784 errors per 10,000 fields. MRA was associated with both high and
   highly variable error rates, having a pooled error rate of 6.57% (95%
   CI: 5.51, 7.72). In comparison, the pooled error rates for optical
   scanning, single-data entry, and double-data entry methods were 0.74%
   (0.21, 1.60), 0.29% (0.24, 0.35) and 0.14% (0.08, 0.20), respectively.
   Conclusions: Data processing methods may explain a significant amount of
   the variability in data accuracy. MRA error rates, for example, were
   high enough to impact decisions made using the data and could
   necessitate increases in sample sizes to preserve statistical power.
   Thus, the choice of data processing methods can likely impact process
   capability and, ultimately, the validity of trial results.

AB Brevibacillus laterosporus is a sporulating bacteria, with typical
   canoe-shaped parasporal bodies attached to the spores. It has shown
   great biotechnological potential, including its broad pathogenic
   spectrum against different orders of insects and other invertebrates
   with medical-veterinary-sanitary importance. The high degree of
   synanthropy of muscoid dipterans and the damage they cause being a
   source of myiasis and carriers of pathogens encourage research into
   their population control. The objective of the study was to evaluate the
   histopathological effects caused by B. laterosporus NRS 590 on larvae
   and adults of M. domestica and C. megacephala. The flies were collected
   in garbage dumpsters, identified and the respective colonies were
   adapted to laboratory conditions (airconditioned chamber with regulated
   humidity and temperature). Different concentrations of bacterial spore
   suspensions were offered to neo larvae and adults. Larvae and adults
   were dissected and intestinal epithelial cells of the flies, in temporal
   kinetics, were demonstrated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   techniques. Irregular microvilli were observed in the intestines of both
   adult and larvae tested after 6 h of treatment. At 12 h and 24 h,
   intense cellular disorganization was observed and at 24 h and 48 h there
   was discontinuity of microvilli, cell extrusion and nuclear damage in
   some cells, as well. Spores of B. laterosporus NRS590 produce
   histopathological effects on both larvae and adults of synanthropic
   flies, being an alternative active principle in eco-friendly
   insecticides.

AB Nowadays, metal-based composites are utilized in medical applications
   such as dental implant, oral surgery, and dentistry. This work looks
   into the evolution of grain structure and hardness of Ni and Mg layers
   from the surface to the center of Ni-based and Mg-based laminated
   composites processed by eight cycles of accumulative roll bonding (ARB)
   technique. The findings showed a gradual decrease in grain size from the
   surface to the center of composites. Moreover, the lowest grain sizes of
   Ni and Mg were obtained when they were in the matrix of composites that
   were closer to rollers. Also, the hardness of layers grew by increasing
   the cycles. The layers closer to the surface of composites showed higher
   hardness. Nonetheless, the variations of hardness values were also
   observed because of the slicing and re-stacking of composites prior to
   each cycle.

AB This study investigates the boundary layer flow of a second-order
   magnetic nanofluid containing gyrotactic microorganisms and carbon
   nanotubes, aiming to enhance biosensor performance for medical
   diagnostics. Current biosensor technologies face limitations in
   sensitivity, accuracy, and reliability, which this research seeks to
   address by integrating carbon nanotubes into magnetic nanofluids to
   improve the electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties of diagnostic
   devices. A boundary layer analysis is performed using numerical
   simulations to examine the effects of key parameters, i.e., magnetic
   field, heat source, porous medium, and viscous dissipation on fluid
   behavior. The study employs boundary layer approximations and
   non-similarity transformations to convert the governing partial
   differential equations into dimensionless, nonlinear ordinary
   differential equations (ODEs), which are solved using MATLAB's bvp4c
   technique. The results demonstrate that an increased magnetic number,
   heat source, and Eckert number enhance heat transfer, as indicated by a
   higher Nusselt number, while variations in fluid parameters show complex
   thermal interactions. The skin friction coefficient increases with
   higher fluid parameters, porosity, and magnetic field strength,
   indicating stronger fluid-solid interactions. Additionally, the study
   finds that higher porosity and magnetic field strengths reduce velocity
   profiles, while increasing magnetic field, Eckert number, porosity, and
   heat source raises the temperature profile. The Schmidt and Soret
   numbers significantly influence concentration distribution, with
   opposite effects. This research contributes to the advancement of
   medical biosensors by providing a deeper understanding of the fluid
   dynamics involved in nanofluid-based systems.

AB Medical simulation education allows trainees to work together in teams,
   and to practise assuming the roles of leader and followers, while
   completing real-world scenarios designed to develop the skills needed to
   be effective in clinical practice. Despite the importance of residents
   developing leadership skills to optimize performance and patient
   outcomes, gaps exist in our understanding of how leadership affects
   teamwork dynamics, and how leadership skills are observed during crisis
   resource management (CRM) medical simulation training. Research often
   frames medical education training from the perspective of self-regulated
   learning (SRL) and socially shared regulated learning (SSRL) framework,
   but there is a need to use theory-guided approaches to how SRL and SSRL
   can be used to teach leadership skills. This study explored how the SRL
   and SSRL strategies employed by leaders influence teams during CRM
   medical simulation education scenarios. Eight second-year internal
   medicine residents were observed as they engaged in two CRM simulations
   within a high-fidelity medical education simulation environment. The
   research team observed behaviours, SRL and SSRL strategies, and the
   leadership and communication skills of the leaders. Behavioural and
   regulatory coding using the SRL/SSRL group regulation perspective showed
   that more successful CRM leaders made more frequent use of
   communication, organizational and group regulation strategies and were
   thus able to utilize the assets of their team more effectively than
   leaders who used these skills less frequently. SRL and SSRL are
   under-examined frameworks in medical and simulation education. Our
   current case-based analyses illustrate that these frameworks can provide
   a valuable lens to examine and better understand team behaviours in
   these contexts. Future work will continue to explore whether the
   educational applications of SRL/SSRL group regulatory strategies can
   improve CRM leadership.

AB Introduction: The wellbeing of medical trainees has come into sharp
   focus in recent years, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Workforce pressures are well documented, as is the need to retain staff.
   There are a number of initiatives to try and improve the wellbeing of
   staff, including the introduction of wellbeing and education dellows for
   stage 1 internal medicine trainees in some regions. We recognise that
   there is often a gap between what is offered and what is wanted or
   accessed by trainees.
   Objective: This work aims to identify what 'wellbeing' means to this
   group of staff, and to provide evidence for interventions that they
   would find useful.
   Methods: We distributed a survey to the target group of staff in London,
   followed by a series of structured interviews and focus groups. We used
   a practical thematic analysis to explore the determining factors of
   trainee wellbeing.
   Results: 156 trainees responded to the survey, and 15 participated in
   the interviews and focus groups. Seven themes were identified: culture,
   helplessness and distrust, individual circumstances, physiological
   needs/safety, rotas and work patterns, stress at work, and value.
   Conclusion: This study identifies several key factors related to medical
   trainee wellbeing. To our knowledge, it is the first looking
   specifically at stage 1 internal medicine trainees in the UK.

AB Background: Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are identified as high
   risk for Staphylococcus aureus infection, including MRSA. An outbreak of
   MRSA was identified when two patients experienced MRSA infection
   concurrently in a cardiothoracic high dependency unit with uncommon
   detection of MRSA previously and an established screening programme.
   Methods: An outbreak control team was convened and interventions applied
   including refresher training in hand and environmental hygiene, review
   of practice with regard to aseptic access of medical devices and
   consideration of antibiotic use in the unit. MRSA isolates were referred
   to the Irish National MRSA Reference Laboratory where spa typing
   assigned all isolates to t1597 and whole genome sequencing assigned them
   to multilocus sequence type ST72-MRSA-IV. Recovery of this strain from
   only this unit in Ireland and infrequent reporting in Europe prompted
   staff MRSA screening with two staff members found to harbour the
   outbreak strain. Despite successful decolonisation, recolonisation and
   further transmission to patients occurred. Conclusions: In the clinical
   unit in which this outbreak occurred, the usual control measures to
   prevent spread of MRSA were in place. Recent Joint Healthcare Infection
   Society and Infection Prevention Society Guidance does not recommend
   routine staff screening for MRSA but does support its consideration in
   an outbreak of an unusual strain. In total, 9 patients and 2 staff were
   affected by this outbreak. There were 4 infections and 3 deaths.
   Sustained outbreak closure was necessary to protect certain national
   clinical programmes and was achievable only when colonised staff were no
   longer working in the unit. <feminine ordinal indicator> 2024 The

AB Serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) is an apolipoprotein which is involved in
   amyloid A amyloidosis (AA) by forming fibrils. The process of
   fibrillation is still being explored and holds challenges in recombinant
   expression and purification of SAA1. This study deals with the
   preferable approach for the expression and purification of SAA1 which is
   normally toxic and unstable to express without using any fusion-tag.
   Complete soluble expression of SAA1 was obtained without the use of
   additional tag, in terrific broth, supplemented with 3 % ethanol at 30
   degrees C. Soluble fraction of SAA1 was initially treated with
   salting-out using ammonium sulphate giving 1.5 M salt concentration to
   avoid SAA1 protein precipitation along with unwanted proteins. The
   soluble fraction of SAA1 after salting-out was purified by two
   individual chromatographic approaches: One anion exchange and second
   reverse phase chromatography. The yield of purified SAA1 was 3 times
   greater by anion exchange than reverse phase chromatography. MALDI-TOF
   analysis of purified SAA1 showed 11813 Da for intact protein and
   proteome analysis revealed greater than 90 % sequence coverage by
   MASCOT. The subunit interaction showed hexamer form at basic pH which
   was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography. The fibrillation activity
   of SAA1 was found to be 10-15 times higher in basic media at 43 degrees
   C than 37 degrees C. Our research demonstrates successful expression and
   purification of wild-type human recombinant SAA1. The cost-effective
   radical approach employed for purification of SAA1 is crucial for
   thorough protein characterization particularly, mechanisms of protein
   aggregation involved in amyloidosis.

AB Background: Whether cannabis substitute or complement alcohol remains
   inconclusive. Little is known about the daily-level associations between
   cannabis and alcohol use by cannabis user type (medical vs. recreational
   use) in people who use alcohol and cannabis within a legalized
   environment. Methods: Adult participants were from four waves of
   Washington Panel Survey during 2014-2016, who consumed both cannabis and
   alcohol in the past six months. Daily measurements of alcohol and
   cannabis use in the past week were collected at each wave. Our outcome
   variable was continuous alcoholic drinks, the exposure was any cannabis
   use. We applied three-level negative binomial models to account for
   within-person wave-towave and between-person variations, deriving pure
   within-person within-wave associations between cannabis and alcohol use
   at the daily level. A cross-level interaction between day-level cannabis
   use and wave-level medical cannabis recommendation investigated the
   potential differential substitution/complementarity patterns by medical
   recommendation status. Results: 259 respondents with 440 person-waves
   and 3,051 daily observations were included. We found a statistically
   significant pure Level 1 (within-person daily-level) effect of cannabis
   use among recreational cannabis users (IRR = 1.37, 95 % CI: 1.05-1.79, p
   = 0.02), showing a complementary use pattern. We also found a
   statistically significant cross-level interaction between medical
   cannabis recommendation and cannabis use at Level 1 (IRR = 0.57, 95 %
   CI: 0.34-0.96, p = 0.03), indicating that, differently from recreational
   users, medical cannabis users may have a substitution use pattern.
   Conclusions: Cannabis user type may inform co-use patterns. This study
   suggested recreational cannabis users tended to use alcohol and cannabis
   in a complementary manner in Washington State following the legalization
   of recreational use.

AB The profound impact of AI technology on human life, from daily routines
   to professional settings, necessitates a corresponding evolution in
   education, where the content must adapt to the advancements in AI
   technology. Given high school students' status as digital natives,
   understanding their perspectives is invaluable for planning suitable
   lessons and informing policy formulation in education. This study
   therefore aimed to investigate high school students' knowledge,
   perceptions, and acceptance of the application of AI in medicine and
   agriculture. Questionnaires and interviews were used to explore
   students' perspectives. Data were collected from 373 students (aged
   15-17), and the results indicated that their understanding of AI was
   limited: approximately 64 percent of participants could not identify the
   meaning of 'AI'. Moreover, students were more reluctant to accept the
   use of AI in medicine. However, students' acceptance improved
   significantly when the context of the questions involved humans in AI
   decision-making. Nonetheless, the analysis showed a positive correlation
   between students' perceptions of the benefits and acceptance of AI
   applications in both the agricultural and medical domains. These
   findings underscore the importance of incorporating discussions on
   emerging AI technologies into high school science curricula, helping
   cultivate students' fundamental understanding of emerging technological
   advancements and knowledge, thereby facilitating societal progress.

AB Background: As fundamental documents in clinical trials, clinical trial
   protocols are intended to ensure that trials are conducted according to
   the objectives set by researchers. The advent of large models with
   superior semantic performance compared to traditional models provides
   fresh perspectives for research recommendations in clinical trial
   protocols. Method: A clinical trial protocol recommendation system based
   on Large Language Models (LLMs) is proposed in this paper, combining
   GPT-4 and knowledge graph to assist in clinical trial protocol
   recommendations. Using knowledge graphs as an auxiliary tool, a finite
   set of clinical trial projects with similar features is identified.
   Subsequently, through the semantic capabilities of GPT-4, targeted
   recommendations are made to patients. Results: Experiments were
   conducted to compare GPT-4 and multiple models from the SBERT family
   that handle semantic similarity. The results indicate that GPT-4 is
   capable of better sorting clinical trial protocols based on similarity
   criteria and offering targeted recommendations to patients.
   Consequently, this capability meets the matching requirements between
   projects and patients and enhances the automation of clinical trial
   protocol recommendations. Additionally, in the future, personal factors
   of patients will be fully considered during the recommendation process
   to provide more accurate and personalized protocol recommendations.
   Conclusion: By integrating knowledge graphs and LLMs, a better
   understanding and processing of clinical trial protocol information can
   be achieved, enabling the recommendation of appropriate protocols for
   patients and enhancing both matching efficiency and accuracy.
   Furthermore, the application of this system contributes to the
   automation of clinical trial protocol recommendations, playing a crucial
   role in medical research institutions such as clinical trial research
   institutes and public health management departments. Additionally, it
   significantly aids in advancing the development of clinical trials and
   the medical field at large.

AB Introduction: The escalating use of Computed Tomography (CT) has
   promoted higher radiographer workload, which can contribute to an
   increase of risks such as stress, job dissatisfaction, and potential
   health and safety issues. This study aimed to assess the impact of
   organizational, spatial, and temporal factors on procedures and workload
   in a CT unit, emphasizing patient safety and radiographer well-being.
   Addressing time pressure and optimizing workplace ergonomics are crucial
   in maintaining a balance between efficiency and quality, ensuring safe
   practices in modern medical imaging units. Methods: The study was
   conducted in a Swiss university hospital CT unit and employed the
   Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model to
   analyse the radiographers' workflow and time constrains. Observations
   and tasks' analysis were used to collect data, including timing and
   location of tasks performed by radiographers. Results: The
   radiographers' workflow in the CT department is complex, involving
   multiple tasks. The entire process spans from 26 to 41 min but the
   Machine-Time (time spent inside the CT room) ranged from 10 to 16 min.
   The study identified inefficiencies in the workflow, namely in time
   spent on patient preparation and unsuited machine- time rate. The layout
   of the department, including limited space in the preparation area,
   contributing to ergonomic challenges for radiographers. Organizational
   factors, such as scheduling practices, also impacted workflow. The
   examination durations varied by type of scan and patient, leading to
   time pressure and potential safety concerns. Conclusions: The study
   highlighted the need for more realistic time allocation in CT
   examinations to improve patient and radiographer safety. Recommendations
   include extending machine-time rate, adapting examination durations
   based on the type of CT, and assigning a dedicated radiographer for
   order review. It is also crucial improving the working environment to
   accommodate ergonomic needs. Addressing these issues can enhance the
   efficiency and safety of CT departments, benefiting both patients and
   radiographers. Implications for Practice: Healthcare organizations
   should consider these study recommendations to improve the efficiency
   and safety of CT departments. By implementing the recommended changes,
   such as adjusting CT-time rate and optimizing working environments,
   radiographer satisfaction and patient safety can be increased,
   ultimately leading to safer and more effective CT services.

AB Introduction: The importance of travel for mental and physical health
   and the adverse impacts of transport on health are increasingly
   recognised policy and practice, but less attention is paid to the
   effects of disability on the ability to travel. Methods: We searched the
   TRID database on June 1, 2023, using abstract keywords 'disability' or
   'disabilities'. We used the index term 'literature reviews' in 'all
   publications' from 2019 to 2023 inclusive. We also searched the journal
   Transport Reviews, finding six reviews, and were informed two additional
   reviews. We repeated the search in July 2024, using Google Scholar.
   Forty-three unique recent reviews examined travellers with physical or
   cognitive disabilities; 24 met our inclusion criteria and underwent
   quality appraisal. Results: Travel behaviour differs between transport
   users with and without disabilities. Those with disabilities make 10-30%
   fewer trips. They tend to use different transport modes and travel to
   nearer destinations but their journeys often take more time, are more
   complex, and can cost more. Individuals with disabilities are less able
   to travel both locally and regionally. This reduces independence,
   increases unemployment, and leads missed medical appointments. Travel
   barriers vary with type and severity of disability, socioeconomic
   status, and transport infrastructure quality. People with disabilities
   often use familiar routes for comfort. Systemic obstacles include public
   transport unreliability; long waiting times; maintenance issues (e.g.
   pavement [sidewalk] maintenance, vehicle accessibility equipment);
   accessibility and affordability; and poor access to technology and
   information. Training for people with disabilities and transport staff
   is beneficial. Conclusions: The United Nations Convention on the Rights

AB Gluten proteins in cereal grains are often considered unsafe for health.
   Indeed, the dissemination of misinformation through various sources has
   led to a widespread misconception that the consumption of gluten by
   healthy individuals results in adverse health consequences and
   contributes to obesity. In recent years, many health-conscious consumers
   have started reducing or avoiding gluten consumption without a medical
   recommendation. Consequently, the adoption of gluten-free diets has
   expanded significantly. This study compared 39 gluten-free products and
   their gluten-containing counterparts for energy, sugar, dietary fiber
   content, and price. We found that, on average, gluten-free products
   available to United States consumers contained significantly less
   protein and more sugar and calories. Furthermore, on average,
   gluten-free products are more expensive than gluten-containing products.
   Our finding may serve as a guide for dietitians, nutritionists, and
   legislators in introducing a gluten-free prescription list for
   individuals with celiac disease, wheat allergy, and non-celiac wheat
   sensitivity.

AB Theoretical investigations were carried out for the production of the
   medically important 89 Zr radionuclide. This radionuclide is produced in
   the interaction of a proton projectile with 89 Y-target, a readily
   available target with greater purity at approximate to 5-60 MeV. The 89
   Y (p, n)89Zr production route, a promising avenue in the fields of
   medical imaging and radiopharmaceutical development, is of significant
   interest due to its potential to produce 89 Zr, a radionuclide with a
   half-life of 78.41 h, suitable for various applications. The
   TALYS-1.95(G) predicted production cross-sections were in very good
   agreement with the experimental cross-sections. This successful
   alignment was further confirmed by a strong positive Pearson's
   correlation between the TALYS-1.95(G) predicted and experimentally
   measured production cross-sections for 89 Zr radionuclide produced via
   the 89 Y (p, n)89Zr route. Furthermore, the calculations of thick target
   yields have provided crucial information. It was confirmed that up to
   approximate to 38 MBq/mu Ah maximum production yield of 89 Zr
   radionuclide, free from radio-isotopic impurities, can be achieved in
   the approximate to 5-13 MeV energy window. This information is not just
   essential, but it's profoundly enlightening for understanding the
   potential production capacity of the 89 Y (p, n)89Zr route. It also
   guides us in planning practical supply options for medical applications
   using a small-sized cyclotron at proton-energies <= 13 MeV, enhancing
   our collective knowledge.

AB IntroductionPrimary cervical serous carcinoma was initially described as
   a morphologically distinct entity resembling serous carcinomas elsewhere
   in the female genital tract [FGT]. Recently, this histological subtype
   has been excluded from the latest WHO classification. It is suggested
   that this entity represents metastasis or extension of a serous
   carcinoma of the upper genital tract including the fallopian tube,
   ovary, endometrium, or peritoneum.AimTo retrospectively review
   malignancies of female genital tract presenting as serous carcinomas of
   the uterine cervix.Materials and methodsElectronic medical records of
   patients diagnosed with serous carcinomas of FGT involving cervix in the
   department of gynaecologic oncology at a tertiary centre between 2011
   and 2023 were reviewed.ResultsThere were six women with serous carcinoma
   of FGT involving the cervix. Mean age was 55 years, and all were
   postmenopausal. Five patients presented with blood-stained white
   discharge per vagina. Clinically all patients presented with a
   proliferative growth on the cervix which was distinct from the regular
   appearance of squamous cell carcinomas of cervix. None of the patients
   had ascites/abdominal disease. Histopathologic assessment was suggestive
   of high-grade serous carcinomas in all the cases. Immunohistochemistry
   revealed that all the cases were metastatic-four out of six cases being
   primary endometrial carcinoma and the other two-primary fallopian tube
   carcinomas. Three out of the six women received neoadjuvant chemotherapy
   in view of parametrial involvement, and the other three underwent
   primary debulking surgeries.ConclusionAtypical appearance of cervical
   growth/with serous histology needs thorough evaluation as ascertaining
   the site of primary origin of the tumour is of utmost importance in
   planning optimum treatment. All cases of serous carcinoma of cervix
   included in this study were primaries from upper genital tract. This
   supports the exclusion of primary cervical serous carcinomas from the
   2020 WHO classification.

   patients, and drug decision-making in cancer pain management remains
   challenges. This study aims to develop machine learning models using
   realworld clinical data and prior knowledge to support drug
   decision-making in cancer pain management. Methods: Clinical records
   from the Xiangya Hospital information system and a specialized cancer
   pain platform were used to develop two machine learning models: one for
   patients newly experiencing pain and one for patients with inadequate
   pain control. A total of 10,317 clinical records were used for model
   training, and 1,000 external records were obtained from the Cancer
   Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences for validation.
   Model performance was evaluated based on accuracy, AUC, and brier score.
   Results: Decision Tree and Gradient Boosting algorithms were selected
   for the two models, achieving an average accuracy of 98.47% and 94.74%,
   respectively, with AUCs of 99.62% and 94.74%. External validation
   accuracy was 97.4% and 93.1%, respectively, with AUCs of 99.83% and
   97.01%. Conclusion: The models proposed in this study can serve as
   decision support tools for healthcare professionals, assisting
   physicians in making optimized medication decisions in the absence of
   pharmacists.

AB Background and purpose: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs)
   are an array of conditions affecting the human locomotor system, such as
   muscles, tendons, nerves, bones, and joints. It is related to
   physiological, kinesiological and biomechanical changes which result in
   pain, paresthesia, inflammation, weakness, tiredness, heaviness in
   limbs, fatigue, reduced range of motion and/or compression of peripheral
   nerves. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects
   of positive (massage gum) or negative pressure (vacuum therapy) combined
   with laser on the health of workers with back pain, investigating pain
   intensity, shoulder mobility, spinal flexibility, life quality, and
   well-being. Methods: Twenty-one workers (female and male) aged between
   20 and 60 years and who had medical referral for pain complaint in low
   back, neck and shoulders due to WMSDs participated in this study and
   were randomized into 3 groups: (1) Positive Pressure plus Laser Group
   (PPL): positive pressure using a massage gun was applied after the
   laser; (2) Negative Pressure plus Laser Group (NPL): negative pressure
   by vacuum was applied together with the laser and; (3) Control group
   (CG): without positive and negative pressure treatments or laser
   therapy. All workers received an educational booklet with postural
   orientation and suggestions focused on stretching exercises. Anamnesis,
   visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess pain intensity, and functional
   tests to assess spine flexibility and shoulders mobility were performed.
   Quality of life and well-being also were evaluated. The regions of
   lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine were treated once a week, totaling
   seven sessions. Results: The main result was a reduced pain and an
   increased spinal flexibility, shoulders mobility, and quality of life in
   the PPL and NPL groups compared to the CG (p < 0.05). Furthermore, NPL
   showed better results compared to PPL (p < 0.05) for lumbar and cervical
   pain, as well as for right shoulder mobility. Conclusion: Therefore,
   laser combined with negative pressure massage was more effective in
   reducing lumbar and cervical pain and increasing shoulder mobility
   compared to positive pressure massage in workers.

AB Cyanide is a potent and rapidly acting toxin that poses significant
   risks to biological systems. The development of a sensitive and
   selective chemiluminescence probe for cyanide detection in living cells
   is crucial for both environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics.
   Herein, we have designed and synthesized a novel reaction- based
   chemiluminescent probe, LCN-2, for the detection of cyanide ions (CN-)
   in various samples, including aqueous solutions and food. LCN-2 exhibits
   high sensitivity and selectivity towards cyanide, with a detection limit
   of 294 nM, significantly lower than the World Health Organization (WHO)
   standard of 1.9 mu M. The probe's reliability was validated by measuring
   cyanide concentrations in food samples, demonstrating superior accuracy
   compared to fluorescence assays. Additionally, LCN-2 successfully imaged
   CN- in living cells, underscoring its potential for biological
   applications. These findings highlight the immense value of LCN-2 for
   future use in environmental and medical detection of cyanide, providing
   a highly effective tool for monitoring cyanide levels with precision.

AB Micro-pattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs), when integrated with optical
   imaging sensors, have been proven to effectively and accurately capture
   radiation beam information. To address the challenges of monitoring the
   dose and profile of medical pencil proton beams (MPPB), which have a
   high density of greater than 109 Hz/cm2, an optical readout micro-mesh
   gaseous structure (ORM) was proposed. A Micromegas prototype was
   manufactured with a glass substrate coated with transparent indium tin
   oxide as the detector anode. Its effective area is 8 cm x 8 cm. The ORM
   was firstly characterized with an Iron-55 X-ray source (55Fe) and a
   silver target X-ray tube individually, good energy resolution of 14.5%
   (FWHM), high gain greater than 104, and spatial resolution of 400 mu m
   (10% MTF) were achieved. The prototype was then tested with the MPPB.
   The evaluation revealed linear dose responses exceeding 99% (R-squared
   value) for both single-point and nine-point beam spots at various beam
   energies and doses. The size and center position deviation of the
   nine-point spot measurement were within 0.35 mm and 1 mm, respectively,
   indicating the good potential of this method for MPPB spot quality
   assurance. Additionally, the ORM is expected to be expanded to monitor
   other types of high-flux beams, such as medical neutron and gamma beam
   inspections, by adding suitable conversion layers.

   edema, nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy), and from controls were
   expertly graded and distinguished into 3 groups. Our methodological
   approach involved a nested multiclass five fold cross-validation
   classification scheme. Main Outcome Measures: Area under the curve
   (AUC).<br /> Results: The optimal performance of our algorithm was
   observed using 30 epochs, complemented by an early stopping mechanism to
   prevent overfitting. Our model followed a multiclass approach,
   distinguishing among the 3 different classes: control, CRAO, and
   differential diagnoses. The evaluation was conducted by the "one vs.
   all" area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC)
   method. The results demonstrated AUC of 0.96 (95% confidence interval
   [CI], +/- 0.01); 0.99 (95% CI, +/- 0.00); and 0.90 (95% CI, +/- 0.03)
   for each class, respectively.<br /> Conclusions: Our machine learning
   algorithm (MLA) exhibited a high AUC, as well as sensitivity and
   specificity in detecting CRAO and the differential classes,
   respectively. These findings underscore the potential for deploying MLAs
   in the identification of less common etiologies within an acute
   emergency clinical setting.

AB The random vector functional link (RVFL) network is a prominent
   classification model with strong generalization ability. However, RVFL
   treats all samples uniformly, ignoring whether they are pure or noisy,
   and its scalability is limited due to the need for inverting the entire
   training matrix. To address these issues, we propose granular ball RVFL
   (GB-RVFL) model, which uses granular balls (GBs) as inputs instead of
   training samples. This approach enhances scalability by requiring only
   the inverse of the matrix of GBs' centers and improves robustness
   against noise and outliers through the coarse granularity of GBs.
   Furthermore, RVFL overlooks the dataset's geometric structure. To
   address this, we propose graph embedding GB-RVFL (GE-GB-RVFL) model,
   which fuses granular computing and graph embedding (GE) to preserve the
   topological structure of GBs and enhances the interpretability of the
   proposed model. The proposed GB-RVFL and GE-GB-RVFL models are evaluated
   on KEEL, UCI, NDC and biomedical datasets such as Alzheimer's disease
   diagnosis and breast cancer prediction. The experimental evaluation
   demonstrates that the proposed models outperform baseline models in
   efficacy, robustness, scalability, and interpretability. The source
   codes of the proposed GB-RVFL and GE-GB-RVFL models are available at

AB Titanium alloy was widely used in orthopedics, dentistry, and other
   medical implantation fields because of its suitable mechanical
   properties, excellent corrosion resistance, and reasonable cost.
   However, it has poor wear resistance, suboptimal biocompatibility, and
   inability to eliminate inflammation, which will lead to undesirable
   implantation failure. Here, we designed a novel multifunctional bionic
   hydrogel coatings inspired by the threelayer structure of the blood
   vessel wall to enhance the surface function of titanium alloy. The
   results of in vitro wet friction experiments show that the bionic
   hydrogel coatings, especially the introduction of TiO2-modified
   nanoparticles changed structure of the hydrogel covering can
   significantly reduce the coefficient of friction and improve the wear
   resistance. Moreover, the introduction of TiO2 nanoparticles can
   regulate the swelling property of the hydrogel coatings, realize the
   controlled release of drugs, and improve corrosion resistance. In
   addition, the synergistic action of chitosan and TiO2 nanoparticles in
   the hydrogel endows the surface of titanium alloy with excellent
   antibacterial properties, which the antibacterial rates against E. coli
   and S. aureus reached 98.44 % and 96.27 %, respectively. These features
   herald the potential value of bionic composite hydrogel coatings for

AB Lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs or LFAs) have become indispensable in
   point-of-care medical diagnostics, but improving their sensitivity
   remains a critical challenge. In this work, we present a strategy to
   enhance LFA sensitivity by introducing novel oxidative coupling-based
   chromogenic substrates for horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-based enzymatic
   sensitivity enhancement. Motivated by the requirement for more sensitive
   and costeffective LFAs, we developed substrates inspired by the
   chemistry of permanent oxidative hair dyes. These substrates consist of
   two components: a primary intermediate and a coupler that undergo an
   oxidative coupling reaction in the presence of H2O2, catalyzed by HRP,
   to generate an intensely colored dye. LFAs employing these substrates
   outperformed conventional substrates (3,3 '-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and
   3,3 ',5,5 '-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB)) and achieved an unprecedented
   sub-ng/mL limit of detection (LoD) for human IgG as a model analyte.
   LFAs employing these novel substrates could detect human IgG at 0.16
   ng/mL (1.07 pM), significantly surpassing reported sensitivities in the
   literature. These LFAs also exhibit over 40 times improved sensitivity
   compared to standard gold nanoparticle-based LFAs. Moreover, these
   substrates are about 10,000X more costeffective than their conventional
   counterparts, thus making them a compelling choice for point-of-care
   diagnostics in low-resource settings.

AB The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a major global health
   concern for which accurate viral load monitoring is essential for the
   management of HIV infection. The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART)
   has transformed once-fatal HIV disease into a manageable chronic
   condition that now makes the need for VL testing which aims to satisfy
   international suppression targets 95-95-95 al l the more essential.
   Therefore, considering the complexity and diversity of HIV infection, it
   is essential to develop rapid diagnostic technologies suitable for
   different clinical situations. Here, we report on a multiplexed PCR
   device developed for simple and efficient quantification of HIV-1 or
   HIV-2 viral loads using finger-pricked whole blood from rural
   decentralized settings. This device is comprised of a previously
   developed RNA extraction module combined with an optimized realtime PCR
   amplification system. Together, these combine to simultaneously detect
   and differentiate HIV-1 & 2; as well are adopting a testing control of
   RNase P allowing for full diagnostic analysis from one sample. Our
   device also includes an intuitive user interface and is completely
   autonomous so it can serve individuals in remote areas who are
   unfamiliar with the field of medical testing. They get the results in a
   very short time of around 70 min and hence save on testing times without
   leaving accuracy behind. The efficiency and effectiveness of the device
   were validated through the analysis of 30 clinical samples, yielding a
   sensitivity of 100% for both HIV-1 and HIV- 2. The specificity was found
   to be 100% for HIV-1 and 90.91% for HIV-2, demonstrating high diagnostic
   accuracy. One of the most attractive things about this device is that it
   comes in comparison to all other counterparts. Given that you can run
   the assay for less than $10, it could be an economically viable way to
   use this as a broadscale test in regions where healthcare budgets don't
   allow others. Hence it is quite a useful device to aid HIV management in
   resource-limited settings, where conventional laboratory facilities are
   out of reach due its simplicity and affordability with rapid output. The
   point-of-care test is an effective, low-cost, high quality diagnostic
   tool-promoting rapid testing for HIV-inexpensively overcoming the
   barriers to efficient control of and care in resource-limited settings.

AB Ammonia sensors are widely used across applications in food monitoring,
   environmental surveillance, and medical research, where high safety
   standards are essential. Cellulose-based materials are particularly
   wellsuited to meet these stringent requirements, with significant
   potential for innovation due to their biodegradability and
   biocompatibility. Of the various cellulose-based ammonia sensors
   available, self-powered sensors, especially those based on triboelectric
   nanogenerators (TENGs), stand out for their unique advantages, including
   the absence of an external power supply, environmental sustainability,
   and ease of integration. This review offers a detailed overview of the
   integration of cellulose-based materials with ammonia-sensitive
   components, highlighting their ease of processing and modification. It
   further classifies and compares cellulose-based ammonia sensors based on
   their sensing mechanisms, emphasizing TENG-based sensors specifically.
   The review concludes with a summary of current applications and explores
   optimization strategies. Finally, it discusses future opportunities and
   challenges for cellulose-based self-powered ammonia sensors and provides
   valuable insights into ongoing innovation and potential.

AB Background: The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI)
   as clinical decision support systems (CDSS) into telemedicine presents a
   significant opportunity to enhance clinical outcomes, yet its
   application remains underexplored. Objective: This study investigates
   the efficacy of one of the most common generative AI tools, ChatGPT, for
   providing clinical guidance during cardiac arrest scenarios. Methods: We
   examined the performance, cognitive load, and trust associated with
   traditional methods (paper guide), autonomous ChatGPT, and
   clinician-supervised ChatGPT, where a clinician supervised the AI
   recommendations. Fifty-four subjects without medical backgrounds
   participated in randomized controlled trials, each assigned to one of
   three intervention groups: paper guide, ChatGPT, or supervised ChatGPT.
   Participants completed a standardized CPR scenario using an Augmented
   Reality (AR) headset, and performance, physiological, and self-reported
   metrics were recorded. Main Findings: Results indicate that the
   Supervised-ChatGPT group showed significantly higher decision accuracy
   compared to the paper guide and ChatGPT groups, although the scenario
   completion time was longer. Physiological data showed a reduced LF/HF
   ratio in the Supervised-ChatGPT group, suggesting potentially lower
   cognitive load. Trust in AI was also highest in the supervised
   condition. In one instance, ChatGPT suggested a risky option,
   highlighting the need for clinician supervision. Conclusion: Our
   findings highlight the potential of supervised generative AI to enhance
   decision-making accuracy and user trust in emergency healthcare
   settings, despite trade-offs with response time. The study underscores
   the importance of clinician oversight and the need for further
   refinement of AI systems to improve safety. Future research should
   explore strategies to optimize AI supervision and assess the
   implementation of these systems in real-world clinical settings.

AB During intravascular procedures, medical devices interact mechanically
   with vascular tissue. The device design faces a trade-off: although a
   high bending stiffness improves its maneuvrability and deliverability,
   it may also trigger excessive supra-physiological loading that may
   result in tissue damage. In particular, the collagen fibers in vascular
   walls are load-bearing but may rupture on a microscopic scale due to
   mechanical interaction. When the mechanical load increases even further,
   tissue rupture or puncture occurs. To mitigate tissue damage, the
   current work focusses on the development of computational Finite Element
   (FE) based models wherein state-ofthe-art constitutive tissue models are
   applied toward the design of safe devices. Several experiments are
   presented for tissue characterization in which device-mimicking
   indenters are pressed onto a porcine tissue. In these experiments, the
   Mullins effect, which is related to tissue damage, is observed.
   Consequently, the mechanical behavior of tissue, including the evolution
   of damage-induced energy dissipation, is accurately described by
   adopting a hyperelastic model incorporating the damage approach by
   Weisbecker et al. (2012). From the experimentally validated
   computational model, a novel design criterion is established, which
   allows for safe device development. Furthermore, an energy density
   criterion for the onset of puncture is proposed. With these tools,
   several frequently used work-horse guidewires are numerically evaluated.

AB The effect of multi-frequency electromagnetic environments on male
   reproduction has attracted the medical community's interest. Studies
   have investigated the effects and mechanisms of single-frequency
   microwave exposure on male reproduction, but comparative research on
   high-power microwave (HPM) composite and single exposure remains scarce.
   This study aimed to examine the effects and mechanisms of combined 1.5
   GHz and 4.3 GHz microwave exposure on male reproduction. Male Wistar
   rats were exposed to 1.5 GHz (L-band) and 4.3 GHz (C-band)
   electromagnetic radiation for 15 minutes. The four groups were: sham, 10
   mW/cm2 L-band, 10 mW/cm2 C-band, and 5 mW/cm2 L-band and 5 mW/cm2 C-band
   compound. Assessments were made on the pathological structures of
   testes, sperm viability, serum sex hormones, oxidative stress, and
   energy metabolism levels after radiation. Exposure to 1.5 GHz and 4.3
   GHz microwaves individually resulted in testicular tissue damage and
   reduced sperm quality. There was little difference between the damage
   caused by HPM composite and single exposure. The exposed groups showed
   histological and ultrastructural changes, with reduced spermatozoa
   viability, motility parameters, and serum testosterone, luteinizing
   hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and serum inhibin-B on days 1 and
   7 after exposure. These tended to recover partially by day 14. Adenosine
   triphosphate content and lactate dehydrogenase and succinate
   dehydrogenase activities in the exposed testicular tissue decreased,
   corresponding to decreased superoxide dismutase activity and increased
   malondialdehyde content. Both single and combined exposure to L- and
   C-band HPM affect the male reproductive system. Exposure to single and
   compound HPM shows no significant difference in risks, with oxidative
   stress and energy metabolism disturbances playing key roles.

AB Academic Medical Centers (AMCs) - comprising medical schools, teaching
   hospitals, and research laboratories - play an important role in US
   biomedical innovation. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 changed
   reimbursements for Medicare inpatient claims and subsidies for medical
   residents. We compare AMCs' relative exposure to the reform, how these
   differences affect their researchers' ability to attract NIH grant
   funding, and the quantity, impact, and content of their publications. We
   find that in response to the reform, research activity increased by
   approximately 6%. Changes in research composition suggest that hospitals
   responded to Medicare funding cuts by encouraging incumbent
   investigators to increase their research activities and by redirecting
   hiring efforts towards individuals attracted to AMCs (e.g.,
   translational researchers). We find little effect on clinical outcomes.

AB Nanobiomaterials play a crucial role in healthcare, offering exceptional
   applications in advanced diagnostics, targeted drug delivery, tissue
   engineering, imaging, and hyperthermia therapy. Iron oxide
   nanocrystalline clusters (IONC) have emerged as a versatile and
   promising class of nanobiomaterials due to their unique properties at
   the nanoscale enabling precise interactions with biological systems,
   thereby paving the way for innovative medical applications. The
   interactions of these nanomaterials with the cells, tissues, and
   microenvironment can reveal the biocompatibility or harmful effects
   within the biological systems; therefore, a systematic understanding of
   the toxicity parameters of these materials is essential. The
   solvothermal synthesized IONC was characterized and assessed for in
   vitro cytotoxicity on HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines as well as in vivo
   toxicity on Swiss albino mice. The average size of synthesized
   superparamagnetic IONC was found to be 230 nm from TEM analysis. These
   clusters exhibited promising efficiency for magnetic hyperthermia, with
   a SAR value of 104.1 W/g and an intrinsic loss parameter of 1.05 nH
   m2/kg-1. The particles did not exhibit significant toxicity when tested
   on both cell lines. Blood parameter values remained within normal limits
   at 24 h, 5, and 75 weeks in the in vivo study. Histopathological
   evaluation using Perl's stain revealed a dose-dependent iron
   accumulation in the liver and spleen, indicating these organs as the
   primary sites for iron metabolism, thereby contributing to its
   biocompatibility and non-toxicity. The result from the current study
   reveals that the synthesized silica-coated IONC can be efficiently used
   for hyperthermia application due to its biocompatibility as they do not
   show any significant in vitro or in vivo toxicity.

AB Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a task that recognizes
   different sub-categories under the same macro-category, and it has a
   wide range of applications in fields such as ecological research,
   medical diagnosis, and security monitoring. It requires algorithms that
   recognize subtle differences in objects of the same category, usually
   manifested as localized and complex image patterns. However, existing
   methods still face challenges in dealing with subtle differences between
   categories, especially in the presence of significant variations and
   background noise in images. This study aims to propose a new Mask-Guided
   Context-Enhanced Multiscale Transformer (MCM-ViT) model to address the
   above issues. Our approach improves classification accuracy through
   three key innovations: the Differential Attention Selector (DAS)
   optimizes feature selection in the multi-head self-attention mechanism;
   the Context Enhancement Module (CEM) enhances contextual associations
   among tokens; and the Mask Bootstrap Module (MBM) reduces the effect of
   background noise by directing the attention mechanism to focus on
   foreground information. We conducted experiments on four standard FGVC
   datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, NABirds and Stanford
   Cars. The experimental results show that MCM-ViT achieves 0.3%, 0.7%,
   and 0.2% accuracy improvement on these datasets, respectively, which are
   all better than the current state-of-the-art. In addition, our model
   demonstrates stronger robustness and generalization ability when dealing
   with images with complex backgrounds. MCM-ViT achieves significant
   performance gains in fine-grained visual classification tasks through
   accurate local feature capture and global context fusion. Future work
   will focus on further reducing the model parameters, simplifying the
   architecture, and exploring combinations with other backbone networks to
   improve the efficiency and generalization ability of the model.

   leprosy-related pathological lesions in the cemetery of Sant Lla`tzer
   Hospital (12th-18th c.); and to examine how individuals affected by the
   disease were perceived and integrated into society during that period in
   Barcelona. Materials: The skeletal remains of 87 individuals recovered
   from the cemetery. Methods: All remains were analysed macroscopically
   and, when required, radiographed. Results: Of the total number of
   individuals (n=87), 21 (24.1 %) showed evidence indicative of leprosy.
   Notably, the frequency of leprosy cases was lower in the 13th-15th c.
   (10 %; n = 50), the only period for which multiperson graves were
   documented. Conclusions: The frequency of leprosy-related lesions in
   Sant Lla`tzer is similar to that observed in other European Christian
   leprosaria, although it varies across the centuries. There is no
   funerary evidence that leprosy sufferers were treated differently than
   other citizens. Significance: The cemetery of Sant Lla`tzer, the first
   in Spain directly linked to a leprosarium, uniquely spans a significant
   period of activity. Its exceptionally preserved remains and rich records
   have offered unparalleled insight into the disease and its profound
   social implications. Limitations: Leprosy affects the bone in only a
   small percentage of untreated cases. Moreover, poor preservation of
   skeletal remains may prevent diagnosis. Suggestions for Further
   Research: Biochemistry, genomics, and proteomics might provide new
   insights into the disease, the origin and migrations of the individuals
   buried in Sant Lla`tzer, as well as other aspects of their daily lives.

   remains a significant medical and societal concern despite medical
   advancements such as antibiotic discovery. Drug resistance and the

   attention. Therefore, there has been a surge in the development of
   materials with anti-biofouling properties. These materials have
   undergone significant advancements and are specifically designed to
   combat bacteria and prevent biofilm formation. Modern technologies like
   photothermal modification with photodynamic agents and quaternary

   anti-biofouling mechanisms by combining nature-inspired modifications
   with multiple anti-biofouling strategy. By combining these strategies,
   the resulting coatings can exhibit enhanced anti-biofouling efficacy and
   improved durability. The purpose of this review is to evaluate various
   nature-inspired surface modifications designed to enhance resistance to
   fouling. It will assess the limitations of each approach and contemplate

AB Cross-conjugated flavonoids exhibited higher bioactivities in certain

   could promote human health. Conjugated porous polymer (CPP) served as an
   excellent adsorbent for N,N,N ',N '-tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED)
   due to its porous properties, large specific surface areas, and highly
   delocalized it-it conjugated skeleton. The constructed TEMED-CPP
   distinguished between flavonoids with or without cross conjugation. This
   method showed good linearity (R2 >= 0.979), low detection limits
   (0.19-1.84 mu g/mL) and acceptable intraday and interday precision (<=
   9.97 %). Density functional theory and molecular planarity calculations
   indicated that degree of conjugation, planarity, and energy band gap of
   flavonoids collectively influenced their response sensitivity to
   TEMED-CPP. Additionally, CPP could be recycled and subsequently reloaded
   with TEMED for the next detection after its initial use. The rapid
   identification of cross-conjugated flavonoids could guide the extraction
   and enrichment processes of highly bioactive flavonoids from natural
   sources, which improved extraction efficiency and economic benefits.

   rates and patient outcomes, yet in resource-limited settings, the
   scarcity of medical resources often leads to late-stage diagnosis.
   Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with smartphonebased imaging

   detection in smartphone-based imaging. However, these compact smartphone
   systems face challenges like low imaging quality and restricted

   optical and computational limitations of smartphone-based imaging
   systems provides promising solutions. AI-based cancer detection also
   faces challenges. Transparency and reliability are critical factors in
   gaining the trust and acceptance of AI algorithms for clinical

AB This study addresses the sustainable medical waste location and
   transportation (SMWLT) problem from the viewpoint of social risk,
   environmental impact, and economic performance, where model uncertainty
   includes risk and transportation costs. In practice, it is usually hard
   to obtain the exact probability distribution of uncertain parameters. To
   address this challenge, this study first constructs an ambiguity set to
   model the partial distribution information of uncertain parameters.
   Based on the constructed ambiguity set, this study develops a new
   multi-objective distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) model
   for the SMWLT problem. Subsequently, this study adopts the robust
   counterpart (RC) approximation method to reformulate the proposed DRCC
   model as a computationally tractable mixed-integer linear programming
   (MILP) model. Furthermore, an accelerated Benders decomposition (BD)
   enhanced by valid inequalities is designed to solve the resulting MILP
   model, which significantly improves the solution efficiency compared
   with the classical BD algorithm and CPLEX solver. Finally, a practical
   case in Chongqing, China, is addressed to illustrate the effectiveness
   of our DRCC model and the accelerated BD solution method.

AB Introduction: Chondrosarcoma is the second most common primary bone
   cancer with the lungs being the primary site of metastasis. Pancreatic
   metastases can occur, but their rarity makes management challenging.
   Presentation of case: A 27-year-old female with a past medical history
   of childhood chondrosarcoma of her left tibia presented with metastatic
   chondrosarcoma of the pancreas five years later. The patient underwent
   an upfront Whipple procedure with positive margins. Upon recovery, her
   oncology team recommended watchful waiting. One year later, she
   presented to the emergency department with coffee ground emesis and
   diffuse abdominal pain. A computed tomography scan showed a large
   recurrent mass at the pancreatic remnant concerning for local
   recurrence. Upper endoscopy found active bleeding near the
   gastrojejunostomy anastomosis with no ulcers as well as portal
   hypertensive gastropathy. After discussing these findings, the patient
   ultimately declined any further treatment, and she was discharged to
   hospice. Discussion: This is the second reported case of a Whipple
   procedure for metastatic chondrosarcoma, and first with positive margins
   (R1). It appears that chondrosarcoma metastasis to the pancreas
   requiring Whipple procedure is associated with poor outcomes. This
   unfortunate result is further compounded by the lack of neoadjuvant or
   adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation in the setting of R1 resection.
   Conclusion: Upfront Whipple procedure in metastatic chondrosarcoma at
   high risk for R1 resection should be considered with neoadjuvant
   radiation Adjuvant radiation can be considered if there are positive
   margins.

AB People with depression have increased premature mortality and elevated
   prevalence of diabetes-mellitus compared to general population. However,
   risk of mortality and diabetes-related complications among patients with
   depression and co-occurring diabetes is under-studied. This
   population-based propensity score- matched (1:10) cohort study
   identified 12,175 patients with pre-existing depression and
   incident-diabetes (depression-diabetes group) and 117,958 patients with
   incident-diabetes only (diabetes-only group) between 2002 and 2021 in
   Hong-Kong, using territory-wide medical-record database of
   public-healthcare services, to investigate whether depression increased
   the risk of overall mortality, complications and post-complication
   mortality in people with diabetes. Associations of depression with
   all-cause mortality, complication and post- complication all-cause
   mortality rates were examined by Cox proportional-hazards model.
   Complications were assessed by Diabetes-Complications-Severity-Index
   (DCSI). Associations of complications, in terms of DCSI scores
   (complication burden), specific types and two-way combinations of
   complications (complication patterns) with all-cause mortality rate in
   depression were also examined. Our results showed that
   depression-diabetes group exhibited increased all-cause mortality risk
   (adjusted hazards-ratio: 1.06 [95 %CI: 1.02-1.10]) relative to
   diabetes-only group, particularly among men and older age group, with
   significantly higher rate of experiencing neuropathy (1.44 [1.27-1.62])
   and metabolic complications (1.30 [1.09-1.56]) and lower likelihood of
   peripheral-vascular complications, retinopathy and nephropathy, albeit
   comparable macrovascular and micro- vascular complication rates. The
   mortality-rate-ratio for patients with depression and diabetes was
   significantly higher than patients with diabetes-only at a low level of
   complication burden. In conclusion, depression patients with
   co-occurring diabetes are at increased risk of excess mortality. Further
   research is warranted to improve diabetes-related outcomes and reduce
   mortality gap in this vulnerable population.

AB Introduction: Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the
   pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital heart disease that in
   most cases manifests in the first months of life, being a well-studied
   entity of myocardial ischaemia in young patients. It has been reported
   that up to 90 % of infants die without treatment in the first year,
   although late diagnosis is increasingly reported in adults. Case
   summary: We present the case of a 23-year-old woman of Moroccan origin
   with no medical history of interest, who was admitted to the cardiac
   intensive care unit after an episode of sustained ventricular
   tachycardia (VT) that required electrical cardioversion. On admission,
   the electrocardiogram and blood test were normal, but the transthoracic
   echocardiogram showed moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction and
   severe mitral regurgitation of rheumatic aetiology which was later
   confirmed with a transesophageal echocardiogram. In view of the
   arrhythmic event presented, a complete study was performed with cardiac
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which showed no pathological
   enhancements. Nevertheless, coronary artery angiography revealed an
   anomalous origin of the left coronary artery in the pulmonary artery
   which was confirmed by cardiac computed tomography (CT). Corrective
   surgery was performed with direct translocation of the left coronary
   artery to the aorta and mitral valve replacement. Discussion: In ALCAPA,
   the coronary steal phenomenon produced from the pulmonary artery to the
   coronary circulation causes myocardial ischaemia and involves a
   left-to-right shunt. Myocardial ischaemia is cause of angina, systolic
   dysfunction, mitral regurgitation and sudden cardiac death in children
   and young adults.

AB Background: Allergy code systems are essential for safety and medical
   information interoperability. However, current terminology systems lack
   allergens unique to Japan. Objective: This study established a code
   system encompassing Japanese food and non-food/non-medication allergens
   (JFAGY), and developed a meta-code system for integration with existing
   drug code systems. The practicality and limitations of the JFAGY were
   assessed by profiling HL7 FHIR allergy intolerance. Methods: Allergen
   terms were selected based on the Standard Commodity Classification of
   Japan. Additional terms were extracted from clinical guidelines and
   public documents. For non-food, non-medication allergens, terms from the
   clinical guidelines were manually compiled to conform to a
   classification hierarchy. To validate the coverage of the developed food
   allergen code system, we extracted 823 unique food allergens, totaling
   12,027 entries, from two years of electronic health records (EHRs) and
   performed manual mapping to the code system. Results: In total, 1,123
   food and 607 non-food/non-medication allergen terms were included. The
   three-digit meta-code system comprises an identifier for coding systems,
   code length, and allergen categories. The codes allowed the
   determination of hierarchical relationships between any two terms. The
   Japanese allergy intolerance value set was developed and bound to the
   allergy intolerance code. Of the food allergens extracted from EHRs,
   62.9% corresponded to unique codes, 6.1% to multiple codes, and 31.0%
   were unmapped, accounting for 91.5%, 1.9%, and 6.6% of entries,
   respectively. Conclusions: The JFAGY encompasses Japanese-specific food
   and non-food/non-medication allergens, enabling hierarchy determination
   between two terms, and playing a critical role in medical safety. When
   utilizing the JFAGY with the FHIR allergy intolerance resource, an FHIR
   extension must be included to denote a denied allergy.

   partitions, selecting the one with the most appropriate number of
   clusters is based on appropriately modified existing fuzzy indexes. In
   addition, the Fuzzy Mahalanobis Minimal Distance index is defined as a
   natural extension of the recently proposed Mahalanobis Minimal Distance
   index for non-fuzzy clustering. The new fuzzy Mahalanobis incremental
   algorithm was tested on several artificial data sets and the color image
   segmentation problems from real-world applications: art images, nature
   photography images, and medical images. The algorithm includes multiple
   usage of the global optimization algorithm DIRECT. But unlike previously
   known fuzzy Mahalanobis indexes, the proposed Fuzzy Mahalanobis Minimal
   Distance index ensures accurate results even when applied to complex
   real-world applications. A possible disadvantage could be the need for
   longer CPU time. Furthermore, besides effective identification of the
   partition with the most appropriate number of clusters, it is shown how
   to use the proposed Fuzzy Mahalanobis Minimal Distance index to search
   for an acceptable partition, which proved particularly useful in the
   above-mentioned real-world applications.

   skins, healthcare, and noncontact detection. In this study, novel 3D
   flower-like SnS2/Ti3C2 MXene nanocomposites are fabricated via an
   in-situ hydrothermal synthesis strategy. The nanostructural,
   morphological and compositional properties of the SnS2/Ti3C2 MXene
   composites illustrate the doping of Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets on the
   surface of SnS2 nanoflowers, which increases the adsorption sites for
   water molecules. The results of the humidity sensing experiments reveal
   that the capacitive response of SnS2/Ti3C2 MXene is optimal when the
   mass ratio of Ti3C2 MXene is 20 %. Moreover, the SnS2/Ti3C2 MXene
   composite film sensor has an ultrahigh capacitance response with an
   amplitude increase of three orders of magnitude compared with the pure
   SnS2 sensor, and a wide detection range of 7-93 % relative humidity.
   Complex impedance spectroscopy, bode diagrams and Schottky junction
   theory are employed to understand the potential sensing mechanisms of
   the SnS2/Ti3C2 MXene composite under various humidity conditions. With
   the highly sensitive and rapid humidity sensing capability, the prepared
   respiratory detection system could effectively monitor respiratory
   patterns, confirming its potential application in the field of medical
   health. Moreover, the non-contact sensing system prepared based on a 4 x

AB Objective: This paper presents an overview of generalizable and
   explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in deep learning (DL) for
   medical imaging, with the aim of addressing the urgent need for
   transparency and explainability in clinical applications. Methodology:
   We propose to use four CNNs in three medical datasets (brain tumor, skin
   cancer, and chest x-ray) for medical image classification tasks.
   Furthermore, we combine ResNet50 with five common XAI techniques to
   obtain explainable results for model prediction, in order to improve
   model transparency. We also involve a quantitative metric (confidence
   increase) to evaluate the usefulness of XAI techniques. Key findings:
   The experimental results indicate that ResNet50 can achieve feasible
   accuracy and F1 score in all datasets (e.g., 86.31 % accuracy in skin
   cancer). Furthermore, the findings show that while certain XAI methods,
   such as eXplanation with Gradient-weighted Class activation mapping
   (XgradCAM), effectively highlight relevant abnormal regions in medical
   images, others, such as EigenGradCAM, may perform less effectively in
   specific scenarios. In addition, XgradCAM indicates higher confidence
   increase (e.g., 0.12 in glioma tumor) compared to GradCAM++ (0.09) and
   LayerCAM (0.08). Implications: Based on the experimental results and
   recent advancements, we outline future research directions to enhance
   the generalizability of DL models in the field of biomedical imaging.

AB Background: Blended learning, integrating face-to-face and virtual
   methods, has become essential in clinical education, enhancing student
   satisfaction, engagement and knowledge outcomes. Particularly, online
   case-based learning emerges as a promising pedagogy to foster clinical
   reasoning skills. Despite the well-documented clinical reasoning
   cultivation through face-to-face case-based learning, the ability of
   online case-based learning to cultivate clinical reasoning remains
   unexplored. This study investigates the role of online case-based
   learning in fostering clinical reasoning skills among clinical-year
   medical students.
   Methods: A mixed-methods sequential explanatory research study was
   adopted. In the first phase, quantitative data were gathered through a
   16-item Likert scale questionnaire adapted from validated clinical
   reasoning questionnaires. In the second phase, focus group discussions
   were conducted to expand on the understanding of quantitative results.
   Results: In total, 160 students completed the questionnaire (45%
   response rate), and 26 participated in focus group discussions.
   Participants agreed that online case-based learning fostered clinical
   reasoning skills (mean = 2.94) through different formats, such as
   clinical role play, simulated ward rounds and virtual consultation.
   Compared to face-to-face clinical teaching, the focus group revealed
   that participants were allowed to practise giving explanations to
   patients, engage in more in-depth discussions, and receive more
   comprehensive feedback on their clinical reasoning skills during online
   case-based learning. The barriers to online clinical reasoning skills
   development were poorer communication skills development and reduced
   student engagement. The lack of patient complexities of cases and the
   inability to perform physical examinations hindered students' clinical
   reasoning ability. Suggestions to improve clinical reasoning cultivation
   include utilising actual patient cases, increasing case complexity and
   session interactivity.
   Conclusion: This study highlights how online case-based learning can
   support the development of clinical reasoning skills in medical
   students, encouraging future educators to adopt a blended learning
   approach. Future research should focus on objective assessments,
   long-term impacts and innovative methods to improve clinical reasoning
   skill development continuously.

AB Accurate identification of intraoperative tumor lesions and effective
   treatment are crucial for improving surgical outcomes. Near-infrared
   (NIR) fluorescence imaging demonstrates advantages over traditional
   medical approaches in tumor interventions, garnering significant
   attention. However, clinically available imaging agents are generally
   limited by their "always on" characteristics, which can lead to
   non-specific imaging interference and "false-positive" results. In this
   context, we present a glutathione-activated NIR-II probe, LJ-GSH,
   designed for metastatic tumor imaging and specific imaging-guided tumor
   resection. LJ-GSH initially exhibits quenched fluorescence due to the
   weak electron-donating effect of the thiophenol moiety, which is
   recovered at 815/ 910 nm upon activation by the overexpressed levels of
   glutathione (GSH) in tumor cells and tissues, significantly enhancing
   the specificity of tumor imaging. This unique characteristic positions
   LJ-GSH as a reliable fluorescent sensor for monitoring GSH dynamics
   during physiological events. Notably, the probe's NIR-II emission
   feature markedly improves imaging contrast and resolution, facilitating
   real-time identification and imaging of lung metastatic lesions. With
   the aid of high-specific NIR-II imaging guidance, tumor tissues can be
   precisely resected, with the residual negative margin diameter reduced
   to approximately 0.2 mm. We envision that our tailored probe may offer
   an attractive option for clinical applications.

AB Background: C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory biomarker
   frequently used in clinical practice. However, insufficient
   evidence-based ordering inevitably results in its overuse or underuse.
   This study aims to predict its normal and abnormal levels using the deep
   neural network (DNN) models, helping clinicians order this item more
   appropriately and intelligently. Methods: We considered complete blood
   count (CBC) parameters as feature vectors and 10 mg/L as a cutoff value
   for CRP. Several models, including linear support vector classification,
   logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and DNN, were
   developed based on a dataset of 53834 medical records to predict binary
   output. We externally validated DNN models on independent 20723 samples
   through discrimination, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis.
   Results: DNN models has the best area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curves (AUC). Learning curves revealed that models' AUC,
   balanced accuracy, and F1 score do not significantly and continuously
   improve following increasing data volume. In internal validation, the
   AUC, balanced accuracy, and the F1 score of 10 models were 0.818 (0.95

   accuracy shown no significant difference (P-values were 0.106 and

   0.818, and calibration curve formula of y=1.001x-0.010, which was
   identified as a target model to deploy in the app. Conclusions: DNN
   models obtained moderate performance, surpassing baseline indices in
   distinguishing binary CRP levels. They are good generalizations and
   well-calibrated. The CRP-C2 model can enhance CRP utilization by
   informing the orders appropriately and can contribute to inflammatory
   diagnostics in primary health care where CBC is available, but the CRP
   test is inaccessible.

AB Computational insights into the role of magnetized bio-nanofluids,
   specifically involving gold (Au) and iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles is
   crucial in bionanoscience. They have several prominent advantages in
   hemodynamics and are used widely in hyperthermia treatment, advanced
   drug delivery, and many diagnostics purposes. The study delves into the
   intricate mathematical modelling and numerical investigation of
   bio-nanofluid past over a convectively radiative heated permeable
   surface. The research primarily focalized the thermal transport
   mechanism in a hybrid nanofluids under the impact of some key
   influential facts such as convective heating, magnetic field
   orientation, infinite shear rate, and space-dependent heat source. For
   physiological attention, the synthesized fluid (blood) containing gold
   (Au), and iron oxide (Fe3O4) is taken into consideration. The flow
   mechanism is structured through Carreau modelling along with fluid flow
   governing equations such as the Navier-Stokes relation, heat and
   concentration equations. The assembled equations are altered into
   ordinary differential systems (ODEs) by introducing similarity variables
   for numerical treatment. A robust computation framework MATLAB (bvp4c)
   is used to tackle the first order nonlinear system of equations. The
   effect of emerging parameters is analysed for velocity, energy, and
   concentration profiles. The magnetic field strength intensified the
   temperature and velocity profile in both Au/blood and Au-Fe3O4/blood.
   The velocity field is enhanced with angle orientation, whereas the
   converse behaviour is noted for temperature distribution. The Nusselt
   number showed an increasing trend with positive variation with heat
   source and radiation parameter, while the Skin fraction demonstrated
   similar conduct for the Wassenberg number and magnetic parameter. The
   results provide sufficient information, which contributes to the growth
   of bio-nanofluid dynamics with several implications for medical
   sciences.

AB Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is an opportunistic,
   Gram-negative human pathogen, which is predominantly found in hospital
   patients. Its antimicrobial resistance is escalating, leading to less
   efficient treatments, and an increasing interest in identifying new
   therapeutic drugs. Metals as antimicrobials are vital in healthcare and
   agriculture, and copper-containing surfaces are known to reduce
   microbial counts, also in clinical settings. Indeed, copper (Cu) is an
   essential element required for survival in all organisms from bacteria
   to humans, but nevertheless elevated levels are highly toxic for cells.
   Through different regulatory mechanisms, cells maintain Cu homeostasis,
   and ion channels and transporters are critical in this process. Precise
   understanding of such ion transport requires insight into the protein
   structures of the involved proteins, which will also provide information
   important for applied sciences. Considering the medical significance of
   A. baumannii and the possibility to exploit Cu to handle such
   infections, channels and transporters represent appealing targets. Here
   we approached the putative outer membrane CopB (Copper resistance
   protein B) from A. baumannii that is postulated to conduct Cu, with
   characterization of its structure and function as well as to enable
   rational drug-design. To this end, we demonstrate in this work
   procedures to produce purified sample and to recover diffracting protein
   crystals of CopB. The protein was overproduced in E. coli and membrane
   extracted in a range of detergents. The solubilized protein was
   subjected to crystallization, which yielded hits that scatter X-rays to
   low resolution. Our findings have the potential to pave the way for
   subsequent drug discovery.

AB Introduction: This case study describes the clinical, medical and
   administrative management of kidney cancer secondary to occupational
   exposure to trichloroethylene, a chlorinated solvent classified as a
   known carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
   Method: Data were collected from the computerized records of all
   patients treated by the occupational medicine department of Montpellier
   University Hospital for kidney cancer following occupational exposure to
   trichloroethylene. Results: The study included five patients aged
   between 36 and 64 years. Clinical characteristics (histology, stage at
   diagnosis and disease course) were variable. The patients had all been
   exposed to trichloroethylene before the year 2000, with a mean delay to
   diagnosis of 31 years. Conclusion: Kidney cancer is a frequent
   pathology, often discovered by chance, even at metastatic stages.
   Knowledge of occupational risks enables us to set up primary and
   secondary prevention measures (early detection), as well as a specific
   medical and social care pathway. Level of evidence: Not available. (c)

AB The engineering construction of the liver has attracted enormous
   attention. Organoids, as emerging miniature three-dimensional
   cultivation units, hold significant potential in the biomimetic
   simulation of liver structure and function. Despite notable successes,
   organoids still face limitations such as high variability and low
   maturity. To overcome these challenges, engineering strategies have been
   established to maintain organoid stability and enhance their efficacy,
   laying the groundwork for the development of advanced liver organoids.
   The present review comprehensively summarizes the construction of
   engineered liver organoids and their prospective applications in
   biomedicine. Initially, we briefly present the latest research progress
   on matrix materials that maintain the three-dimensional morphology of
   organoids. Next, we discuss the manipulative role of engineering
   technologies in organoid assembly. Additionally, we outline the impact
   of gene-level regulation on organoid growth and development. Further, we
   introduce the applications of liver organoids in disease modeling, drug
   screening and regenerative medicine. Lastly, we overview the current
   obstacles and forward-looking perspectives on the future of engineered
   liver organoids. We anticipate that ongoing innovations in engineered
   liver organoids will lead to significant advancements in medical

AB Medical image segmentation with the convolutional neural networks
   (CNNs), significantly enhances clinical analysis and disease diagnosis.
   However, medical images inherently exhibit large intra-class
   variability, minimal inter-class differences, and substantial noise
   levels. Extracting robust contextual information and aggregating
   discriminative features for fine-grained segmentation remains a
   formidable task. Additionally, existing methods often struggle with
   producing accurate mask edges, leading to blurred boundaries and reduced
   segmentation precision. This paper introduces a novel Edge-guided and
   Hierarchical Aggregation Network (EHANet) which excels at capturing rich
   contextual information and preserving fine spatial details, addressing
   the critical issues of inaccurate mask edges and detail loss prevalent
   in current segmentation models. The Inter-layer Edge-aware Module (IEM)
   enhances edge prediction accuracy by fusing early encoder layers,
   ensuring precise edge delineation. The Efficient Fusion Attention Module
   (EFA) adaptively emphasizes critical spatial and channel features while
   filtering out redundancies, enhancing the model's perception and
   representation capabilities. The Adaptive Hierarchical Feature
   Aggregation Module (AHFA) module optimizes feature fusion within the
   decoder, maintaining essential information and improving reconstruction
   fidelity through hierarchical processing. Quantitative and qualitative
   experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
   EHANet in achieving superior mIoU, mDice, and edge accuracy against
   eight other state-of-the-art segmentation methods, highlighting its
   robustness and precision in diverse clinical scenarios.

AB Current natural language watermarking (NLW) methods generate suitable
   watermark words based on local context using pre-trained models (PLMs),
   minimizing semantic loss in watermarked text. However, these methods
   still exhibit some limitations. Specifically, there is room for
   improvement on substitutes quality and watermark imperceptibility since
   they integrate off- the-shelf lexical substitution (LS) models, which
   are not specifically tailored for watermarking algorithms. They make
   strict synchronization constraints to generate identical substitutes
   list from the original and the watermarked text, and therefore precludes
   consideration of some high-quality substitutes, which curtails the
   watermark capacity. Additionally, the local context changes via
   watermarking embedding, and these methods cannot losslessly recover the
   original text, limiting the application of NLW to high-precision
   scenarios such as government documents, military, and medical
   applications. To address these issues, we propose a reversible
   source-aware NLW approach, which performs proactive mining to identify
   potential reversible watermark positions by virtue of a PLM and
   subsequently embeds the watermark into the text via source-aware LS.
   Also, we have designed a novel LS algorithm tailored for NLW to enhance
   the imperceptibility and textual fidelity of watermarked content.
   Experiments validate the efficiency of our LS method in generating the
   most suitable substitutes and verifies that our NLW approach achieves
   complete reversibility while enhancing watermark capacity and textual
   fidelity compared to prior arts.

AB The objective of accurately diagnosing diabetic macular oedema (DME) is
   to minimize the likelihood of vision loss in affected individuals. The
   use of multicolor images (MCI), which offer a range of spectral
   representations of the fundus, aids in the detection of DME. Advanced
   deep learning algorithms have been developed to classify DME in MCI, but
   they often fall short inaccuracy because they do not fully utilize the
   multifaceted characteristics of these images. This study introduces the
   Multi-feature Decomposition Fusion Attention Network (MDFANet), a novel
   approach for classifying MCI in both healthy individuals and those with
   DME. The MDFANet begins with Restormer blocks to extract initial
   features, then diverges into two pathways: one employing a Lite
   Transformer to capture broad, low-frequency features, and another using
   an Invertible Neural Network to focus on high-frequency details.
   Additionally, we have created a Residual hybrid attention modules module
   that refines feature extraction by integrating sequential Hybrid
   Attention Modules with residual connections in convolutions. This design
   leverages both extensive and localized feature information to enhance
   the analysis of multiple features. Asa result, the MDFANet has proven to
   be effective in the early and accurate detection of DME, which is
   crucial for formulating well-timed treatment strategies and reducing the
   risk of vision impairment for patients.

AB Nuclear technology finds extensive application across various
   industries, medical physics, and research institutions, spanning fields
   such as agriculture and food technology. Despite its benefits, the
   pervasive use of ionizing radiation underscores the need for effective
   shielding materials to mitigate associated risks. Lead and concrete,
   traditionally favored for their attenuation properties, pose challenges
   due to weight, opacity, and toxicity concerns. In this context, calcium
   aluminum barium sodium borate glasses doped with Dy3+ ions emerge as
   promising alternatives for radiation shielding. This study investigates
   the ionizing electromagnetic radiation (gamma and X-ray) shielding
   capabilities of calcium aluminum barium sodium borate glasses doped with
   Dy3+ ions across a range of concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0%
   mol). The mass attenuation coefficients and linear attenuation
   coefficients of four glass samples (S1 to S4) were determined using the
   software (Phy-X). Additionally, parameters such as effective atomic
   number (Zeff), half-value layer (HVL), tenth-value layer (TVL) and mean
   free path (mfp) were computed to assess shielding effectiveness. The
   results indicate that higher Dy3+ concentrations correlate with
   increased attenuation effectiveness, as evidenced by elevated mu and mu
   m values. Glass sample S4, with the highest Dy3+ concentration,
   demonstrated superior shielding properties, attributed to its elevated
   density. Notably, the study elucidates the relationship between
   attenuation coefficients and photon energy, highlighting the dominance
   of photoelectric and Compton scattering effects. Furthermore, analysis
   of HVL, mfp, and Zeff values reveals the nuanced interplay between glass
   composition and radiation attenuation. Despite variations in
   composition, S4 consistently exhibited optimal shielding characteristics
   across photon energy ranges. The investigation also examines exposure
   and energy absorption buildup factors, indicating that higher Dy3+
   concentrations lead to lower buildup values, indicative of enhanced
   shielding performance. In conclusion, the study underscores the
   potential of Dy3+ doped calcium aluminum barium sodium borate glasses as
   effective radiation shielding materials, offering insights into their
   composition-dependent attenuation properties. These findings contribute
   to the development of lead-free alternatives and advance the
   understanding of radiation shielding mechanisms in glass matrices, with
   implications for diverse applications in nuclear technology and beyond.

AB As the "power stations" of the cell, mitochondria are involved in many
   energy metabolism processes. Abnormalities in mitochondrial structure
   and function (mitophagy) can affect the activity of living cells and
   lead to disease. Visualizing the concentration changes in the relevant
   analytes in real time is essential to better understand the
   visualization of mitophagy processes. Several probes have been reported
   for the detection of one or more analytes in mitochondria. However,
   topic has not been summarized. Therefore, it is very important to
   explore the latest progress of small molecule fluorescent probes in this
   emerging field. Based on the role of analytes in mitochondrial
   autophagy, this reviews recent advances in
   single/double/multi-responsive fluorescent probes with specific
   recognition function and selective signal conversion of mitochondrial
   autophagy related analytes (including pH, viscosity, polarity, hypoxia,
   and mitochondrial ROS RSS fluctuations) since 2016. We believe that this

   related to mitochondrial autophagy and provide valuable insights to

   treatment, yet manual interpretation of chest X-rays can be
   time-consuming and prone to errors due to inter-observer variability. To
   address these challenges, this research focuses on automating pneumonia
   diagnosis by leveraging deep learning techniques. X-ray imaging, being a
   key diagnostic tool, is at the center of this study, where we aim to
   improve diagnostic accuracy using a carefully designed Convolutional
   Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Our model, trained on a curated
   dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images, integrates the 'inception_v3 '
   layer for feature extraction with dense layers to build a
   high-performing binary classification tool. To further enhance model
   transparency and clinical utility, we incorporate Integrated Gradients
   (IG) for interpreting the model's decision-making process. With 22.9
   million trainable parameters, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of
   97.23%. The integration of IG provides additional insights by
   identifying critical image regions that influence predictions, boosting
   user confidence in the system's diagnostic recommendations. This

AB PurposeIt is uncertain if quality and barriers of sleep differs based on
   the location of a patient in the hospital. Our aim was to compare the
   patient reported sleep quality (QoS) in non-mechanically ventilated
   patients in ICU and wards, and identify the barriers of sleep in ICU and
   in wards.MethodsThe survey assessed the QoS at three stages including
   the day immediately prior to hospital admission, after their last night
   spent in the ICU prior to discharge, and the first night in wards.
   Visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 to 10 was used, with 0 being
   the 'worst possible sleep' and 10 'best quality sleep'. The patients
   were also asked to identify the barriers to sleep in both ICU and
   wards.Results51 patients were enrolled. The QoS was found to be
   significantly better in the wards than in the ICU [median 6 (IQR 4-8)
   vs. 5 (IQR 3-7), median difference 0.76, p = 0.04], as well as at home
   compared to the ICU [6 (IQR 5-8) vs. 5 (IQR 3-7), median difference 1.12
   p = 0.046]. There was no statistical difference in median QoS at home
   compared to the wards. Noise, being awoken for procedures were the
   commonest barriers to sleep both in the ICU and ward.Medical devices
   (58.8% vs. 32%, p = 0.004) and being disorientated or confused (27.5%
   vs. 10%, p = 0.0135) were largely reported as barriers in ICU compared
   to the wards.ConclusionsQoS in ICU is generally poorer than the wards.
   The use of medical devices and disorientation in ICU were the main
   differentiating factors between the ICU and the wards.

AB To enhance the accuracy of brain tumor diagnosis and treatment, reliance
   on MRI images is crucial. However, human error in manual diagnosis
   remains a concern, underscoring the urgency for robust computer-based
   techniques to enhance accuracy in discerning normal and malignant brain
   tumors. Our paper introduces a novel method, the Attention-Fused
   MobileNet-LSTM model, aimed at improving the classification accuracy. By
   integrating features from two well recognized pre-trained convolutional
   neural network (CNN) models named as MobileNetV1 and MobileNetV2, we
   have developed a reliable model. Our approach addresses challenges in
   CNN training, including high processing demands, difficulty in
   discerning intricate details in images, and diminished efficacy due to
   noise or irrelevant data. Employing a transformer aid in feature
   extraction, while gamma correction before features fusion tackles
   long-range relationship capture between successive features. However,
   proposed model employing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural
   networks (RNN) for direct class label prediction, understanding the
   intermediate features from feature fusion can be challenging, limiting
   model transparency. Leveraging a publicly available brain tumor dataset
   comprising 3,000 MRI images, we conduct augmentation procedures and
   standardization to meet CNN's image resizing prerequisites, thereby
   enhancing dataset diversity and classification task performance. Our
   thorough evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the Attention-Fused
   MobileNet-LSTM model over single base models, feature fusion with and
   without attention, and other methodologies. With a consistent accuracy
   of 98.66%, our proposed model showcases significant potential as a
   reliable tool for precise classification of normal and malignant brain
   MRIs in the medical domain. Additionally, we employ Grad-CAM to
   visualize the key regions prioritized by both the base models and our
   proposed model, offering insights into their decision-making processes.
   Our model achieves high Area Under the Curve (AUC) values in Receiver
   Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, confirming its effectiveness.

AB The field of software engineering is advancing at astonishing speed,
   with packages now available to support many stages of data science
   pipelines. These packages can support infectious disease modelling to be
   more robust, efficient and transparent, which has been particularly
   important during the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a package for the
   construction of infectious disease models, integrated it with several
   open-source libraries and applied this composite pipeline to multiple
   data sources that provided insights into Australia's 2022 COVID-19
   epidemic. We aimed to identify the key processes relevant to COVID-19
   transmission dynamics and thereby develop a model that could quantify
   relevant epidemiological parameters. The pipeline's advantages include
   markedly increased speed, an expressive application programming
   interface, the transparency of open-source development, easy access to a
   broad range of calibration and optimisation tools and consideration of
   the full workflow from input manipulation through to algorithmic
   generation of the publication materials. Extending the base model to
   include mobility effects slightly improved model fit to data, with this
   approach selected as the model configuration for further epidemiological
   inference. Under our assumption of widespread immunity against severe
   outcomes from recent vaccination, incorporating an additional effect of
   the main vaccination programs rolled out during 2022 on transmission did
   not further improve model fit. Our simulations suggested that one in
   every two to six COVID-19 episodes were detected, subsequently emerging
   Omicron subvariants escaped 30-60% of recently acquired natural immunity
   and that natural immunity lasted only one to eight months on average. We
   documented our analyses algorithmically and present our methods in
   conjunction with interactive online code notebooks and plots. We
   demonstrate the feasibility of integrating a flexible domain-specific
   syntax library with state-of-the-art packages in high performance
   computing, calibration, optimisation and visualisation to create an
   end-to-end pipeline for infectious disease modelling. We used the
   resulting platform to demonstrate key epidemiological characteristics of
   the transition from the emergency to the endemic phase of the COVID-19
   pandemic. (c) 2024 The Authors. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V. on

AB The level of surveillance and preparedness against epidemics varies
   across countries, resulting in different responses to outbreaks. When
   conducting an in-depth analysis of microinfection dynamics, one must
   account for the substantial heterogeneity across countries. However,
   many commonly used statistical model specifications lack the flexibility
   needed for sound and accurate analysis and prediction in such contexts.
   Nonlinear mixed effects models (NLMMs) constitute a specific statistical
   tool that can overcome these significant challenges. While compartmental
   models are well-established in infectious disease modeling and have seen
   significant advancements, Nonlinear Mixed Models (NLMMs) offer a
   flexible approach for handling heterogeneous and unbalanced repeated
   measures data, often with less computational effort than some
   individual-level compartmental modeling techniques. This study provides
   an overview of their current use and offers a solid foundation for
   developing guidelines that may help improve their implementation in
   real-world situations. Relevant scientific databases in the
   Research4life Access initiative programs were used to search for papers
   dealing with key aspects of NLMMs in infectious disease modeling (IDM).
   From an initial list of 3641 papers, 124 were finally included and used
   for this systematic and critical review spanning the last two decades,
   following the PRISMA guidelines. NLMMs have evolved rapidly in the last
   decade, especially in IDM, with most publications dating from 2017 to
   2021 (83.33%). The routine use of normality assumption appeared
   inappropriate for IDM, leading to a wealth of literature on NLMMs with
   non-normal errors and random effects under various estimation methods.
   We noticed that NLMMs have attracted much attention for the latest known
   epidemics worldwide (COVID-19, Ebola, Dengue and Lassa) with the
   robustness and reliability of relaxed propositions of the normality
   assumption. A case study of the application of COVID-19 data helped to
   highlight NLMMs' performance in modeling infectious diseases. Out of
   this study, estimation methods, assumptions, and random terms
   specification in NLMMs are key aspects requiring particular attention
   for their application in IDM. (c) 2024 The Authors. Publishing services

AB COVID-19 vaccine-induced protection declines over time. This waning of
   immunity has been described in modelling as a lower level of protection.
   This study incorporated fine- scale vaccine waning into modelling to
   predict the next surge of the Omicron variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
   In Hong Kong, the Omicron subvariant BA.2 caused a significant epidemic
   wave between February and April 2022, which triggered high vaccination
   rates. About half a year later, a second outbreak, dominated by a
   combination of BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, began to spread. We
   developed mathematical equations to formulate continuous changes in
   vaccine boosting and waning based on empirical serological data. These
   equations were incorporated into a multi-strain discrete-time
   Susceptible-Exposed- Infectious-Removed model. The daily number of
   reported cases during the first Omicron outbreak, with daily vaccination
   rates, the population mobility index and daily average temperature, were
   used to train the model. The model successfully predicted the size and
   timing of the second surge and the variant replacement by BA.4/5. It
   estimated 655,893 cumulative reported cases from June 1, 2022 to 31
   October 2022, which was only 2.69% fewer than the observed cumulative
   number of 674,008. The model projected that increased vaccine protection
   (by larger vaccine coverage or no vaccine waning) would reduce the size
   of the second surge of BA.2 infections substantially but would allow
   more subsequent BA.4/5 infections. Increased vaccine coverage or greater
   vaccine protection can reduce the infection rate during certain periods
   when the immune-escape variants co- circulate; however, new
   immune-escape variants spread more by out-competing the previous strain.

AB Introduction: Since November 2023, influenza has ranked first in
   reported cases of infectious diseases in China, with the outbreak in
   both northern and southern provinces exceeding the levels observed
   during the same period in 2022. This poses a serious health risk to the
   population. Therefore, short to medium-term influenza predictions are
   beneficial for epidemic assessment and can reduce the disease burden.
   Methods: A transmission dynamics model considering population migration,
   encompassing susceptible-exposed-infectious-asymptomatic-recovered
   (SEIAR) was used to predict the dynamics of influenza before the Spring
   Festival travel rush. Results: The overall epidemic shows a declining
   trend, with the peak expected to occur from week 47 in 2023 to week 1 in
   2024. The number of cases of A (H3N2) is greater than that of influenza
   B, and the influenza situation is more severe in the southern provinces
   compared to the northern ones. Conclusion: Our method is applicable for
   short-term and medium-term influenza predictions. As the spring festival
   travel rush approaches. Therefore, it is advisable to advocate for
   nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), influenza vaccination, and other
   measures to reduce healthcare and public health burden. (c) 2024 The

AB As public health policies shifted in 2023 from emergency response to
   long-term COVID-19 disease management, immunization programs started to
   face the challenge of formulating routine booster campaigns in a still
   highly uncertain seasonal behavior of the COVID-19 epidemic.
   Mathematical models assessing past booster campaigns and integrating
   knowledge on waning of immunity can help better inform current and
   future vaccination programs. Focusing on the first booster campaign in
   the 2021/2022 winter in France, we used a multi-strain age-stratified
   transmission model to assess the effectiveness of the observed booster
   vaccination in controlling the succession of Delta, Omicron BA.1 and
   BA.2 waves. We explored counterfactual scenarios altering the
   eligibility criteria and inter-dose delay. Our study showed that the
   success of the immunization program in curtailing the Omicron BA.1 and
   BA.2 waves was largely dependent on the inclusion of adults among the
   eligible groups, and was highly sensitive to the inter-dose delay, which
   was changed over time. Shortening or prolonging this delay, even by only
   one month, would have required substantial social distancing
   interventions to curtail the hospitalization peak. Also, the time window
   for adjusting the delay was very short. Our findings highlight the
   importance of readiness and adaptation in the formulation of routine
   booster campaign in the current level of epidemiological uncertainty.

AB Understanding effector and memory immune responses against influenza A
   virus (IAV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
   (SARS-CoV-2) infections and reinfections is extremely important, given
   that they are now endemic in the community. The goal of this study is to
   investigate the role of memory cells and antibodies in the immune
   responses against IAV and SARS-CoV-2 re-infections. To this end, we
   adapt a previously-published within-host mathematical model (Sadria &
   Layton, 2021) for the primary immune response against SARS-CoV-2
   infections, by including two types of memory immune cells, i.e., memory
   CD8 & thorn; T-cells and memory B-cells, and by parametrising the new
   model with values specific to the two viruses. We first investigate the
   long-term dynamics of the model by identifying the virus-free steady
   states and studying the conditions that ensure the stability of these
   states. Then, we investigate the transient dynamics of this in-host
   model by simulating different viral reinfection times: 20 days, 60 days
   and 400 days after the first encounter with the pathogen. This allows us
   to highlight which memory immune components have the greatest impact on
   the viral elimination depending on the time of reinfection. Our results
   suggest that memory immune responses have a greater impact in the case
   of IAV infections compared to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Moreover, we
   observe that the immune response after a secondary infection is more
   efficient when the reinfection occurs at a shorter time. (c) 2024 The

AB As the world recovers from COVID-19, the monkeypox virus presents a new
   global health threat with cases rising daily, but it is less severe and
   contagious than COVID-19, monkeypox could lead to a worldwide epidemic
   if not properly controlled. Early diagnosis plays a key role in
   preventing its spread, and deep learning techniques have proven
   effective in medical imaging for disease detection. However, a major
   challenge is the absence of a publicly available database, lower
   accuracy and higher computational time of existing methods. In this
   manuscript, Optimized Global Aware Siamese Network based Monkeypox
   Disease Classification using Skin Images (OGASN-MDC-SI) is proposed.
   Initially, the data is collected from Monkeypox Skin Images Dataset
   (MSID). The collected dataset images are fed to the image pre-processing
   using Fast Resampled Iterative Filter (FRIF) to remove noise from
   images, then convert images to RGB format and resize images. Then
   Time-Frequency Synchroextracting Transform (TFSET) extracts features,
   such as Grayscale statistic features like skewness, and mean and
   Haralick Texture features like entropy, homogeneity, energy, and
   Contrast. Finally, the feature attributes are given to Global Aware
   Siamese Network (GASN) for classifying the Monkeypox Disease as Normal,
   Monkeypox, Chickenpox, and Measles. Then, the Elk Herd Optimization
   Algorithm (EHOA) is considered to optimize the weight parameters of the
   GASN. The OGASN-MDC-SI method is implemented in Python and evaluated
   under some metrics, like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Area
   under the Curve. The outcomes shows that the OGASN-MDC-SI attains 99.20%
   higher Precision, with 98.96% higher Recall and 98.76% higher F1-score
   compared with the existing methods.

AB The process of detecting brain tumors entails capturing brain images,
   which are then scrutinized to identify any abnormalities. It is crucial
   to develop and validate medical image classification models in
   collaboration with healthcare professionals to ensure their safety and
   effectiveness in clinical settings. These models aid in categorizing the
   disease based on its type, facilitating appropriate treatment decisions.
   While traditional methods for brain tumor detection have been useful,
   they often face limitations in terms of accuracy, scalability, time
   sensitivity, and cost. To overcome these complexities, a novel Stacked
   Random Support Vector-based Hybrid Gazelle Coati (SRS-HGC) algorithm is
   developed to detect brain tumors. This method utilizes feature
   extraction to capture the shape and size of the tumor. Additionally,
   Support Vector Machine. Random Forest, and stacked ensemble techniques
   are employed to classify medical images, into categories such as tumor
   or non-tumor. In this research, the Hybrid Gazelle optimization and
   Coati Optimization algorithms are employed for tuning hyperparameter
   that enhances the efficiency. The analysis are carried out using the
   Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS2020), Br35H, Figshare Brain tumor and
   REMBRANDT datasets. The results are then compared by demonstrating the
   efficiency of the SRS-HGC technique in detecting brain tumor diseases.

AB In recent years, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring has become the most
   effective method of monitoring cardiac rhythm in critically ill
   patients. It can detect a variety of arrhythmias, including atrial and
   ventricular premature beats, myocardial perfusion, etc. Nevertheless,
   the transmission and storage of large amounts of physiological data is a
   major challenge. To maintain signal integrity and increase transmission
   speed, data compression is necessary. Current research is increasingly
   focused on adaptive compression algorithms. These algorithms adapt
   coding strategies based on signal characteristics. ECG data compression
   technique combining empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and discrete
   wavelet transform (DWT) has been proposed. However, the intrinsic mode
   functions (IMFs) component generated from EMD decomposition suffers from
   a mode mixing problem. This paper proposes a scheme for decomposing ECG
   signals using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and
   recombining the components with DWT. The scheme compresses and quantizes
   the ECG signal using a uniform scalar dead-zone quantization method and
   further compresses the data using run- length coding. Evaluation
   parameters indicate that the proposed scheme has superior compression
   performance. Compressed signals can facilitate remote transmission and
   real-time monitoring, providing patients with more convenient medical
   services and promoting the development of healthcare.

   physicochemical and structural properties of composites.
   Photoluminescence, surface area and contact angle measurements were
   carried out. The filtration performances of the membranes were tested
   under infrared light in a continuous flow system. Methyl orange and
   bovine serum albumin solutions were used as model pollutants. The
   silver-graphite additive acted as light absorber and energy converter.
   Owing to the photothermal effect, the water flux, rejection and

AB Deciphering the spectrum and founder disease-causing variants (DCVs) in
   specific populations can shape and facilitate the diagnostic process of
   Lynch Syndrome (LS). The aim of this report was to comprehensively
   update on the genetic landscape of LS in the ethnically diverse
   Israeli-Jewish population. The cohort included 1080 carriers from 588
   families; some from underrepresented, understudied Israeli ethnic groups
   recruited from 8 genetic institutes and high-risk clinics throughout the
   country. Variant classification was performed according to the American
   College of Medical Genetics criteria. A total of 157 DCVs were
   identified, 12 are reported here for the first time, and 9 reclassified.
   MSH2 DCVs were identified in 286 families (49%). Most DCVs (125/157,
   80%) were noted in one or two families only. Sixteen DCVs, each detected
   in >= 5 families, and accounted for LS in 378/588 (64%) families.
   Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMRD) was diagnosed in 7
   families. Twenty-five carriers (2.3%) had an additional DCV or risk
   alleles in another cancer susceptibility gene. In conclusion, MMR gene
   variant distribution in Israel is diverse. MSH2 is most commonly mutated
   due to founder DCVs. Though the 16 prevalent LS-associated DCVs were
   frequently detected in our cohort, none of them is frequently reported
   in the general population. These data should facilitate variant
   interpretation, spouse and cascade testing.

AB The purpose of this study was to test a moderated mediation model. We
   first looked into whether fear of a cancer recurrence mediated the
   effect of time since diagnosis on trauma centrality, a concept rendering
   the impact of cancer on one's self-identity. Secondly, we looked into
   whether the indirect effect would depend on the stage of diagnosis. We
   expected a more pronounced indirect effect for early stages as opposed
   to late stages. We acquired data from 234 cancer survivors (78.02%
   female; Mage= 35.58), who received a cancer diagnosis, were undergoing
   cancer treatment or had finished their treatment. Together with
   demographics and basic medical information, participants completed the
   Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory Short Form (FCRI-SF) and the
   Centrality of Event Scale - the Short - Form (CED-SF). In line with our
   expectations, the results confirmed an indirect effect of fear of cancer
   recurrence which was stronger for survivors in the early stage of
   diagnosis (i.e., I, II) as compared to those in the late stage (i.e.,
   III, IV). Conclusions and Future Directions. The study emphasizes the
   significance of taking into account both the disease stage at diagnosis
   and the length of time since diagnosis when creating interventions to
   help cancer survivors address their fear of cancer recurrence.
   Theoretical ramifications and interpretive limitations are presented.

   age, physical limitations, cost, technical issues, misinterpretation of
   how PainChek (R) works, and influence of family. Facilitators included a
   willingness to use mHealth Apps and previous experience. Some themes
   acted as both barriers and facilitators depending on the situation such
   as the healthcare team's acceptance. Targeted interventions and support
   strategies, leveraging facilitators are essential to overcome barriers
   related to user, intervention, and context and to enhance successful
   PainChek (R) implementation, thereby improving pain management in

AB Scrub typhus is a significant public health issue with a wide
   distribution and is influenced by various determinants. However, in
   order to effectively eradicate scrub typhus, it is crucial to identify
   the specific factors that contribute to its incidence at a detailed
   level. Therefore, the objective of our study is to identify these
   influencing factors, examine the spatial variations in incidence, and
   analyze the interplay of two factors on scrub typhus incidence, so as to
   provide valuable experience for the prevention and treatment of scrub
   typhus in Gannan and to alleviate the economic burden of the local
   population.This study employed spatial autocorrelation analyses to
   examine the dependent variable and ordinary least squares model
   residuals. Additionally, spatial regression modelling and geographical
   detector were used to analyze the factors influencing the annual mean
   14-year incidence of scrub typhus in the streets/townships of Gannan
   region from 2008 to 2021. The results of spatial(1) autocorrelation
   analyses indicated the presence of spatial correlation. Among the global
   spatial regression models, the spatial lag model was found to be the
   best fitting model (log likelihood ratio = -319.3029, AIC = 666.6059).
   The results from the SLM analysis indicated that DEM, mean temperature,
   and mean wind speed were the primary factors influencing the occurrence
   of scrub typhus. For the local spatial regression models, the multiscale
   geographically weighted regression was determined to be the best fitting
   model (adjusted R-2 = 0.443, AICc = 726.489). Further analysis using the
   MGWR model revealed that DEM had a greater impact in Xinfeng and
   Longnan, while the southern region was found to be more susceptible to
   scrub typhus due to mean wind speed. The geographical detector results
   revealed that the incidence of scrub typhus was primarily influenced by
   annual average normalized difference vegetation index. Additionally, the
   interaction between GDP and the percentage of grassland area had a
   significant impact on the incidence of scrub typhus (q = 0.357). This
   study illustrated the individual and interactive effects of natural
   environmental factors and socio-economic factors on the incidence of
   scrub typhus; and elucidated the specific factors affecting the
   incidence of scrub typhus in various streets/townships. The findings of
   this study can be used to develop effective interventions for the
   prevention and control of scrub typhus. (c) 2024 The Authors. Publishing

AB Background: The number of people undergoing voluntary HIV testing has
   abruptly decreased since 2020. The geographical heterogeneity of HIV
   infection and the impact of COVID-19 on the diagnosis of HIV at regional
   level are important to understand. This study aimed to estimate the HIV
   incidence by geographical region and understand how the COVID-19
   pandemic influenced diagnosis of HIV. Methods: We used an extended
   back-calculation method to reconstruct the epidemiological dynamics of
   HIV/AIDS by geographical region. We used eight regions: Tokyo, the
   capital of Japan, Hokkaido plus Tohoku, Kanto plus Koshinetsu (excluding
   Tokyo), Hokuriku, Tokai, Kinki, Chugoku plus Shikoku, and Kyushu plus
   Okinawa. Four different epidemiological measurements were evaluated: (i)
   estimated HIV incidence, (ii) estimated rate of diagnosis, (iii) number
   of undiagnosed HIV infections, and (iv) proportion of HIV infections
   that had been diagnosed. Results: The incidence of HIV/AIDS during the
   COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2022 increased in all regions except
   Kanto/Koshinetsu (51.3 cases/year), Tokyo (183.9 cases/ year), Hokuriku
   (1.0 cases/year), and Tokai (43.1 cases/year). The proportion of HIV
   infections that had been diagnosed only exceeded 90% in Tokyo (91.7%,
   95% confidence interval (CI): 90.6, 93.3), Kanto/Koshinetsu (91.0%, 95%
   CI: 87.3, 97.8), and Kinki (92.5%, 95% CI: 90.4, 95.9). The proportion
   of infections that had been diagnosed was estimated at 83.3% (95% CI:
   75.1, 98.7) in Chugoku/Shikoku and 80.5% (95% CI: 73.9, 91.0) in Kyusyu/
   Okinawa. Conclusions: In urban regions with major metropolitan cities,
   including Tokyo, Kinki, and Kanto/Koshinetsu, the number of undiagnosed
   HIV infections is substantial. However, the proportion of undiagnosed
   infections was estimated to be smaller than in other regions. The
   diagnosed proportion was the lowest in Kyusyu/Okinawa (80.5%), followed
   by Chugoku/Shikoku and Hokkaido/Tohoku. The level of diagnosis in those
   regional prefectures may have been more influenced and damaged by the
   COVID-19 pandemic than in urban settings. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB Background: An influenza forecasting system is critical to influenza
   epidemic preparedness. Low temperature has long been recognized as a
   condition favoring influenza epidemic, yet it fails to justify the
   summer influenza peak in tropics/subtropics. Recent studies have
   suggested that absolute humidity (AH) had a U-shape relationship with
   influenza survival and transmission across climate zones, indicating
   that a unified influenza forecasting system could be established for
   China with various climate conditions. Methods: Our study has generated
   weekly influenza forecasts by season and type/subtype in northern and
   southern China from 2011 to 2021, using a forecasting system combining
   an AH-driven susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model and
   the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF). Model performance was
   assessed by sensitivity and specificity in predicting epidemics, and by
   accuracies in predicting peak timing and magnitude. Results: Our
   forecast system can generally well predict seasonal influenza epidemics
   (mean sensitivity>87.5%; mean specificity >80%). The average forecast
   accuracies were 82% and 60% for peak timing and magnitude at 3-6 weeks
   ahead for northern China, higher than those of 42% and 20% for southern
   China. The accuracy was generally better when the forecast was made
   closer to the actual peak time. Discussion: The established AH-driven
   forecasting system can generally well predict the occurrence of seasonal
   influenza epidemics in China. (c) 2024 The Authors. Publishing services

AB China's rural revitalization strategy emphasizes the integration of
   urban and rural development, with the rural living circle serving as a
   fundamental unit. Public service facilities, especially medical
   services, are crucial for the well-being of rural residents. Essential
   for achieving balanced development and improved living standards, these
   services must ensure equitable access in rural areas, balancing social
   justice with humanitarian considerations. A comprehensive examination of
   their availability and interaction with the living circle is key to
   optimizing these facilities for balanced progress. This study focused on
   Qin'an County, Gansu, China, where it mapped out living circles based on
   residents' travel habits and the levels of medical institutions. It
   analyzed the distribution and accessibility of medical facilities within
   these circles, investigating their correlation with circle radii. The
   findings were aimed at enhancing the spatial layout of medical services,
   yielding three key insights: (1) The spatial layout of rural medical
   facilities in Qin'an County shows a "core-edge" trend, with most areas
   by low accessibility, in contrast to the high accessibility in the urban
   center. (2) A significant negative correlation was identified between
   the accessibility of medical facilities and the radius of the living
   circle; in other words, greater accessibility corresponds to a smaller
   living circle radius. (3) The K-means clustering algorithm proved to be
   an effective method for optimizing the accessibility of medical
   facilities, leading to improved access and more balanced distribution
   across living areas. In China's new stage of development, understanding
   the complex dynamics of the "people-land" relationship is crucial. The
   spatiotemporal development pattern, orientation difference
   characteristics, and spatial optimization layout of rural medical
   provide guidance for decision making regarding equity and quality
   improvement of rural public health services.

AB Oxidative stress is closely related to various diseases. Ozone can
   produce redox reactions through its unique response. As a source of the
   oxidative stress response, the strong oxidizing nature of ozone can
   cause severe damage to the body. On the other hand, low ozone
   concentrations can activate various mechanisms to combat oxidative
   stress and achieve therapeutic effects. Some animal experiments and
   clinical studies have revealed the potential medical value of ozone,
   indicating that ozone is not just a toxic gas. By reviewing the
   mechanism of ozone and its therapeutic value in treating central nervous
   system diseases (especially ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease) and
   the toxic effects of ozone, we find that ozone inhalation and a lack of
   antioxidants or excessive exposure lead to harmful impacts. However,
   with adequate antioxidants, ozone can transmit oxidative stress signals,
   reduce inflammation, reduce amyloid beta peptide levels, and improve
   tissue oxygenation. Similar mechanisms to those of possible new drugs
   for treating ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease indicate the
   potential of ozone. Nevertheless, limited research has restricted the
   application of ozone. More studies are needed to reveal the exact
   dose-effect relationship and healing effect of ozone.

AB Xenon gas has significant advantages over conventional general
   anesthetic agents but its use has been limited by the cost associated
   with its production. Xenon also has significant potential for medical
   use in the treatment of acquired brain injuries and for mental health
   disorders. As the demand for xenon gas from other industries increases,
   the costs associated with its medical use are only likely to increase.
   One solution to mitigate the significant cost of xenon use in research
   or medical care is the conservation of xenon gas. During delivery of
   xenon anesthesia, this can be achieved either by separating xenon from
   the other gases within the anesthetic circuit, conserving xenon and
   allowing other gases to be excluded from the circuit, or by selectively
   recapturing xenon utilized during the anesthetic episode at the
   conclusion of the case. Several technologies, including the
   pressurization and cooling of gas mixtures, the utilization of gas
   selective membranes and the utilization of gas selective adsorbents have
   been described in the literature for this purpose. These techniques are
   described in this narrative review along with important clinical context
   that informs how these technologies might be best applied. Whilst these
   technologies are discussed in the context of xenon general anesthesia,
   they could be applied in the delivery of xenon gas inhalation for other
   therapeutic purposes.

AB In today's era of modern healthcare, the intersection between medical
   practices and environmental responsibility has gained significant
   attention. One such area of focus is the practice of anesthesia, which
   plays a crucial role in various surgical procedures. Anesthetics such as
   nitrous oxide and volatile halogenated ethers (desflurane, isoflurane,
   sevoflurane) are examples of medical gases that are strong greenhouse
   gases that contribute to global warming. During medical procedures, most
   of these anesthetic agents are released into the atmosphere, which
   exacerbates their influence on the environment. Also anesthesia delivery
   systems have traditionally utilized high flow rates of gases, leading to
   not only excessive consumption but also a considerable environmental
   impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. However, the emergence of
   low-flow anesthesia (LFA) presents a promising solution for achieving
   emission reduction and cost savings, thereby aligning healthcare
   practices with sustainability goals. Understanding LFA involves the
   administration of anesthetic gases to patients at reduced flow rates
   compared to conventional high-flow methods. This practice requires
   precision in gas delivery, often incorporating advanced monitoring and
   control systems. By optimizing gas flow to match the patient's
   requirements, LFA minimizes wastage and excessive gas release into the
   environment, subsequently curbing the carbon footprint associated with
   healthcare operations. Decreasing volatile anesthetic delivery provides
   safe and effective strategies for anesthesia providers to decrease costs
   and reduce environmental pollution. Current literature support in favor
   of LFA represents an area of cost containment and an opportunity to
   lessen the environmental impact of anesthesia. This article will cover
   the concept of LFA, the distinctions between low flow and minimal flow,

AB Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent a major concern for human
   health worldwide. Emergencies in this field include wide repertories of
   studies dealing primarily with CVD prevention. In addition to dietary
   habits and lifestyles, medical knowledge is fully needed to improve
   public educational programs toward cardiovascular risk factors and to
   enrich the endowment of pharmaceutical options and therapies to address
   CVDs, particularly for ischemic damage due to an impairment in the
   endothelial-myocardial relationship. Because ozone is a stimulator of
   the endothelial nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide pathway, ozone
   therapy has been widely demonstrated to have the ability to counteract
   endothelial-cardiac disorders, providing a novel straightforward
   opportunity to reduce the impact of CVDs, including atrial fibrillation.
   In this review, we attempt to establish a state-of-the-art method for
   the use of ozone in CVD, suggesting that future remarks be addressed to
   provide fundamental insights into this issue. The purpose of this study
   was to highlight the role of ozone in the adjunctive medical treatment
   of cardiovascular pathologies such as acute myocardial infarction due to
   ischemic disorders.

AB Alzheimer's disease is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder with a
   complex and incompletely understood pathogenesis. Despite extensive
   research, a cure for Alzheimer's disease has not yet been found.
   Oxidative stress mediates excessive oxidative responses, and its
   involvement in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis as a primary or
   secondary pathological event is widely accepted. As a member of the
   selenium-containing antioxidant enzyme family, glutathione peroxidase 4
   reduces esterified phospholipid hydroperoxides to maintain cellular
   redox homeostasis. With the discovery of ferroptosis, the central role
   of glutathione peroxidase 4 in anti-lipid peroxidation in several
   diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, has received widespread
   attention. Increasing evidence suggests that glutathione peroxidase 4
   expression is inhibited in the Alzheimer's disease brain, resulting in
   oxidative stress, inflammation, ferroptosis, and apoptosis, which are
   closely associated with pathological damage in Alzheimer's disease.
   Several therapeutic approaches, such as small molecule drugs, natural
   plant products, and non-pharmacological treatments, ameliorate
   pathological damage and cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease by
   promoting glutathione peroxidase 4 expression and enhancing glutathione
   peroxidase 4 activity. Therefore, glutathione peroxidase 4 upregulation
   may be a promising strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
   This review provides an overview of the gene structure, biological
   functions, and regulatory mechanisms of glutathione peroxidase 4, a
   discussion on the important role of glutathione peroxidase 4 in
   pathological events closely related to Alzheimer's disease, and a
   summary of the advances in small-molecule drugs, natural plant products,
   and non-pharmacological therapies targeting glutathione peroxidase 4 for
   the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Most prior studies on this subject
   used animal models, and relevant clinical studies are lacking. Future
   clinical trials are required to validate the therapeutic effects of
   strategies targeting glutathione peroxidase 4 in the treatment of
   Alzheimer's disease.

AB Ischemic stroke is a cerebrovascular disease associated with high
   mortality and disability rates. Since the inflammation and immune
   response play a central role in driving ischemic damage, it becomes
   essential to modulate excessive inflammatory reactions to promote cell
   survival and facilitate tissue repair around the injury site. Various
   cell types are involved in the inflammatory response, including
   microglia, astrocytes, and neutrophils, each exhibiting distinct
   phenotypic profiles upon stimulation. They display either
   proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory states, a phenomenon known as 'cell
   polarization.' There are two cell polarization therapy strategies. The
   first involves inducing cells into a neuroprotective phenotype in vitro,
   then reintroducing them autologously. The second approach utilizes small
   molecular substances to directly affect cells in vivo. In this review,
   we elucidate the polarization dynamics of the three reactive cell
   populations (microglia, astrocytes, and neutrophils) in the context of
   ischemic stroke, and provide a comprehensive summary of the molecular
   mechanisms involved in their phenotypic switching. By unraveling the
   complexity of cell polarization, we hope to offer insights for future
   research on neuroinflammation and novel therapeutic strategies for
   ischemic stroke.

AB Neurodegenerative diseases cause great medical and economic burdens for
   both patients and society; however, the complex molecular mechanisms
   thereof are not yet well understood. With the development of
   high-coverage sequencing technology, researchers have started to notice
   that genomic repeat regions, previously neglected in search of disease
   culprits, are active contributors to multiple neurodegenerative
   diseases. In this review, we describe the association between repeat
   element variants and multiple degenerative diseases through genome-wide
   association studies and targeted sequencing. We discuss the
   identification of disease-relevant repeat element variants, further
   powered by the advancement of long-read sequencing technologies and
   their related tools, and summarize recent findings in the molecular
   mechanisms of repeat element variants in brain degeneration, such as
   those causing transcriptional silencing or RNA-mediated gain of toxic
   function. Furthermore, we describe how in silico predictions using
   innovative computational models, such as deep learning language models,
   could enhance and accelerate our understanding of the functional impact
   of repeat element variants. Finally, we discuss future directions to
   advance current findings for a better understanding of neurodegenerative
   diseases and the clinical applications of genomic repeat elements.

AB Spinal cord injury results in paralysis, sensory disturbances, sphincter
   dysfunction, and multiple systemic secondary conditions, most arising
   from autonomic dysregulation. All this produces profound negative
   psychosocial implications for affected people, their families, and their
   communities; the financial costs can be challenging for their families
   and health institutions. Treatments aimed at restoring the spinal cord
   after spinal cord injury, which have been tested in animal models or
   clinical trials, generally seek to counteract one or more of the
   secondary mechanisms of injury to limit the extent of the initial
   damage. Most published works on structural/functional restoration in
   acute and chronic spinal cord injury stages use a single type of
   treatment: a drug or trophic factor, transplant of a cell type, and
   implantation of a biomaterial. Despite the significant benefits reported
   in animal models, when translating these successful therapeutic
   strategies to humans, the result in clinical trials has been considered
   of little relevance because the improvement, when present, is usually
   insufficient. Until now, most studies designed to promote
   neuroprotection or regeneration at different stages after spinal cord
   injury have used single treatments. Considering the occurrence of
   various secondary mechanisms of injury in the acute and sub-acute phases
   of spinal cord injury, it is reasonable to speculate that more than one
   therapeutic agent could be required to promote structural and functional
   restoration of the damaged spinal cord. Treatments that combine several
   therapeutic agents, targeting different mechanisms of injury, which,
   when used as a single therapy, have shown some benefits, allow us to
   assume that they will have synergistic beneficial effects. Thus, this
   narrative review article aims to summarize current trends in the use of
   strategies that combine therapeutic agents administered simultaneously
   or sequentially, seeking structural and functional restoration of the
   injured spinal cord.

AB Sirtuin 2 is a member of the sirtuin family nicotinamide adenine
   dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases, known for its regulatory
   role in different processes, including inflammation. In this context,
   sirtuin 2 has been involved in the modulation of key inflammatory
   signaling pathways and transcription factors by deacetylating specific
   targets, such as nuclear factor kappa B and nucleotide-binding
   oligomerization domain-leucine-rich-repeat and pyrin domain-containing
   protein 3 (NLRP3). However, whether sirtuin 2-mediated pathways induce a
   pro- or an anti-inflammatory response remains controversial. Sirtuin 2
   has been implicated in promoting inflammation in conditions such as
   asthma and neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that its inhibition in
   these conditions could be a potential therapeutic strategy. Conversely,
   arthritis and type 2 diabetes mellitus studies suggest that sirtuin 2 is
   essential at the peripheral level and, thus, its inhibition in these
   pathologies would not be recommended. Overall, the precise role of
   sirtuin 2 in inflammation appears to be context-dependent, and further
   investigation is needed to determine the specific molecular mechanisms
   and downstream targets through which sirtuin 2 influences inflammatory
   processes in various tissues and pathological conditions. The present
   review explores the involvement of sirtuin 2 in the inflammation
   associated with different pathologies to elucidate whether its
   pharmacological modulation could serve as an effective strategy for
   treating this prevalent symptom across various diseases.

AB Alzheimer's disease, the primary cause of dementia, is characterized by
   neuropathologies, such as amyloid plaques, synaptic and neuronal
   degeneration, and neurofibrillary tangles. Although amyloid plaques are
   the primary characteristic of Alzheimer's disease in the central nervous
   system and peripheral organs, targeting amyloid-beta clearance in the
   central nervous system has shown limited clinical efficacy in
   Alzheimer's disease treatment. Metabolic abnormalities are commonly
   observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The liver is the primary
   peripheral organ involved in amyloid-beta metabolism, playing a crucial
   role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Notably, impaired
   cholesterol metabolism in the liver may exacerbate the development of
   Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we explore the underlying causes of
   Alzheimer's disease and elucidate the role of the liver in amyloid-beta
   clearance and cholesterol metabolism. Furthermore, we propose that
   restoring normal cholesterol metabolism in the liver could represent a
   promising therapeutic strategy for addressing Alzheimer's disease.

AB Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) signaling plays a pivotal role in
   dendritic growth and dendritic spine formation to promote learning and
   memory. The activity-dependent release of brain-derived neurotrophic
   factor at synapses binds to pre- or postsynaptic TrkB resulting in the
   strengthening of synapses, reflected by long-term potentiation.
   Postsynaptically, the association of postsynaptic density protein-95
   with TrkB enhances phospholipase C gamma-Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent
   protein kinase II and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mechanistic target
   of rapamycin signaling required for long-term potentiation. In this
   review, we discuss TrkB-postsynaptic density protein-95 coupling as a
   promising strategy to magnify brain-derived neurotrophic factor
   signaling towards the development of novel therapeutics for specific
   neurological disorders. A reduction of TrkB signaling has been observed
   in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and
   Huntington's disease, and enhancement of postsynaptic density protein-95
   association with TrkB signaling could mitigate the observed deficiency
   of neuronal connectivity in schizophrenia and depression. Treatment with
   brain-derived neurotrophic factor is problematic, due to poor
   pharmacokinetics, low brain penetration, and side effects resulting from
   activation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor or the truncated TrkB.T1
   isoform. Although TrkB agonists and antibodies that activate TrkB are
   being intensively investigated, they cannot distinguish the multiple
   human TrkB splicing isoforms or cell type-specific functions. Targeting
   TrkB-postsynaptic density protein-95 coupling provides an alternative
   approach to specifically boost TrkB signaling at localized synaptic
   sites versus global stimulation that risks many adverse side effects.

AB Developing effective and long-term treatment strategies for rare and
   complex neurodegenerative diseases is challenging. One of the major
   roadblocks is the extensive heterogeneity among patients. This hinders
   understanding the underlying disease-causing mechanisms and building
   solutions that have implications for a broad spectrum of patients. One
   potential solution is to develop personalized medicine approaches based
   on strategies that target the most prevalent cellular events that are
   perturbed in patients. Especially in patients with a known genetic
   mutation, it may be possible to understand how these mutations
   contribute to problems that lead to neurodegeneration. Protein-protein
   interaction analyses offer great advantages for revealing how proteins
   interact, which cellular events are primarily involved in these
   interactions, and how they become affected when key genes are mutated in
   patients. This line of investigation also suggests novel druggable
   targets for patients with different mutations. Here, we focus on alsin
   and spastin, two proteins that are identified as "causative" for
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and hereditary spastic paraplegia,
   respectively, when mutated. Our review analyzes the protein interactome
   for alsin and spastin, the canonical pathways that are primarily
   important for each protein domain, as well as compounds that are either
   Food and Drug Administration-approved or are in active clinical trials
   concerning the affected cellular pathways. This line of research begins
   to pave the way for personalized medicine approaches that are
   desperately needed for rare neurodegenerative diseases that are complex

AB The role of copper element has been an increasingly relevant topic in
   recent years in the fields of human and animal health, for both the
   study of new drugs and innovative food and feed supplements. This metal
   plays an important role in the central nervous system, where it is
   associated with glutamatergic signaling, and it is widely involved in
   inflammatory processes. Thus, diseases involving copper (II)
   dyshomeostasis often have neurological symptoms, as exemplified by
   Alzheimer's and other diseases (such as Parkinson's and Wilson's
   diseases). Moreover, imbalanced copper ion concentrations have also been
   associated with diabetes and certain types of cancer, including glioma.
   In this paper, we propose a comprehensive overview of recent results
   that show the importance of these metal ions in several pathologies,
   mainly Alzheimer's disease, through the lens of the development and use
   of copper chelators as research compounds and potential therapeutics if
   included in multi-target hybrid drugs. Seeing how copper homeostasis is
   important for the well-being of animals as well as humans, we shortly
   describe the state of the art regarding the effects of copper and its
   chelators in agriculture, livestock rearing, and aquaculture, as
   ingredients for the formulation of feed supplements as well as to
   prevent the effects of pollution on animal productions.

   multifaceted roles of meningeal lymphatic vessels within the context of
   the central nervous system immune network, highlighting recent
   discoveries on the immunological niche provided by meningeal lymphatic
   vessels. Furthermore, we delve into the mechanisms of crosstalk between
   meningeal lymphatic vessels and immune cells in the central nervous
   system under both homeostatic conditions and neurodegenerative diseases,
   discussing how these interactions shape the pathological outcomes.
   Regulation of meningeal lymphatic vessel function and structure can
   influence lymphatic drainage, cerebrospinal fluid-borne immune
   modulators, and immune cell populations in aging and neurodegenerative
   disorders, thereby playing a key role in shaping meningeal and brain
   parenchyma immunity.

AB Mononuclear macrophage infiltration in the central nervous system is a
   prominent feature of neuroinflammation. Recent studies on the
   pathogenesis and progression of multiple sclerosis have highlighted the
   multiple roles of mononuclear macrophages in the neuroinflammatory
   process. Monocytes play a significant role in neuroinflammation, and
   managing neuroinflammation by manipulating peripheral monocytes stands
   out as an effective strategy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis,
   leading to improved patient outcomes. This review outlines the steps
   involved in the entry of myeloid monocytes into the central nervous
   system that are targets for effective intervention: the activation of
   bone marrow hematopoiesis, migration of monocytes in the blood, and
   penetration of the blood-brain barrier by monocytes. Finally, we
   summarize the different monocyte subpopulations and their effects on the
   central nervous system based on phenotypic differences. As activated
   microglia resemble monocyte-derived macrophages, it is important to
   accurately identify the role of monocyte-derived macrophages in disease.
   Depending on the roles played by monocyte-derived macrophages at
   different stages of the disease, several of these processes can be
   interrupted to limit neuroinflammation and improve patient prognosis.
   Here, we discuss possible strategies to target monocytes in neurological
   diseases, focusing on three key aspects of monocyte infiltration into
   the central nervous system, to provide new ideas for the treatment of
   neurodegenerative diseases.

AB Specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators including maresin 1 mediate
   resolution but the levels of these are reduced in Alzheimer's disease
   brain, suggesting that they constitute a novel target for the treatment
   of Alzheimer's disease to prevent/stop inflammation and combat disease
   pathology. Therefore, it is important to clarify whether they counteract
   the expression of genes and proteins induced by amyloid-beta. With this
   objective, we analyzed the relevance of human monocyte-derived microglia
   for in vitro modeling of neuroinflammation and its resolution in the
   context of Alzheimer's disease and investigated the pro-resolving
   bioactivity of maresin 1 on amyloid-beta 42-induced Alzheimer's
   disease-like inflammation. Analysis of RNA-sequencing data and secreted
   proteins in supernatants from the monocyte-derived microglia showed that
   the monocyte-derived microglia resembled Alzheimer's disease-like
   neuroinflammation in human brain microglia after incubation with
   amyloid-beta 42. Maresin 1 restored homeostasis by down-regulating
   inflammatory pathway related gene expression induced by amyloid-beta 42
   in monocyte-derived microglia, protection of maresin 1 against the
   effects of amyloid-beta 42 is mediated by a re-balancing of inflammatory
   transcriptional networks in which modulation of gene transcription in
   the nuclear factor-kappa B pathway plays a major part. We pinpointed
   molecular targets that are associated with both neuroinflammation in
   Alzheimer's disease and therapeutic targets by maresin 1. In conclusion,
   monocyte-derived microglia represent a relevant in vitro microglial
   model for studies on Alzheimer's disease-like inflammation and drug
   response for individual patients. Maresin 1 ameliorates amyloid-beta
   42-induced changes in several genes of importance in Alzheimer's
   disease, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for
   Alzheimer's disease.

AB METFORMIN is one of the medications used to treat diabetes most
   frequently nowadays, which is also used in non -diabetic patients to
   treat fatty liver, weight reduction, infertility, polycystic ovarian
   syndrome, prevention of pregnancy complications, prevention of diabetes
   and obesity. However, its use may have several serious adverse effects
   such as hepatic injury, renal toxicity and spleen damage. This study was
   designed to assess the potential pathogenic impact of metformin on the
   liver, kidneys and spleen in normoglycemic rats. Two equal groups of
   twelve adult female rats were randomly selected. First group was
   intraperitoneally injected with metformin (200 mg/kg) as a single dose
   for three days and the second group was used as a control received an
   intraperitoneal injection of the similar -volume of physiological
   saline. The animal weight, organs weight, creatinine, lactate and
   vitamin B 12 were measured. Histopathological changes in the liver,
   kidneys and spleen were also studied. The blood parameters levels didn't
   alter with metformin use. The metformin treated group showed structural
   damage of varying degrees in all three organs; liver, kidney and spleen.
   Metformin like any medication may be helpful in treating certain medical
   issues. However, the results of the current study confirms that the
   metformin use can cause hepatic injury, renal toxicity and moderate
   damage to the spleen tissues, which may contribute to the clinical
   effects of the drug; physicians and patients alike need to be aware of
   these possible side effects.

AB Herbal therapy is a type of alternative or complementary medicine that
   uses natural ingredients to alleviate health issues including mental
   illness. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative
   condition marked by a slow loss of memory coupled with shrinkage of
   brain tissue, localized loss of neurons, primarily in the hippocampus
   and basal forebrain, and decreased levels of the central cholinergic
   neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Bacopa monnieri is also known as brahmi
   which is very well known for memory enhancer and Piper nigrum is work as
   bioavailability enhancer which will reduce the dose frequency and
   increase effectiveness on other drugs. So, this study's goal was to look
   at the physicochemical parameters, phytochemical characteristics, and
   synergistic memory enhancing effect of B. monnieri with P. nigrum a
   natural bioenhancer on mice with scopolamine-induced learning and memory
   deficits. Six group of six animal were treated respectively, once daily
   with ethanolic extract of B. monnieri (EEBM) (200 mg/kg), ethanolic
   extract of P. nigrum (EEPN) 200 mg/kg, Combination of EEBM (100 mg/kg)
   with EEPN (100 mg/kg), donepezil 1 mg/kg via oral dosing and were given
   intraperitoneal (ip) injection of scopolamine 1 mg/kg daily to induce
   cognitive deficits. The tests for locomotor activity, stair climbing,
   and pole climbing were utilised to evaluate the learning and memory
   components. Additionally examined were dopamine, serotonin (5-HT) and
   other physiological elements. The results showed combination of Brahmi
   and black pepper shows pole climbing, actophotometer activity, staircase
   activity that showed better therapeutic advantages for improving mice's
   antiamnesic activity as compared to single extract of Brahmi. In
   response, the treated groups with combined extract emitted noticeably
   more dopamine and serotonin. When compared to illness control, the
   extract's ability to improve memory was highly significant (P< 0.001).
   These findings indicate that the combination of Brahmi and black pepper
   improved memory and hence could serve as a viable therapeutic target for
   the treatment of neurodegenerative illnesses.

AB For quality control improvement of medicine and food homology (MFH)
   health food, the concept of functional quality control and rapid
   screening strategy of functional compounds were proposed based on the
   dual identity characteristics. Taking Wuweisanqi Capsule as the research
   object, firstly, a modified method "syndrome correlation-network
   analysis" based on network pharmacology was used for analysis. Functions
   related targets were collected from common medical databases, while the
   clustering algorithm was used to extract the information of clinical
   records related to daily health care from traditional Chinese medicine
   (TCM) database to obtain the targets. The bioactive compounds and
   related targets were retrieved from the TCM Systems Pharmacology
   Database and Analysis Platform around the five materials included in
   formula. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and pathway
   enrichment analysis were performed on the intersection targets.
   According to the constructed formula material-compound-target-pathway
   network, the potential functional compounds were preliminarily
   identified. Secondly, key targets and compounds were analyzed by
   molecular docking to further screen functional compounds. Finally,
   combined with references, the screening and establishing determination
   methods of functional compounds containing total saponins, astragaloside
   IV, puerarin and schisandrin were finished. The rapid screening strategy
   adequately utilizes the advantage of TCM background for MFH health food
   and the effective extracting ability of massive data by the algorithm.
   It links three aspects of health food functions, formula materials and
   functional compounds, providing an efficient solution for the
   realization of function-formula-component integrated functional quality
   control, which has great application potential in health food industry.

AB Environmental factors play a role in the development and severity of
   neuropsychiatric disorders. Externalizing disorders are characterized by
   disruptive, impulsive, and often aggressive behaviors, including
   difficulties with self-control, rule-breaking, and a tendency to act out
   in ways that may harm oneself or others. Externalizing disorders
   frequently co-occur with internalizing disorders, such as anxiety.
   Individuals experiencing both externalizing/internalizing disorders are
   often among the most likely to seek healthcare services, as this
   cooccurrence is associated with more severe symptomatology and greater
   functional impairment. Here, we investigated the impact of environmental
   enrichment (EE) on adgrl3.1, a gene associated with impulsivity and
   attention deficits in zebrafish (Danio rerio). This gene encodes a
   receptor involved in cell adhesion and signaling and has been linked to
   susceptibility to externalizing disorders. Zebrafish were reared in
   either standard or enriched environments (from 15 days-post
   fertilization), and attention, impulsivity, and anxiety-related
   phenotypes were assessed at adult stages (4 months-post fertilization)
   using the open field test and a 5-choice serial reaction time task. EE
   mitigated anxiety-related behaviors in adgrl3.1 knockouts, normalizing
   locomotor patterns and decreasing thigmotaxis. Although attention
   deficits were reduced in adgrl3.1-/- fish reared in EE, impulsive
   behaviors were not. Together, these findings suggest that while
   environmental enrichment (EE) mitigates externalizing and internalizing
   symptoms in adgrl3.1 mutants, impulsivity remains less responsive to EE
   used in this study, indicating its distinct resistance to modulation.

AB Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is widely used in medical devices because of
   its exceptional properties. However, challenges, such as biofouling and
   bacterial infections, arise from their hydrophobic nature, especially in
   devices intended for the urinary tract. To address these issues, this
   study pioneered a surface modification strategy aimed at enriching PDMS
   with both hydrophilicity and antifouling attributes, making it ideal for
   urinary tract device applications. We introduced a novel dual-layer
   coating process, initially grafting a hydrogel-like poly(acrylic acid)
   (PAA) layer onto PDMS through benzophenone-mediated photoinitiated
   polymerization to enhance surface hydrophilicity. Subsequently,
   polyethyleneimine (PEI) was covalently bonded to the PAA layer, ensuring
   the formation of a stable antifouling surface that prevented bacterial
   adhesion and calcium deposition. This method guarantees a robust coating
   that performs consistently across various environmental conditions,
   including the fluctuating pH levels typical of the urinary tract.
   Comprehensive surface characterization validated the substantial
   improvements in hydrophilicity along with significant reductions in
   bacterial adhesion and calcium deposition. The innovative PAA/PEI
   dual-layer coating demonstrated marked superiority over conventional
   uncoated and single-layer-coated PDMS samples, offering a promising
   solution for enhancing the safety and efficacy of PDMS-based urinary
   tract devices. The implications of this study extend beyond immediate
   applications and provide valuable insights into the domains of
   biomaterials and medical device engineering.

TI Lower DTI-ALPS index in patients with major depressive disorder:
   Correlation with fatigue

AB Background and purpose: Diffusion tensor imaging along perivascular
   spaces (DTI-ALPS) is an index that may provide insights into
   intracranial waste clearance processes. Glymphatic system dysfunction
   has been suggested to play a role in the development of major depressive
   disorder (MDD). Additionally, fatigue-a common precursor of MDD-is also
   closely connected to the waste clearance function of the central nervous
   system (CNS), further underscoring the significance of efficient waste
   removal in MDD. However, evidence linking altered DTI-ALPS index to MDD
   remains limited. This study aims to investigate the changes in the
   DTI-ALPS index in patients with MDD and explore the potential interplay
   between DTI-ALPS index alterations, fatigue, and the presence of MDD.
   Material and methods: A total of 46 patients with MDD and 55 healthy
   controls (HC) were included in the study. All participants underwent
   diffusion tensor imaging using the same 3-T MRI (3-Tesla Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging) scanner. The DTI-ALPS index was assessed, and the
   Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS) was used to evaluate fatigue levels in both
   groups, and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) was
   used to evaluate the severity of depression in the patients. We compared
   the DTI-ALPS index and clinical characteristics between the MDD and HC
   group, and explored the relationship among the DTI-ALPS index, CFS
   scores, and the presence of MDD through mediation analysis. Results: The
   DTI-ALPS index in the right hemisphere (DTI-ALPS-R) is significantly
   lower in patients with MDD (t = 2.41, P = 0.02). The MDD patients
   exhibited significantly higher scores on the CFS scales compared with
   HCs (t = 13.12, P <.001). Mediation analysis showed that the CFS score
   plays a significant mediating role between DTI-ALPS-R and the presence
   of MDD, acting as a full mediator (indirect effect beta = -0.230, 95 %
   CI: [-0.388, -0.059]). Conclusion: Our study found that patients with
   MDD have a reduced DTI-ALPS index. This reduction appears to contribute
   to the development of MDD by facilitating the accumulation of fatigue
   symptoms. These findings may provide a new perspective on the
   pathogenesis of MDD, suggest a potential new biomarker for MDD, and
   offer new insights for its treatment.

AB Reduced graphene oxide@Al2O3-CuO-TiO2 (ACT) based nanocomposites (NCs)
   were combined by regulated hydrothermal technique to create novel
   rGO@metal oxides-based NCs. The resultant NCs showed excellent
   photocatalytic, antibacterial, anticorrosive, and magnetic
   characteristics. The use of FTIR, TEM, UV-visible, Xray diffraction, and
   SEM aids the structural examination of NCs. The synergistic pairing of
   ACT NPs with rGO exhibits enhanced photocatalytic, magnetic,
   anticorrosive, and antibacterial characteristics. The NCs exhibited
   paramagnetic character (chi = 0.140) and increased induced current with
   applied magnetic field. The photocatalytic properties of NCs were
   examined for decomposing methylene blue dye in UV and Sunlight. 94.7 %
   and 70.5 % dye degradation was observed under UV and Sunlight after 335
   and 110 min. of exposure, respectively. The Zone of Inhibition was
   examined against S. aureus (Gram-positive) and E. coli (Gram-negative)
   bacteria and was found comparable with standard antibiotics (Ampicillin)
   against S. aureus bacterial strain. The NCs show 99 % corrosion
   inhibition efficiency at a low concentration (10 ppm). The potential
   applications of ACT@rGO NCs in environmental rehabilitation, the medical
   field, anticorrosive coatings, and impure water purification, contribute
   toward the development of advanced nanomaterials-based devices.

AB Nanomaterials (NMs) have emerged as promising tools for disease
   diagnosis and therapy due to their unique physicochemical properties. To
   maximize the effectiveness and design of NMs-based medical applications,
   it is essential to comprehend the complex mechanisms of cellular uptake,
   subcellular localization, and cellular retention. This review
   illuminates the various pathways that NMs take to get from the
   extracellular environment to certain intracellular compartments by
   investigating the various mechanisms that underlie their interaction
   with cells. The cellular uptake of NMs involves complex interactions
   with cell membranes, encompassing endocytosis, phagocytosis, and other
   active transport mechanisms. Unique uptake patterns across cell types
   highlight the necessity for customized NMs designs. After
   internalization, NMs move through a variety of intracellular routes that
   affect where they are located subcellularly. Understanding these
   pathways is pivotal for enhancing the targeted delivery of therapeutic
   agents and imaging probes. Furthermore, the cellular retention of NMs
   plays a critical role in sustained therapeutic efficacy and long-term
   imaging capabilities. Factors influencing cellular retention include
   nanoparticle size, surface chemistry, and the cellular microenvironment.
   Strategies for prolonging cellular retention are discussed, including
   surface modifications and encapsulation techniques. In conclusion, a
   comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms governing cellular uptake,
   subcellular localization, and cellular retention of NMs is essential for
   advancing their application in disease diagnosis and therapy. This
   review provides insights into the intricate interplay between NMs and
   biological systems, offering a foundation for the rational design of
   next-generation nanomedicines.

AB There has been a lot of study and advancement in the area of carbon
   allotropes in the last several decades, driven by the exceptional and
   diverse physical and chemical characteristics of carbon nanomaterials.
   For example, nanostructured forms such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs),
   graphene, and carbon quantum dots have the potential to revolutionize
   various industries (Roston 2010 The Carbon Age: How Life's Core Element
   Has Become Civilization's Greatest Threat; In and Noy 2014
   Nanotechnology's Wonder Material: Synthesis of Carbon Nanotubes; Peng et
   al 2014 Nanotechnol. Sci. Appl. 7 1-29). The global scientific community
   continues to research in the field of creating new materials,
   particularly low-dimensional carbon allotropes such as CNTs and carbyne.
   Carbyne is a one-dimensional carbon allotrope with a large surface area,
   chemical reactivity, and gas molecule adsorption potential that makes it
   extremely sensitive to gases and electronic nose (E-nose) applications
   due to its linear sp-hybridized atomic chain structure. The primary
   objective of this work is to increase the sensitivity, selectivity, and
   overall efficiency of E-nose systems using a synergistic combination of
   carbyne-based sensing components with cutting-edge machine learning (ML)
   techniques. The exceptional electronic properties of carbyne, such as
   its high electron mobility and adjustable bandgap, enable rapid and
   specific adsorption of various gas molecules. Additionally, its
   significant surface area-to-volume ratio enhances the detection of trace
   concentrations. Our suggested advanced hybrid system utilises support
   vector machines and convolutional neural networks as sophisticated ML
   approaches to analyse data provided by carbyne sensors. These algorithms
   enhance the precision and durability of gas detection by effectively
   recognising intricate patterns and correlations in the sensor data.
   Empirical evidence suggests that E-nose systems based on carbyne have
   superior performance in terms of reaction time, sensitivity, and
   specificity compared to conventional materials. This research emphasises
   the revolutionary potential of carbyne in the advancement of
   next-generation gas sensing systems, which has significant implications
   for applications in environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and
   industrial process control.

AB In medical device disinfection, removing bacteria and biofilms is
   challenging due to the poor penetration of detergents into the biofilm
   matrix. This is specifically true for endoscopes, which cannot be fully
   sterilized. This paper presents a new technique for decontaminating and
   removing P. aeruginosa biofilm from endoscope tubing using cold
   atmospheric plasma (CAP). The CAP is produced everywhere inside a
   contaminated tube under sustained Ar/H2O flow. The tube arrangement
   mimics the working channel environment of an endoscope, which is
   particularly difficult to sterilize. The discharge's chemical activity
   was optimized by increasing the voltage without increasing the total
   power, which enhanced the production of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and
   hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The disinfection treatment was tested on 24 h
   grown biofilm using the crystal violet assay for biofilm removal and the
   regrowth assay for bacterial decontamination. The treatments
   demonstrated effective decontamination capabilities at all treatment
   times with no bacterial regrowth. Etching of the biofilm sample by OH
   radicals was observed. After 30 min of treatment, only 18 +/- 4% of
   biofilm remained on the surface, indicating near-complete biofilm
   removal and total absence of bacterial regrowth. This preliminary study
   demonstrates the effectiveness of using the direct contact of an Ar/H2O
   plasma to decontaminate and remove biofilm from complex shapes, such as
   flexible polytetraethylene tubes. It has the potential to enhance and
   shorten the disinfection of medical equipment, such as endoscopes.

AB In the central nervous system, oligodendrocytes wrap around neuronal
   axons to form myelin, an insulating layer or sheath that allows for the
   efficient conductance of action potentials. In addition to structural
   insulation, myelin provides encased axons with nutrient, metabolic and
   defensive support. Demyelination, or myelin loss, can therefore cause
   axonal dysfunction, leading to neurological impairment and disease. In
   Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive white matter demyelination is
   acknowledged as one of the earliest pathologies preceding symptom onset.
   Unfortunately, current pharmacotherapy for slowing demyelination or
   promoting remyelination in AD is nonexistent. Exercise is recognized for
   its wide-ranging benefits to human health, including improved mental
   health and the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases. Mounting
   evidence suggests the contribution of physical activity in delaying the
   progression of dementia in elderly populations. Recent mechanistic
   studies have shown that exercise facilitates myelination in the brain
   through the vitalization of intrinsic pro-myelination cues, such as
   increased neurotrophic factors and electrical activity. In this review,
   we summarize and discuss the potential of physical exercise on
   counteracting aging-associated white matter demyelination, which causes
   cognitive decline in AD. We highlight the need of further basic and
   clinical research investigations on this topic to establish novel
   approaches for healthy and improved brain aging.

   to their unique magnetic and structural properties. In this study, we
   present a green synthesis approach utilizing Annona muricata extract to
   prepare nickel ferrite ( NiFe 2 O 4 ) nanoparticles, emphasizing an
   eco-friendly solution to overcome the limitations of conventional
   chemical synthesis methods. Using a sol-gel auto-combustion technique,
   we synthesized cerium-doped nickel ferrite nanoparticles and
   characterized them thoroughly to evaluate their structural, optical,
   magnetic, and anti-cancer properties. The characterization results
   showed that the nanoparticles formed a cubic spinel structure with
   reduced crystallite sizes and altered lattice parameters. The
   synthesized nanoparticles displayed agglomerated spherical morphology
   with high phase purity. The cerium doping caused changes in binding
   energies, which enhanced the magnetic properties, including increased
   saturation magnetization and reduced coercivity. Additionally, the
   anti-cancer efficacy of the nanoparticles was confirmed through
   3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay
   results, showing dose-dependent cytotoxicity against Michigan Cancer
   Foundation-7 (MCF-7) breast cancer cells. These findings suggest
   promising applications in targeted drug delivery and cancer therapy,

AB The various diseases outbreaks and infections caused by pathogens have
   brought great losses to the aquaculture industry of grass carp.
   Probiotics are one of the important ways in water quality management and
   inhibition of bacterial diseases. Thus, more and more attention is being
   paid to potential indigenous probiotics. The present study isolated a
   probiotic strain of Enterococcus faecium (E. faecium) L6 from the
   intestinal content of healthy grass carp, and evaluated the probiotic
   effect in vitro. Subsequently, a feeding trial of 56 days was performed
   to evaluate the effect of E. faecium (1 x 10(8) CFU/g) on growth
   performance in juvenile grass carp and infection resistance to Aeromonas
   hydrophila (A. hydrophila). Our data showed that diet supplementation
   with E. faecium L6 for 56 days significantly increased final body weight
   (FBW), weight gain rate (WGR), specific growth rate (SGR) of juvenile
   grass carp and decreased feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to that of
   basal diet group without probiotic supplemented (P < 0.05). The
   expression of inflammatory factors TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1 beta in the
   liver, spleen and kidney showed an early increase and later decrease,
   and ultimately restored a nearly normal level on 56 days of feeding, and
   tight junction proteins genes zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2), zonula
   occludens-3 (ZO-3), occludin and claudin were significantly up-regulated
   from 21 days after feeding E. faecium L6 supplementary diet (P < 0.05).
   Following a challenge by A. hydrophila infection, there was an increase
   of 26.67 % in the survival rate of diet supplementation of E. faecium L6
   group, and the bacterial load in the liver, spleen and kidney was
   significantly reduced after E. faecium L6 feeding (P < 0.01).
   High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene revealed that E. faecium L6
   feeding increased the relative abundance of the phylum Fusobacteriota
   and Bacteroidota, and Cetobacterium and Bacteroides at genus level in
   the intestinal microbiota composition, as well as improved the
   functional pathways related to metabolism of purine, biotin, cysteine,
   methionine, D-Glutamine and D-glutamate, and biosynthesis of
   aminoacyl-tRNA and lipopolysaccharide. Analysis of microbial community-
   level phenotypes revealed that aerobic, contains mobile elements,
   facultatively anaerobic, biofilm-forming, Gram-negative,
   potential-pathogenicity and stress-tolerance phenotypes were remarkably
   decreased in E. faecium L6 supplemented diet group, while anaerobic and
   Gram-positive phenotypes were highly increased. Collectively, E. faecium
   strain L6 as a prospective probiotic can be used in the healthy breeding
   of grass carp production.

AB Transformation of epithelial to mesenchymal (EMT) is an important event
   in the process of tumor initiation, invasion and metastasis. Circulating
   tumor cells (CTCs) are one kind of important markers in the field of
   liquid tumor biopsy, whose number and phenotype represent the occurrence
   and progression of tumors. Therefore, it is our interest to investigate
   the epithelial mesenchymal transition process occurring on the surface
   of CTCs. Herein in this work, two proteins of E-cadherin (E-cad) and
   N-cadherin (N-cad) were selected as representative proteins of EMT
   process. To achieve simultaneous analysis of E-cad and N-cad on the
   surface of rare CTCs, we designed a duplex and portable immunosensor
   using AuNPs and AgNPs as nanolabels to amplify the immunoreaction
   signals. The dual channel immunosensor not only exhibited good
   electrochemical responses for recombinant E-cad and N-cad as low as 0.1
   ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively, but also showed good linear
   correlations with different numbers of phenotypic CTCs (10-500 cells/10
   mu L). The above strategy was further employed to inspect the occurrence
   of EMT on CTCs surface, which displayed a high consistence with other
   molecular biological characterizations. Finally, this immunoassay was
   successfully applied to inspect the correlations of numbers, phenotype
   of CTCs, as well as E-cad and N-cad expressions on these CTCs in bloods
   of NSCLC patients with disease stage.

AB Background: There is growing interest in exploring the relationship
   between frailty and common psychiatric disorders. However, there have
   been limited reports on the genetic variation level of frailty with
   psychiatric disorders. Method: We conducted large-scale Two-sample
   Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to examine whether there is an
   association between frailty and common psychiatric disorders (bipolar
   disorder [BD], major depressive disorder [MDD], schizophrenia, and
   suicide or other Intentional self-harm). We employed multiple MR
   approaches to conduct the MR analysis, including MR-Egger, weighted
   median, and random-effect inverse variance weighted (IVW). The IVW
   method served as the primary analysis. Heterogeneity testing and
   sensitivity analysis were also conducted in the MR study. Results: The
   MR results denoted that frailty was associated with an increased risk of
   BD (odds ratio (OR) =1.60, P IVW = 0.017), MDD (OR = 2.04, P IVW <
   0.001), schizophrenia (OR = 1.91, P IVW = 0.005), and suicide or other
   Intentional self-harm (OR = 1.77, P IVW < 0.001). For reverse analysis,
   we observed no significant association between psychiatric disorders and
   the risk of frailty. These results remained consistent across
   sensitivity assessments. Conclusions: Our research indicates a potential
   unidirectional causal relationship, suggesting that frailty may serve as
   a risk factor for certain common psychiatric disorders. These findings
   carry important for implications for psychiatric disorders and frailty
   patient care.

   may contribute to worse outcomes. While most studies focus on depression
   as a primary precursor, both anxiety and attention deficit disorders are
   also frequent initial diagnoses. In the current study, we utilized a
   large, diverse electronic health record (EHR) dataset to quantify the
   rates and correlates of conversion to BD from these major precursor
   diagnoses. Methods: Our study analyzed a comprehensive ten-year EHR
   dataset from Johns Hopkins Medicine, a diverse urban medical center, to
   assess and compare the rates and correlates of conversion to BD from
   Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), anxiety disorders, and ADHD. Risk
   factors for transition were assessed as time-varying variables in
   proportional hazards models. Results: Of the 21,341 patients initially
   included, 1232 later transitioned to a diagnosis of BD.
   Adjusted-one-year conversion rates for patients with MDD, anxiety
   disorders, and ADHD were 4.2 %, 3.4 %, and 4.0 %, respectively, with
   ten-year rates at 11.4 %, 9.4 %, and 10.9 %, respectively. Age (19-29
   years), treatment setting (emergency and inpatient), and psychotropic
   medications were associated with conversion to BD across all precursor
   diagnoses. Severe and psychotic forms of MDD were among the strongest
   risk factors for transitioning to BD. Although risk factors for
   convertion were similar, transition rates were lower in children,
   particularly in indivudals with ADHD, who showed a higher rate of BD
   conversion in adults. Conclusions: The highest risk of transitioning to
   BD was observed in patients initially diagnosed with MDD, though
   significant risk was also noted in those with initial diagnoses of
   anxiety disorders and adult ADHD.

AB Background: Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) is a cyclical mood
   disorder whereby symptoms are triggered by normal hormonal changes
   during the menstrual cycle. A better understanding of psychological
   changes that occur with PMDD can inform non-pharmacological and
   non-invasive treatment interventions. Methods: A systematic review was
   conducted of quantitative studies that measured any aspect of cognition
   or behaviour at a minimum of two time points in the menstrual cycle in
   those with and without PMDD. A narrative synthesis is reported. Results:
   94 outcome measures were extracted from 21 papers and a total
   participant sample of 1222. Risk of bias was noted in relation to lack
   of power analysis and inappropriate statistical methods. Cognitive
   performance was most often tested but evidence of change with PMDD was
   limited and inconsistent. Findings of studies exploring cognitive
   processes and content suggest that a negative attentional bias is
   central to the psychological experience of PMDD. Limitations: A
   quantitative synthesis could not be conducted due to limited reporting
   of key data. Conclusions: Cognitive process, content, and behaviour are
   likely to be more informative in understanding PMDD than absolute
   cognitive abilities. Future studies should aim to investigate such in
   real-time and within the context of daily living.

AB Background: Alcohol harms changed significantly during COVID-19, but did
   not affect the population equally. Vulnerable groups including people
   with pre-existing mental health or suicidal behaviors may be at greater
   risk of alcohol-related harms, yet limited public health data are able
   to assess these. Methods: The present study utilised a novel, statewide
   surveillance system to examine ambulance attendances for alcohol
   intoxication over a four-year period prior to, and during the strictest
   lockdowns in Victoria, Australia. Results: While there was an overall
   reduction in alcohol-related attendances during lockdown (n = 15,064)
   compared to the 2018-19 period (n = 16,989), alcohol- intoxication
   attendances involving mental health symptoms increased by 40 % in
   Melbourne (IRR: 1.40 [1.30-1.51], p < 0.001), and by 25 % in regional
   Victoria (IRR: 1.25 [1.07-1.44], p = 0.005).There was also a 7 %
   increase in alcohol-intoxication attendances with co- morbid suicidal
   behaviors in Melbourne (IRR: 1.07 95%CI [1.02-1.13], p = 0.006), and a
   21 % increase in regional Victoria (IRR: 1.21 [1.08-1.35], p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that extra services and supports for
   individuals with co-morbid alcohol- related harms are required to ensure
   their clinical care needs are being met.

AB Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's
   disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral
   sclerosis (ALS) are increasingly linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and
   neuroinflammation. Central to this link are mitochondrial
   damage-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs), including mitochondrial
   DNA, ATP, and reactive oxygen species, released during mitochondrial
   stress or damage. These mtDAMPs activate inflammatory pathways, such as
   the NLRP3 inflammasome and cGAS-STING, contributing to the progression
   of neurodegenerative diseases. This review delves into the mechanisms by
   which mtDAMPs drive neuroinflammation and discusses potential
   therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways to mitigate
   neurodegeneration. Additionally, it explores the cross-talk between
   mitochondria and the immune system, highlighting the complex interplay
   that exacerbates neuronal damage. Understanding the role of mtDAMPs
   could pave the way for novel treatments aimed at modulating
   neuroinflammation and slowing disease progression, ultimately improving
   patient outcome.

AB Changes in the neurotransmitters are indications for several diseases.
   Several sensors were reported for monitoring dopamine (DA), but the
   simple and accurate DA detection in biological samples still faces many
   challenges. The research proposal aims to develop an optical sensor for
   detecting neurotransmitters based on luminescence emission spectra in
   different biological samples. Carbon dots (CDs) were fabricated based on
   a green synthesis route. Then the prepared CDs were decorated with
   varying concentrations of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs). The synthesis
   process was optimized, and the obtained CDs/Au NPs nanocomposites were
   applied as neurotransmitters' optical nanosensors. The optical
   nanosensor approach provides easy and sensitive multiplex analysis. A
   wide range of neurotransmitters was monitored. The developed sensor's
   sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility were investigated. Au NPs
   act as CDs' stabilizers, enhancing the emission effect, and scaffolds
   for binding DA with CDs' surface. DA moieties bind to CDs through the
   interaction between the DA-NH2 groups and Au NPS. Due to electron
   transfer, the bonding of DA molecules leads to fluorescence quenching of
   AuNPs/CDs. The Au-CDs-based DA fluorescence showed high sensitivity with
   a detection limit, and limit quantification of 2.04 nM and 6.18 nM,
   respectively. Furthermore, the selectivity of the sensor was
   investigated in the presence of glucose, uric acid (UA), and ascorbic
   acid (AA), which showed no interference effect at 10 times higher
   concentrations. Moreover, the proposed sensor has been successfully
   utilized for DA detection in human serum samples with a high recovery
   efficiency between 98.83 % and 103.5 %.

AB Introduction: Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is an independent risk
   factor for cardiovascular diseases due to endothelial dysfunction and
   atherosclerosis development. The aim of this study was to determine
   whether the levothyroxine therapy could impact the concentrations of
   endothelial dysfunction blood markers, namely endothelin-1 (ET-1),
   asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and endocan, in patients with a mild
   form of SCH (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) ≤ 10 mIU/L).
   Materials and methods: In this case-control prospective study, SCH
   patients and healthy controls were recruited during their regular health
   examinations. Medical specialists prescribed levothyroxine to SCH
   patients if necessary. The endothelial dysfunction markers, as well as
   other biochemical markers, were measured in all subjects at baseline,
   and after 6 months of levothyroxine treatment following the
   euthyroidism.
   Results: Our study showed higher ADMA (248.00 (168.78-540.20) vs. 166.30
   (140.60-243.40) mug/L, P = 0.002), endocan (114.30 (63.45-194.65) vs.
   67.26 (50.80-126.10) ng/L, P = 0.004), low-density lipoprotein
   cholesterol (LDL) (3.3 ± 0.6 vs. 3.7 ± 0.9 mmol/L, P = 0.043) and
   non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL) (3.8 ± 0.7 vs. 4.2 ±
   1.0 mmol/L, P = 0.020) concentrations in patients with a mild form of
   SCH in comparison with healthy subjects. In SCH patients, after 6 months
   of levothyroxine treatment following the euthyroidism, we observed a
   significant decrease in endocan (91.47 (61.88-200.03) vs. 97.90
   (55.18-154.88) ng/L, P = 0.004), and total cholesterol concentrations
   (CHOL) (6.2 ± 1.0 vs. 5.8 ± 1.0 mmol/L, P = 0.039).
   Conclusions: A mild form of SCH is associated with higher concentrations
   of endocan, ADMA, LDL and non-HDL. The potential benefits of
   levothyroxine therapy were shown through the significant decrease of
   endocan and CHOL concentrations in SCH patients, thus contributing the
   atherosclerosis prevention.

AB Artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography (AI-ECG) can
   identify hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) on 12-lead ECGs and offers a
   novel way to monitor treatment response. Although the surgical or
   percutaneous reduction of the interventricular septum (SRT) represented
   initial HCM therapies, mavacamten offers an oral alternative. We aimed
   to assess the use of AI-ECG as a strategy to evaluate biologic responses
   to SRT and mavacamten. We applied an AI-ECG model for HCM detection to
   electrocardiography images from patients who underwent SRT across 3
   sites: Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS), Cleveland Clinic Foundation
   (CCF), and Atlantic Health System (AHS) and to electrocardiography
   images from patients receiving mavacamten at YNHHS. A total of 70
   patients underwent SRT at YNHHS, 100 at CCF, and 145 at AHS. At YNHHS,
   there was no significant change in the AI-ECG HCM score before versus
   after SRT (before SRT: median 0.55 [interquartile range 0.24 to 0.77] vs
   after SRT: 0.59 [0.40 to 0.75]). The AI-ECG HCM scores also did not
   improve after SRT at CCF (0.61 [0.32 to 0.79] vs 0.69 [0.52 to 0.79])
   and AHS (0.52 [0.35 to 0.69] vs 0.61 [0.49 to 0.70]). Of the 36 YNHHS
   patients on mavacamten therapy, the median AI-ECG score before starting
   mavacamten was 0.41 (0.22 to 0.77), which decreased significantly to
   0.28 (0.11 to 0.50, p <0.001 by Wilcoxon signed-rank test) at the end of
   a median follow-up period of 237 days. In conclusion, we observed a lack
   of improvement in AI-based HCM score with SRT, in contrast to a
   significant decrease with mavacamten. Our approach suggests the
   potential role of AI-ECG for serial point-of-care monitoring of
   pathophysiologic improvement after medical therapy in HCM using ECG
   images.

AB With the coronavirus-2019 epidemic, disposable surgical masks have
   become a common personal protective necessity. However, off-the-shelf
   masks have low filtration efficiency and short service life and can only
   physically isolate pathogens, easily leading to secondary infection and
   cross-infection between users. Additionally, they produce debris and
   microplastics, which can be inhaled by the human body and cause serious
   diseases. To address this, this study introduced a brand-new,
   microplastic-free, long-life, biodegradable, self-disinfecting, and
   gas-sensitive mask made of basal dialdehyde-chitosan crosslinked
   animal-collagen/plant composite fibers (CPMask) with an asymmetric
   bilayer structure using scalable paper-processing technology. The
   CP-Mask demonstrated outstanding filtration performance (95.9 %) for
   particulate matter with various sizes and constantly maintained
   filtration efficiency even after 20 friction cycles. The CP-Mask also
   exhibited stable and lasting antibacterial properties, with significant
   inhibition rates of 99.21 % for Staphylococcus aureus and 98.86 % for
   Escherichia coli and could effectively filter bacterial aerosols. In
   addition, CP-Mask realized the real-time detection of respiratory
   ammonia concentration and timely identified the ammonia level. The
   average response value was 68.26 %, and the average response time was
   159.3 s, presenting good circulatory stability and is suitable for early
   diagnosis of ammonia-related diseases. Breakthrough, the origin of
   natural ingredients, fundamentally makes CP-Mask less likely to emit
   microplastics than commercially available masks and endows it with
   complete biodegradability in soil within three months, eliminating the
   risk of microplastic inhalation from the source. The proposed CP-Mask
   provides a new idea to facilitate personal health monitoring and
   portability of medical protection equipment regarding biocompatibility,
   biodegradability, self-disinfection, and ammonia sensing ability.

AB AlSi10Mg is an aluminium alloy preferred in the automotive, medical, and
   aerospace industries due to its engineering properties such as
   lightness, high corrosion resistance, and excellent castability. In
   metal-based additive manufacturing, offset value, laser power, and
   scanning speed are important manufacturing parameters. These parameters
   significantly impact the formation of defects that adversely affect the
   microstructure, mechanical properties, surface quality, and dimensional
   accuracy of the final product. Therefore, it is imperative to select
   these parameters correctly during the manufacturing process. In this
   context, the study focuses on improving product quality in the additive
   manufacturing of AlSi10Mg alloy, and samples were produced using
   different contour process parameters. The production of samples was
   carried out according to the Taguchi L27 orthogonal experimental design.
   Three different offset values (0.140-0.175-0.210 mm), three different
   laser powers (160-200-240 W), and three different scanning speeds
   (280-350-420 mm/s) were utilized as contour process parameters. At the
   conclusion of the study, it was determined that there are ideal process
   parameters for achieving high mechanical properties, low surface
   roughness, and dimensional accuracy according to nominal values. It was
   observed that the product quality decreased in samples produced with
   non-ideal parameters. Yield strength decreased by 4.12 % with an
   increase in the offset value from 0.140 mm to 0.175 mm, and by 3.83 %
   with an increase from 0.175 to 0.210 mm. Increasing the offset value
   from 0.140 mm to 0.175 mm resulted in a decrease in tensile strength by
   1.94 % and increasing it from 0.175 mm to 0.210 mm resulted in a
   decrease of 2.83 %. The decrease in mechanical properties was attributed
   to the occurring defects. The lowest Ra value (2.011 mu m) was measured
   at a 0.140 mm offset value, with a laser power of 200 W, and a scanning
   speed of 280 mm/s. For all offset values, the deviation in thickness
   measurement varies between approximately -5.13 % and + 4.96 %, and the
   deviation in width measurement varies between -1.89 and + 1.33.
   Multi-response optimization was conducted for mechanical properties,
   surface roughness, and dimensional accuracy using the Taguchibased gray
   relational analysis method. According to the experimental results, the
   optimal contour process parameters for additive manufacturing of
   AlSi10Mg alloy were obtained as 0.140 mm offset value, 200 W laser
   power, and 280 mm/s scanning speed.

AB Background: Major depression in the older population has a profound
   impact on patients' quality of life and is associated with an increased
   risk of developing several medical illnesses. Psychophysiological
   methods, such as electroencephalography (EEG), functional near-infrared
   spectroscopy (fNIRS), and eye-tracking, have provided evidence of
   physiological changes associated with depression in adult life. However,
   these aspects have not been thoroughly investigated during late-life
   (over 60 years of age). Methods: A systematic review of the scientific
   literature covering the studies published between 1990 and 2022 was
   performed to describe the current evidence on easily attainable
   psychophysiological factors (detected by EEG, fNIRS and eye-tracking)
   associated with depression in late-life. Results: Twelve studies were
   included in the systematic review. The included studies showed some
   consistent physiological patterns associated with late-life depression,
   such as brain hypoactivation in frontal and temporal areas and
   attentional biases toward emotional stimuli. No reliable patterns in EEG
   asymmetry and power spectrum were found, in contrast to studies on
   early-life depression. Limitations: The small number of available
   studies, together with the heterogeneity in the techniques and methods
   used, highlight the need for further research to reliably identify the
   psychophysiological aspects of depression in late-life. Conclusions:
   Physiological indices of late-life depression, as assessed by EEG, fNIRS
   and eye-tracking, may differ from those of early-life. The study of
   these indices could better clarify the physiological mechanisms
   underlying late-life depression with possible clinical and research
   implications. Recommendations for future research are also discussed.

   stringent demands on spatial positioning algorithms. Traditional methods
   are usually limited to polynomial fitting, which limits the
   generalization of the algorithm and the positioning accuracy of the near
   field part. In this paper, we introduce a magnetic positioning algorithm
   grounded in the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (MP-KAN), innovatively
   introduces the neural network method into the magnetic positioning
   system, providing a novel research idea for the positioning algorithm.
   Distinguishing from the learnable weight parameters inherent in the
   traditional model, the KAN network introduces a learnable activation
   function formulated through spline functions. This innovation enhances
   model accuracy by leveraging multiple spline curves and executing
   summation operations at nodes to facilitate regression predictions.
   Furthermore, the residual of the predicted position and the L1-parameter
   in the KAN layer and its entropy regularization are used as the
   prediction loss, and thresholds are strategically set at the network
   nodes to enhance the generalization ability of the model and obtain the
   optimal configuration. The proposed method achieves the goal of
   improving the positioning accuracy of the system while ensuring that the
   algorithm has a nearly constant positioning accuracy regardless of the
   distance between the target and the measurement system. The results of
   an experimental demonstrate that the maximum positioning error within
   the data set stands at 0.24 mm, the maximum relative error is 5.72 %,
   the minimum relative error is 0.25 %.

AB The aim of this study was to test the effect of different management
   strategies for artificial substrates on the nitrification process,
   microbial composition of water and biofilm, and growth of Penaeus
   vannamei in a superintensive biofloc system. The research was conducted
   over 60 days using experimental units of 200 L and had the following
   treatments: T1 - artificial substrate + biofloc + shrimp + aeration
   (control), T2 - artificial substrate + water + aeration, T3 - artificial
   substrate + water, and T4 - only artificial substrate. The experiment
   was divided into two phases. Phase 1 involved maintaining the artificial
   substrates under the management strategy for 30 days. Phase 2 involved
   the use of substrates from phase 1 in a shrimp nursery for 30 days. Pre
   colonized artificial substrates (Needlona (R)) were employed at a ratio
   of 200 % of the tank's lateral area to promote biofilm growth. In the
   phase 1, T1 used a stocking density of 500 shrimp m-3 (9.72 +/- 0.50 g).
   In phase 2, shrimp weighing 0.10 +/- 0.05 g were stocked at a density of
   1750 shrimp m- 3 and all treatments included artificial substrates from
   phase 1, aeration, water, and shrimp. Molasses was the carbon source
   organic used. In phase 2, ammonia control was observed in treatments T2,
   T3, and T4 from the 10th day onwards. T4 had a nitrite spike, controlled
   from day 14 onwards, suggesting recovery of the nitrifying bacteria
   community. At the end of the phase 2, T2 and T4 showed higher abundance
   of coccoid bacteria in the biofilm compared to T1 and T3. T4 also had
   more bacillus. The shrimp final weight was higher in T2 compared to the
   other treatments. These findings suggest that maintaining the substrate
   submerged in water (T3) can be considered a practical management for
   artificial substrates and that it does not limit the nitrification
   process between culture cycles. Furthermore, exposure of artificial
   substrates to air (T4) also did not affect the nitrification process,
   leading to the recovery of the bacterial community, and the
   proliferation of various bacterial groups.

AB Proteins are an essential component of living organisms, and the study
   of their structure and function is of great importance in biological and
   medical research. In recent years, the remarkable phenomenon of
   aggregationinduced emission (AIE) has been extensively utilized in
   protein detection. Significant progress has been made in the development
   of aggregation-induced emission luminogens (AIEgens), which have proven
   invaluable in protein imaging. This review highlights AIEgen-conjugated
   probes for imaging proteins in tumor cells through various mechanisms,
   including physical interactions, ligand binding, and enzymatic cleavage.
   These probes exploit the AIE effect to enhance the signal-to-noise
   ratio, providing important tools for protein research. Additionally,
   these probes can be used to study structural changes in intracellular
   protein phase separation processes, such as unfolded, misfolded,
   fibrous, and amorphous aggregates. The above research achievements
   presented lay the foundation for the widespread application of
   AIEgen-conjugated probes in the biomedical field and are expected to
   stimulate further development in related research.

AB Facilitating swift burn wound healing while effectively preventing scar
   formation continues to be a considerable challenge in medical practice.
   In this study, an injectable carboxymethyl chitosan/oxidized
   dextran/polyvinylpyrrolidone/dopamine (COPD) hydrogel was designed for
   the effective sequentially promotion of burn wound healing and
   inhibition of scar formation. The COPD hydrogel precursor solution was
   injected into the burn wound via a double-barreled syringe and
   transformed into an adherent hydrogel within 25 s. The inclusion of
   dopamine imparted good free radical scavenging properties to the
   hydrogel. In particular, the gradual oxidation of dopamine to
   polydopamine enabled a unique heat production pattern-initially slow
   (photothermal conversion efficiency: 30.3 %) and then rapidly
   temperature increasing (photothermal conversion efficiency: 42.8 %)
   -under single laser irradiation. The effect of promoting healing at the
   initial stage of the wound was evaluated by constructing a male C57BL/6
   mice model with deep second-degree burns, observation of the wound area,
   PCR analysis, and immunohistochemical staining. Furthermore, the scar
   inhibition was confirmed by observing reduced expression levels of
   alpha-SMA and COL-I, along with a decreased collagen I/III ratio. With
   tunable mechanical properties (maximum compressive strength of 966.4 +/-
   51.7 kPa), the COPD hydrogel holds significant promise as an adjunctive
   photothermal platform for intelligent burn wound management.

AB This study examined the effects of the alkaline Maillard reaction on the
   structural, interfacial, and functional properties of soybean 11S
   globulin-debranched starch (DBS) conjugates. The results showed that the
   degree of DBS binding to 11S globulin was influenced by the polymer
   ratios, which in turn affected the structural, interfacial, and
   functional characteristics. The 11S-DBS conjugates with a 2:1 biopolymer
   ratio exhibited the highest grafting degree, largest zeta potential
   absolute value, smallest particle size, and greatest thermal stability.
   Conjugates with higher globulin content demonstrated superior
   interfacial and functional properties, including improved solubility,
   increased surface hydrophobicity, and reduced interfacial tension. 3D
   fluorescence scanning revealed a decrease in the signal of aromatic
   amino acid residues, while microstructural observation provided insights
   into the binding behavior of different 11S-DBS conjugates. Molecular
   docking simulations highlighted the key role of hydrogen bonding in the
   formation of these conjugates. This study enhances understanding of
   soybean globulin-polysaccharide interaction mechanisms, expanding their
   potential applications in the food, medical, and bioengineering
   industries.

AB During stressful conditions, the human body synthesizes catecholamine
   neurotransmitters such as dopamine and adrenaline, and cortisol. The
   monitoring of these three molecules levels is crucial for stress
   management and holds significant medical applications. Here we developed
   an analytical device that incorporates a biomimetic (tongue-mimic)
   associated with an optical physico-chemical transducer, able to detect
   simultaneously cortisol, dopamine and adrenaline in human saliva without
   pre-treatments, using an array sensor based on fluorescent chemical
   receptors (BODIPY, Rhodamine, and Naphthylamides) able to interact by
   non-covalent interaction with cortisol, adrenaline and dopamine, leading
   to a change of the emission. Calibration, recovery and selectivity have
   been performed to validate the device. In particular, the linear
   responses of the array to concentration range of 1 pM-1mM of the three
   analytes were demonstrated by PLS analysis, as well as the high
   selectivity by PLS-DA analysis performed with artificial saliva samples.
   Analyses in real human saliva samples, compared to the validated
   analytical methods, demonstrated that our prototype represents the first
   point-of-care device able to quantify these three analytes in human
   saliva with one single analysis in a wider concentration range respect
   to the other standard methods.

AB Literature about sterilization of pharmaceutical substances is limited.
   The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nitrogen dioxide
   (NO2) sterilization, a new emerging technology, on five different
   ophthalmic active pharmaceutical ingredients, i.e., tetracycline
   hydrochloride, aciclovir, dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and
   triamcinolone. The NO2 process concentrations tested were 5, 10, and 20
   mg/L. The applied temperature was 21 degrees C and the relative humidity
   30%. The process cycle consisted of two pulses with a dwell time of 10
   min each. Non-processed samples were used as a blank. The effect of the
   sterilization method was assessed by high performance liquid
   chromatography coupled to an ultraviolet/visible detector, used for the
   quantitative analysis of the degradation products and the relative
   content of the evaluated ophthalmic medicines. For tetracycline
   hydrochloride and aciclovir, an increase of impurities was observed by
   increasing the NO2 concentration. The maximum permissible NO2
   concentrations were estimated to be 10 mg/L and 2.5 mg/L, respectively,
   considering the requirement for the impurities to be within the limit
   stated in the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.). For both compounds,
   samples subjected to 20 mg/L NO2 demonstrated a significant difference
   in content compared to the non-processed sample. For methylprednisolone,
   dexamethasone, and triamcinolone, impurities complied with the limits of
   the Ph. Eur. for each NO2 concentration and relative contents were not
   significantly affected. Sterilization of tetracycline hydrochloride and
   aciclovir with NO2 is not recommended due to extensive degradation. NO2
   sterilization of methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone
   could find its application within the aseptic processing procedure of
   related pharmaceuticals.

AB Background: Allergic symptoms and depression are prevalent ailments in
   childbearing age women. This study assessed the risk of maternal
   postpartum depression (PPD) associated with prenatal allergic disorders.
   Methods: From 1,017,507 eligible women of 20-49 years old with singleton
   live births and 20-week or more gestational age in the birth registry of
   Taiwan, from 2011 to 2020, we identified cohorts with and without
   allergic disorders matched by propensity score in the size of 457,826.
   Cumulative incident PPDs in one year after births were assessed from
   insurance claims data. Odds ratios (OR) of PPD were measured by each
   allergic type and multiple types, comparing with the controls. Results:
   With an overall cumulative PPD incidence 1.25-fold higher in the
   allergic cohort than in the controls (0.69 % versus 0.55 %), the rate
   was the highest in women with asthma: 0.94 % with an adjusted OR of 1.71
   (95 % CI = 1.49-1.95), followed by those with allergic rhinitis,
   allergic conjunctivitis and atopic dermatitis. The rate increased from
   0.65 % for those with one allergic disorder to 1.06 % for those with 4
   or 5 disorders, and the corresponding adjusted OR increased from 1.17
   (95 % CI = 1.10-1.24) to 1.92 (95 % CI = 1.36-2.69). Limitation: The
   claims data lack detailed information on socio-demographic status,
   lifestyle, laboratory result, physical activity, and family medical
   history. Conclusions: Women with prenatal allergic disorder(s) are at an
   increased risk of PPD in addition to the impact of pregnancy. Prompt and
   efficient intervention for PPD prevention is needed for women with
   allergic disorders, particularly for those with asthma and multiple
   disorders.

   results focused on TPCPC's stability and reactivity. The electrical
   characteristics and binding sites of the molecule were further
   investigated through molecular electrostatic potential, ELF&LOL, and
   Mulliken charges distribution. The oral rat LD50 for TPCPC was also
   predicted using the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (T.E.S.T.). This

   hypochlorite, the solution's color visibly changes from red to yellow to
   the naked eye, and a strong yellowish green fluorescence is observed
   under UV light at 365 nm. AMXM demonstrates an excellent linear response
   (R-2 = 0.9922), with a low detection limit of 56.2 nM, and is unaffected
   by other potential interfering substances. The mechanism of AMXM's
   response to hypochlorite ions was confirmed through H-1 NMR spectroscopy
   and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, AMXM was
   successfully applied to paper test strips and used for the quantitative
   determination of hypochlorite ions in four real water samples.

AB Accurate identification of brain tumors using magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) is crucial for clinical decision- making and surgery planning.
   However, it is a challenging task due to the diverse and complex nature
   of tumors. Some existing U-Net variants are outperformed in the brain
   tumor segmentation tasks, but these models usually have large parameters
   and limited ability to extract image features. In addition, the semantic
   difference between encoder and decoder also affects the segmentation
   performance of U-Net based variant network models. To address the above
   problems, anew segmentation network model called MLFINet is proposed
   based on a 3D U-Net structure. In this model, a dual separable
   convolution squeeze-and-excitation (DSSE) module is first designed to
   extract image features more efficiently while reducing the number of
   model parameters, and then a multi-level feature interaction module
   (MFIM) is designed to enhance semantic interaction between different
   levels. In addition, structural similarity (SSIM) loss is considered to
   help the model better identify and segment complex boundaries and
   details. Extensive experiments are conducted on open-source datasets,
   and the results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms selected
   baselines in terms of several metrics, achieving the dice score of
   86.63%, 85.79%, 94.10% on the BraTS2018, BraTS2020 and LiTS17 dataset,

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: According to the theory of traditional
   Chinese medicine, Graves' disease (GD) is called 'Ying Bing', which is a
   kind of goiter. Haizao Yuhu decoction, originated from the medical book
   of the Ming Dynasty 'Waikezhengzong', is a classic Chinese herbal
   formula for the treatment of 'Ying Bing' for more than 400 years.
   Pingkang granules, modified from the Chinese herbal formula Haizao Yuhu
   decoction specialized in GD, has shown effectiveness in several
   single-centre studies. However, high-quality clinical evidence for the
   management of GD using Pingkang granules remains insufficient. Aim of
   the study: To obtain high-quality medical evidence for the treatment of
   GD with Pingkang granules through randomized controlled clinical trial.
   Materials and methods: A multicentre, randomized, double-blinded,
   placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed. A total of 186 patients
   with Graves' hyperthyroidism from five medical centers were randomly
   assigned to receive methimazole [MMI] and Pingkang granules placebo
   (group A), MMI and Pingkang granules (group B), or MMI placebo and
   Pingkang granules (group C) in a 1:1:1 ratio for 12 weeks. The primary
   clinical outcomes were serum free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free
   thyroxine (FT4) levels from baseline until the end of the research.
   Secondary clinical outcomes included serum thyrotrophin receptor
   antibody (TRAb) levels at 4- and 12-weeks post-intervention, thyroid
   volume, peak systolic velocity of the superior thyroid artery (STA-PSV),
   39-item version of Thyroid-Related Patient-Reported Outcome (ThyPRO39)
   scores, and safety assessment included blood routine, liver and kidney
   function tests from baseline to the endpoint. Results: 150 patients were
   included in the full analysis set for efficacy analysis, including 48,
   50, and 52 in groups A, B, and C, respectively. At the endpoint, three
   regimens significantly reduced serum FT3 levels (group A, p =0.0027;
   group B, p < 0.0001; group C, p =0.0028) and FT4 levels (group A, p <
   0.0001; group B, p < 0.0001; group C, p < 0.0001), and the combination
   of MMI and Pingkang granules markedly reduced serum TRAb levels (p =
   0.0014). The thyroid volume in group A was significantly larger than
   that at baseline at week 12 (p=0.0370), and there were no statistically
   significant differences in the thyroid volume among groups at week 4
   (p=0.7485) and 12 (p=0.1333). STA-PSV values in group B were
   significantly higher than those in group A at week 4 (p=0.0409). The
   STA-PSV levels in groups A (p < 0.0001) and C (p=0.0025) were
   significantly lower than those at baseline at week 4, and STA-PSV levels
   in all groups were significantly lower than those at baseline at week 12
   (group A, p =0.0095; group B, p =0.0138; group C, p =0.0423). Pingkang
   granule monotherapy significantly ameliorated symptoms related to
   hyperthyroidism (p < 0.0001), eye (p=0.0490), tiredness (p < 0.0001),
   cognition (p < 0.0001), depression (p=0.0478), and susceptibility
   (p=0.0052). No severe adverse events were reported in either group or
   three regimens showed similar safety. Conclusions: Pingkang granules
   significantly reduced serum FT3, FT4 and STA-PSV levels, improved
   ThyPRO39 scores, and lowered serum TRAb levels when combined with MMI in
   patients with Grave's hyperthyroidism.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Yougui Pill (YGP), originating from
   Jingyue Quanshu, comprises 10 traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). This
   classic prescription is renowned for its ability to tonify the kidney,
   warm the kidney, promote yang, warm the interior, and dispel cold. YGP
   has proven effective in treating degenerative knee arthritis,
   osteoporosis, delayed fracture healing, and other orthopedic conditions,
   making it a widely used clinical prescription for knee osteoarthritis
   (KOA). Aim of the study: Although YGP is commonly used in clinical
   practice, its pharmacodynamic material basis and anti-arthritis
   mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to comprehensively analyze
   the chemical constituents of YGP and elucidate its anti-arthritis
   mechanisms. Materials and methods: Ultra-high performance liquid
   chromatography coupled with electrospray ionizationtriple
   quadrupole-linear ion trap mass spectrometry(ESI-Q TRAP-MS/MS) was used
   to identify the chemical constituents of YGP. The Hulth method was
   utilized to establish KOA rat model, and pathological examinations were
   performed to assess the anti-arthritis effects of YGP. Integrated
   metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses were conducted to explore the
   anti-arthritis mechanisms of YGP. Key targets were confirmed via
   immunohistochemistry. Results: A total of 1981 chemical components were
   identified in YGP, predominantly phenolic acids and flavonoids. Compared
   with the model group, 422 differentially expressed metabolites and 214
   differentially expressed genes were identified, primarily involving the
   MAPK signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt pathway.
   YGP exerted an anti-osteoarthritis effect by inhibiting the excessive
   activation of the EGFR/ERT/FOS signaling pathway. Conclusions: TCM
   offers significant advantages in the treatment of KOA, addressing the
   shortcomings of current clinical medications. YGP displayed exceptional
   pharmacodynamic effects. This study elucidated its pharmacodynamic
   material basis and anti-osteoarthritis mechanisms, providing substantial
   support for its clinical application and the development of related
   drugs.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), a
   group of prevalent and persistent immune-mediated disorders affecting
   the endocrine system, can progressively result in total thyroid failure,
   thereby drastically impacting metabolic processes. Given the
   inadequacies of current clinical approaches to managing AITD, The
   exigency to investigate novel therapeutic strategies demands immediate
   attention, given the limitations and potential resistances associated
   with conventional approaches. Si-Ni-San (SNS), first chronicled in the
   esteemed Eastern Han Dynasty medical text" Treatise on Cold Damage and
   Miscellaneous Diseases" circa 200-210 AD, is a time-honored remedy known
   for its harmonizing effects on the liver and invigorating properties for
   the spleen. Research indicates that saikosaponins and peony glycosides,
   two primary constituents of SNS, possess anti-inflammatory properties
   and can ameliorate immune dysfunction in the treatment of AITD. Despite
   initial insights, a comprehensive exploration of the underlying
   mechanisms by which SNS alleviates AITD symptoms requires further
   in-depth investigation to decipher their intricate interplay. Aim of the
   study: This study aimed to identify the key therapeutic components of
   SNS for the treatment of AITD and to elucidate the underlying molecular
   mechanisms, revealing potential targets. Materials and methods: We
   initially screened prospective components of SNS for AITD therapy
   through comprehensive database exploration, followed by an evaluation of
   the results via PPI networks. To illuminate the therapeutic mechanisms
   of SNS in AITD, we employed GO enrichment analysis and surveyed the KEGG
   pathways. Employing UHPLC-QE-MS, we conducted an in-depth analysis of
   SNS's principal elements, complemented by molecular docking studies to
   unravel their interaction dynamics. Finally, we substantiated the
   central therapeutic pathway of SNS in the treatment of AITD using an
   experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) mouse model, validated
   meticulously through in vivo experimentation. Results: Network
   pharmacology analysis revealed 32 common targets from the overlap
   between SNS and AITDrelated targets. Based on subsequent PPI network and
   KEGG analysis, we focused on the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3/IL-17 pathway, which
   drives the differentiation of Th17 cells, as a central therapeutic
   target of SNS in AITD. Crucially, our in vivo findings, substantiated
   through immunohistochemical, Western blot, RT-qPCR analyses and Flow
   cytometry analysis, reveal SNS's therapeutic potential in AITD. It
   effectively dampens IL-6 production, inhibits IL-6/JAK2/STAT3/IL-17
   pathway activation, and rebalances the Th17/Treg cell ratio, thus
   elucidating its antiinflammatory mechanism. Conclusions: The protective
   effect of SNS against AITD is likely mediated through the modulation of
   the IL-6/ JAK2/STAT3/IL-17 pathway and the restoration of balance within
   the Th17/Treg ratio. This suggests that SNS may exert its therapeutic
   effects on AITD by targeting these key molecular mechanisms, thereby
   providing a novel perspective for the treatment of AITD.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have
   altered the landscape of tumor immunotherapy, offering novel therapeutic
   approaches alongside surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy and
   significantly improving survival benefits. However, their clinical
   efficacy is limited in some patients, and their use may cause
   immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Integrating traditional Chinese
   medicine (TCM) with ICIs has demonstrated the potential to boost
   sensitization and reduce toxicity. Clinical trials and experimental
   explorations have confirmed that TCM and its active components
   synergistically enhance the effectiveness of ICIs. Aims: This narrative
   review summarizes the TCM practices that enhance the clinical efficacy
   and reduce irAEs of ICIs. This paper also summarizes the mechanism of
   experimental studies on the synergies of Chinese herbal decoctions,
   Chinese herbal preparation, and Chinese herbal active ingredients. Most
   of the studies on TCM combined with ICIs are basic experiments. We
   discussed the mechanism of TCM enhanced ICIs to provide reference for
   the research and development of TCM adjuvant immunotherapy. Methods: We
   conducted a literature search using PubMed and Chinese National
   Knowledge Infrastructure databases, with a focus on herbal decoction,
   Chinese medicine preparations, and active ingredients that boost the
   effectiveness of ICIs and reduce irAEs. The search keywords were "ICIs
   and traditional Chinese medicine", "PD-1 and traditional Chinese
   medicine", "PD-L1 and traditional Chinese medicine", "CTLA-4 and
   traditional Chinese medicine", "IDO1 and traditional Chinese medicine",
   "Tim-3 and traditional Chinese medicine", "TIGIT and traditional Chinese
   medicine", "irAEs and traditional Chinese medicine". The search period
   was from May 2014 to May 2024. Articles involving the use of TCM or its
   components in combination with ICIs and investigating the underlying
   mechanisms were screened. Finally, 30 Chinese medicines used in
   combination with ICIs were obtained to explore the mechanism. In the
   part of immune checkpoint molecules other than PD-1, there were few
   studies on the combined application of TCM, so studies involving the
   regulation of immune checkpoint molecules by TCM were included. Results:
   TCM has been shown to boost the effectiveness of ICIs and reduce irAEs.
   Researchers indicate that TCM and its active components can work
   synergistically with ICIs by regulating immune checkpoints PD-1, PD-L1,
   CTLA-4, and IDO1, regulating intestinal flora, improving tumor
   microenvironment and more. Conclusions: Combining TCM with ICIs can play
   a better anti-tumor role, but larger samples and high-quality clinical
   trials are necessary to confirm this. Many Chinese medicines and their
   ingredients have been shown to sensitize ICIs in experimental studies,
   which provides a rich choice for the subsequent development of ICI
   enhancers.

AB Image super-resolution involves reconstructing a blurry, low-resolution
   image with limited information into a clear, high-resolution image
   containing more detailed information. The images generated by
   super-resolution reconstruction can enhance the performance of
   downstream computer vision tasks, and hold wide application prospects in
   fields such as industrial fault detection, plant phenotype parameter
   extraction, medical imaging, and more. High-frequency components in
   images, such as edges and texture details, typically require more
   attention. However, when the training samples are limited, effectively
   recovering clear high-frequency details of images becomes highly
   challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes a single-image
   super-resolution method based on generative adversarial networks, named
   DESRGAN. Compared to existing methods, DESRGAN achieves better
   reconstruction of image details even with a limited number of training
   samples. DESRGAN introduces several key innovations: a shallow generator
   structure to address overfitting issues in small sample scenarios, a
   dual-stream feature extraction network with dilated convolutions to
   capture multi-scale contextual information and expand the receptive
   field, and an artifact loss designed to eliminate artifacts and preserve
   the true high-frequency details of the super-resolved images. Extensive
   ablation experiments and comparative studies with multiple
   state-of-the-art models are conducted on two small sample datasets,
   "Root" and "Leaves," as well as five publicly available datasets. The
   results demonstrate that the proposed DESRGAN achieves superior
   performance in small sample single image super-resolution tasks, with
   improvements of 1.39 dB in PSNR and 0.013 in SSIM. The generated
   high-resolution images exhibit clear texture and edge structures,
   presenting favorable subjective visual effects. Moreover, the model
   displays strong generalization capabilities.

AB Effective computer-aided detection and diagnosis algorithms are being
   sought to carry out complex pattern recognition with great precision
   while increasing efficiency and robustness through automation. In this
   study, we leveraged self-constructing graph (SCG) and autoregressive
   moving average (ARMA) graph convolution to postprocess multi-level
   feature maps obtained from an Inception V3 network for medical image
   classification. The adopted SCG learns latent embeddings from the
   feature maps, which are subsequently used to construct graph topology
   based on embedding similarity. The ARMA convolution then learns to
   encode more flexible spectral filter responses that simultaneously takes
   into account long-range dependencies from the SCG graph. The proposed
   IncARMAG model was evaluated on 2D MedMNIST datasets, which consist of
   several imaging modalities and classification tasks in the medical
   domain. Results from our experiments on MedMNIST datasets showed that
   IncARMAG outperformed state-of-the-art models on many cases. IncARMAG
   has also achieved the highest accuracy based on evaluation of various
   benchmark CNN, transformers, and hybrid models on four selected
   datasets. These results highlight how IncARMAG is a strong candidate in
   medical image analysis involving classification tasks.

AB Multi-modal medical images serve as a critical basis for disease
   diagnosis. However, sharing multi-modal medical data between hospitals
   is a significant challenge due to privacy protection concerns as well as
   the substantial costs associated with data transfer and storage. These
   hurdles are further compounded by two primary issues: (1) the complexity
   involved in sharing data features, which arises from the intricate
   process of multi-modal image registration; (2) the difficulty and high
   cost of acquiring accurate data labels. To address these issues, we
   propose a novel multi-modal medical dataset distillation method based on
   contrastive learning. We consider each modality as a unique approach to
   data augmentation for the corresponding imaging region, offering a
   unique perspective on the same anatomical region, which is then fused to
   collectively contribute to a comprehensive global representation of the
   medical image. Validation results on two datasets indicate our method is
   capable of reducing the original dataset to just 5% of its original size
   while retaining classification performance comparable to that of the
   full dataset, and notably, this efficiency is achieved using only 30% of
   the total labels, which significantly lowers the cost and effort
   associated with dataset labeling.

AB The performance of neural network is largely dependent on their
   capability to extract very discriminant features supporting the
   characterization of abnormalities in the medical image. Several
   benchmark architectures have been proposed and the use of transfer
   learning has further made these architectures return good performances.
   Study has shown that the use of optimization algorithms for selection of
   relevant features has improved classifiers. However continuous
   optimization algorithms have mostly been used though it allows variables
   to take value within a range of values. The advantage of binary
   optimization algorithms is that it allows variables to be assigned only
   two states, and this have been sparsely applied to medical image feature
   optimization. This study therefore proposes hybrid binary optimization
   algorithms to efficiently identify optimal features subset in medical
   image feature sets. The binary dwarf mongoose optimizer (BDMO) and the
   particle swarm optimizer (PSO) were hybridized with the binary Ebola
   optimization search algorithm (BEOSA) on new nested transfer functions.
   Medical images passed through convolutional neural networks (CNN)
   returns extracted features into a continuous space which are piped
   through these new hybrid binary optimizers. Features in continuous space
   a mapped into binary space for optimization, and then mapped back into
   the continuous space for classification. Experimentation was conducted
   on medical image samples using the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of
   Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM+CBIS). Results obtained
   from the evaluation of the hybrid binary optimization methods showed
   that they yielded outstanding classification accuracy, fitness, and cost
   function values of 0.965, 0.021 and 0.943. To investigate the
   statistical significance of the hybrid binary methods, the analysis of
   variance (ANOVA) test was conducted based on the two-factor analysis on
   the classification accuracy, fitness, and cost metrics. Furthermore,
   results returned from application of the binary hybrid methods medical
   image analysis showed classification accuracy of 0.8286, precision of
   0.97, recall of 0.83, and F1-score of 0.99, AUC of 0.8291. Findings from
   the study showed that contrary to the popular approach of using
   continuous metaheuristic algorithms for feature selection problem, the
   binary metaheuristic algorithms are well suitable for handling the
   challenge. Complete source code can be accessed from:

AB Noise, out-of-distribution (OOD) challenges, and boundary ambiguity are
   not only challenges in skin disease segmentation, but also difficulties
   in the field of medical image segmentation. Although various medical
   image segmentation networks have emerged, there are certain limitations
   in addressing these issues because previous research has neglected the
   expression of medical image features in latent space. In this article,
   we study the relationship between latent space information and medical
   image segmentation. We demonstrate that the decoupling of multi-class
   information in latent space is closely related to the accuracy of
   medical image segmentation. Therefore, this study proposes a new
   segmentation scheme - Contextual directional decoupling network
   (CodeNet), which aims to enhance feature representation by decoupling
   multi-class information in latent space, enabling the model to
   successfully address noise, artifacts, OOD challenges, and boundary
   ambiguity. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets and one
   private dataset show that our proposed CodeNet is superior to other
   state-of-the-art models and achieves good performance on multiple
   commonly used metrics. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our method
   in skin lesion segmentation.

AB Federated Learning (FL) is a framework designed to enable distributed
   and privacy-preserving learning. It typically involves a central server
   coordinating multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model
   without the need for sharing private data. Recent studies have revealed
   that this parameter-only communication strategy can be hindered by
   non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data across
   clients, leading to statistical heterogeneity. This issue necessitates
   the development of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), which aims to
   enhance the performance of individual clients while still allowing for
   the learning of a global model. Most existing work on PFL has focused on
   label shift in supervised tasks, with relatively little attention given
   to feature shift, another common problem in real-world applications of
   federated learning. For instance, client data may vary in terms of
   illumination, angles, and quality for natural images, or in imaging
   protocols for medical images. To address this issue, we propose a
   general yet powerful framework that leverages the geometric
   interpretation of deep neural networks. Geometrically, a deep neural
   network partitions the feature space into a Power Diagram (PD) or
   Voronoi Diagram (VD). Regularized losses are introduced to mitigate
   feature shift from the perspective of PD and VD. Additionally, a
   personalized generator network is formulated for each client to rectify
   feature distribution and adapt the input data from its own domain to an
   "averaged" or unified domain that generalizes well across all clients.
   Our method demonstrates competitive performance compared to current
   state-of-the-art methods.

AB Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) severely affects the quality of
   life of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in the later stages.
   Recently, PD patients with diabetes were found to have a higher risk of
   cognitive decline and developing dementia with a faster progression, but
   the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Diabetes-related white matter
   damage may partially explain the mechanism by which diabetes
   participates in PDD. Seventy PD patients were included. PD patients
   underwent diffusion tensor imaging from The Second Affiliated Hospital
   of Chongqing Medical University were collected and were divided into
   four groups: PD with diabetes without dementia, PD with dementia without
   diabetes, PD without dementia and diabetes. Tract-based spatial
   statistics analysis and region-of-interest-based analysis were
   performed. Factorial analysis with diabetes and dementia taken as the
   main effects was performed, and the differences between the white matter
   fibers of PD patients from the four groups were also analyzed. The
   interaction between diabetes and dementia in the damage of white matter
   in PD patients was also analyzed. We found that both diabetes and
   dementia were found to be related to the damage in internal capsule,
   corona radiata, and thalamic radiation of the PD patients. There is an
   interaction between diabetes and dementia in the white matter damage of
   PD patients. Both diabetes and dementia were found to be related to the
   damage in internal capsule, corona radiata, and thalamic radiation of
   the PD patients. Diabetes may participate in cognitive decline in PD
   patients via damaging cognition-related white matter tracts.

AB Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a life-threatening and
   life-limiting disease with high mortality and disability rates. Herein,
   we aim to explore the preventive effect of aminocaproic acid combined
   with nimodipine on short-term rebleeding in patients with aSAH.
   Retrospectively, the medical data of patients with aSAH (n = 256) were
   collected. According to different treatment methods, patients were
   categorized into the aminocaproic acid + nimodipine group (n = 152) and
   the nimodipine group (n = 104), and were treated for 1 week. Baseline
   characteristics, incidence of rebleeding, average velocity of cerebral
   artery blood flow, cerebral vasospasm index, vascular endothelial
   function, complications, and adverse events were analyzed between the
   two groups. After 1-week treatment, compared to the nimodipine group,
   the aminocaproic acid + nimodipine group exhibited lower incidence of
   rebleeding, notable decreases in average velocity of cerebral artery
   blood flow and the cerebral vasospasm index, and downregulation of
   endothelin-1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (P < 0.05). There
   were no significant differences about complications and adverse events
   between the two groups. Aminocaproic acid combined with nimodipine is
   superior to nimodipine alone in preventing the short-term rebleeding in
   patients with aSAH, and has good safety.

AB Increasing morbidity and mortality in CRC is a potential threat to human
   health. The major challenges for better treatment outcomes are the
   heterogeneity of CRC cases, complicated molecular pathway cross-talks,
   the influence of gut dysbiosis in CRC, and the lack of multimodal
   target-specific drug delivery. The overexpression of many receptors in
   CRC cells may pave the path for targeting them with multiple ligands.
   The design of a more target-specific drug-delivery device with multiple
   ligand-functionalized, green-synthesized silver nanoparticles is highly
   promising and may also deliver other approved chemotherapeutic agents.
   This review presents the various aspects of colorectal cancer and
   over-expressed receptors that can be targeted with appropriate ligands
   to enhance the specific drug delivery potency of green synthesised
   silver nanoparticles. This review aims to broaden further research into
   this multi-ligand functionalised, safer and effective silver nano drug
   delivery system.

AB Objective: This study reports a novel heterozygous, likely truncating
   mutation in the diaphanous homolog 1 (DIAPH1) gene associated with
   non-syndromic hearing loss. Methods: Family members underwent
   audiological and imaging assessments, whole-exome sequencing (WES), and
   Sanger sequencing. Results: Sensorineural hearing loss was observed in
   all five individuals, with severity ranging from mild to severe. None of
   the affected patients reported vestibular complaints, and routine blood
   tests showed normal platelet counts. Whole-exome sequencing (WES)
   revealed a novel frameshift variation, c.3555delA (p.Gln1185Hisfs*3), in
   exon 26 of the DIAPH1 gene. This variation co-segregated with the
   hearing-impaired phenotype in the family. The data collected support the
   classification of c.3555delA as a genetic etiology of hereditary hearing
   loss according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics
   guidelines. Conclusion: We identified a novel pathogenic mutation in the
   DIAPH1 gene, thereby expanding the mutation spectrum associated with
   hearing loss.

AB The key to strengthening the inherent safety of large public spaces and
   implementing precise preventive measures lies in clarifying the
   transmission risks of respiratory infectious diseases based on multiple
   factors. This work innovatively improves a pathogen inhalation infection
   risk prediction model and attempts to apply it to a Fangcang Shelter
   Hospital to investigate the effect of pathogen release location on risk
   distribution and the role of airflow distribution in risk control
   mechanisms. The model used in the study improved in resolution and
   accuracy, shedding light on the airflow distribution mechanisms involved
   in pathogen transport and risk control, thus providing a quantitatively
   realistic landscape of the spread of respiratory infectious diseases in
   large indoor environments. Predictions reveal a significant unevenness
   in the spatial distribution of infection probabilities within the
   multi-patient shelter unit, which is further exacerbated by different
   release locations, and that extreme infection risks can reach 4 to 14
   times the average. Additionally, the study noted that the infection
   probability in the medical staff area due to the long-distance
   transmission of contaminants can reach as high as 1.72 % and that
   patients from ward 6# could potentially infect a healthcare worker every
   four days.

AB Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is one of the notorious bacteria
   responsible for community and hospital infections. It can attach to the
   indwelling medical devices to form biofilms, which increases resistance
   to antibiotics and causes frequent chronic or persistent infections.
   This study attempted to determine the contribution and mechanism between
   the efflux pump norB gene and biofilm development in S . aureus. The
   expression levels of norB gene were detected by quantitative real-time
   polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The norB gene knockout strain
   USA300 Delta norB was constructed by homologous recombination
   technology. Crystal violet staining was utilized to detect the biofilm
   formation ability. Differentially expressed genes between norB knockout
   strains and wild-type strains were screened by RNA-Seq technology and
   verified by qRT-PCR. In comparison to strains with weak biofilm
   development capacity, higher expression levels of the norB gene were
   detected in S. aureus strains that showed strong biofilm forming
   capabilities. The expression levels of norB were significantly
   up-regulated in biofilm bacteria in comparison to planktonic bacteria.
   The knockout of norB gene reduced the biofilm formation ability in S.
   aureus. The deletion of norB gene up-regulated the expression of genes
   related to biofilm formation including agrD, sdrC, sdrD, agrB, agrC,
   fnbB, nuc, lytS, lrgA, sdrE, agrA and saeS, and down-regulated the
   expression of genes related to biofilm formation including clfA, icaR,
   sarA and rot. In conclusion, the efflux pump norB gene serves as a
   crucial role in the production of biofilm, thus rendering it a promising
   avenue for biofilm suppression.

AB BackgroundRobotic ultrasound visualises internal organs in real-time for
   various medical applications without the harm of X-rays. The ultrasound
   probe is attached to the robot's end effector using custom-developed
   probe holders. This paper analyzes the impact of different probe holder
   geometries on the robot's base placement and reachability.MethodsWe
   propose a method to improve probe holder geometries and robot base
   placements to enhance reachability, validated using a 7-DoF serial
   manipulator (KUKA iiwa 7) for ultrasound scans of multiple subcutaneous
   body parts.ResultsWithout additional space restrictions, the number of
   robot base positions with high reachability could be strongly increased
   with an improved probe holder geometry. Under space constraints,
   previously unreachable target poses became accessible by adapting the
   probe holder geometry.ConclusionsOur method provides an automated
   solution for determining improved probe holder geometries, enhancing
   reachability to target areas, especially when the robot's placing area
   is limited.

AB Objective: The resurgence of syphilis in the United States presents a
   significant public health challenge. Much of the information needed for
   syphilis surveillance resides in electronic health records (EHRs). In
   this manuscript, we describe a surveillance platform for automating the
   extraction of EHR data, known as SmartChart Suite, and the results from
   a pilot.
   Materials and Methods: The SmartChart Suite framework has been developed
   in compliance with the HHS Health IT Alignment Policy. The platform's
   major functionalities are (1) data retrieval; (2) logical evaluation;
   (3) standardized data storage; and (4) results display. The SmartChart
   Suite was deployed in September 2023 at the Grady Health System in
   Atlanta, Georgia. We established a cohort of likely syphilis patients,
   randomly selected 50 medical records for manual and automated chart
   review, and analyzed the results.
   Results: The SmartChart Suite was successfully deployed and integrated
   with the Epic EHR system at Grady. The overall performance results were
   precision of 97.6%, recall of 100.0%, and F-Score of 98.8.
   Discussion: Automated abstraction of EHR data has significant potential
   to improve public health surveillance and case investigation processes
   while reducing the resource burden on health departments and reporters.
   The SmartChart Suite comprises a flexible open-source solution for
   registry development and maintenance across a wide spectrum of
   conditions and use cases.
   Conclusion: SmartChart Suite demonstrates the potential of automated
   chart abstraction to support disease surveillance. HHS-compliant
   open-source tools such as SmartChart Suite can support more efficient
   human review by providing accurate and relevant data for critical public
   health activities.

AB Dry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease with a complex
   pathophysiology. The associated morbidity is a worldwide public health
   problem. The development of autologous serum-based eye drops is an
   interesting treatment but presents some constraints. This is a
   retrospective, observational, single-center study of 43 patients (73
   eyes) treated with autologous serum-based eye drops for dry eye syndrome
   at the University Hospital of Caen between 2014 and 2023. The patients'
   subjective symptoms, as well as the various modalities of evaluation of
   their daily quality of life were collected using questionnaires inspired
   by the OSDI questionnaire. The other elements used in this study were
   reported from the patients' medical files. We observed a mean
   improvement in quality of life of 44% in the treated subjects. Quality
   of life correlates with the improvement in the subject's quality of life
   score and overall health (P < 0.01) but, nevertheless, depends on the
   severity of the initial clinical damage and the presence or absence of a
   corneal ulcer (P = 0.013). We also found a reduction in the number of
   daily drops (65.4%) and an improvement in daily activities (85.1%). This
   study's results are consistent with previous work reporting the efficacy
   of autologous serum on the quality of life of treated patients.
   Consideration of the patient as a whole, integrating quality of life
   assessment with clinical examination, is essential when dealing with dry
   eye and its innovative therapeutics. (c) 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

AB BACKGROUND: The differentiation between association and causation is a
   significant challenge in medical research, often further complicated by
   cognitive biases that erroneously interpret coincidental observational
   data as indicative of causality. Such misinterpretations can lead to
   misguided clinical guidelines and healthcare practice, potentially
   endangering patient safety and leading to inefficient use of resources.
   METHODS: We conducted an extensive search of PubMed, Cochrane, and
   Embase databases up to March 2024, identifying circumstances where
   associations from observational studies were incorrectly deemed causal.
   These instances led to changes in clinical practice, embodying what we
   have termed the 'observational interpretation fallacy'.
   RESULTS: Our search identified 16 notable cases where observational
   study-derived associations, initially thought to influence clinical
   practices and guidelines positively, were later contradicted by findings
   from randomised controlled trials or further studies, necessitating
   significant revisions in clinical practice.
   CONCLUSION: In many cases, misinterpretation of observational finding
   negatively affecting patient care and public health policies. Addressing
   and rectifying the observational interpretation fallacy is crucial for
   the progression of medical research and the maintenance of safe and
   effective clinical practice. It is imperative for health policymakers,
   clinicians, and the lay public to critically assess research outcomes
   and make health-related decisions based on a foundation of
   evidence-based medicine. This approach ensures the alignment of medical
   practices with the most current and robust scientific evidence,
   safeguarding patient welfare and optimising resource allocation.

AB The ability to share Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the right
   people plays a crucial role in providing on-time diagnosis. The
   outsourcing of private health data on the cloud, with negligible control
   in the hands of the data owners, poses a significant challenge for
   e-healthcare applications. Obtaining the owner's consent is not just
   essential for data sharing but also to protect the privacy of the data
   being shared. With the help of Blockchain and Interplanetary File System
   (IPFS), this research paper proposes a purpose-based framework for
   obtaining dynamic consent before sharing data among healthcare
   providers, academicians, etc. The study develops a blockchain system on
   the Ethereum network to store encrypted EHRs on IPFS. This architecture
   allows for secure and privacy-enhanced data sharing. The proposed model
   demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing data security, privacy,
   scalability, ownership, and integrity of medical records. The cost
   analysis shows a negligible contract deployment cost of 0.00174363 ETH,
   equivalent to $2.78. The framework presents a viable solution for
   securing EHRs and obtaining dynamic consent, ensuring improved
   healthcare data management. The use of blockchain and IPFS offers a
   promising avenue for enhancing data security and privacy in e-healthcare
   applications.

AB The susceptibility of the human Red Blood Cells (RBCs) under the action
   of magnetic fields, either serves as a biomarker in medical tests, e.g..
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance,
   Magnetoencephalography, or it is used in diagnostic and therapeutical
   processes, e.g.. magnetophoresis for cell sorting. In the present
   manuscript we provide analytical expressions for the magnetic potential
   and the magnetic field strength vector, when a magnetic field is applied
   to a RBC, modeled as a two-layered inverted spheroid. We introduce this
   way in the model the biconcave shape of the RBC and its structure
   (membrane and cytocol) in a more realistic representation, as until now,
   the RBC's shape was considered either as a sphere or a spheroid. The
   solution inside the RBC is obtained in R-separable form in terms of
   Legendre functions of the first and of the second kind and cyclic
   trigonometric functions, by applying appropriate boundary conditions on
   each layer. Our results reveal a non-uniform magnetic field inside the
   RBC. Parametric study of the solution, for various values of the
   physical properties of the RBC, is also provided, demonstrating the
   diamagnetic or the paramagnetic property of the RBC, which is strongly
   related to the health condition of the blood. The obtained solution may
   also serve for the justification of experimental results.

AB BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding metabolic alterations associated with
   maternal antenatal depression (AD) is limited, and their role as
   potential biomarkers that improve the prediction of AD and adverse
   childbirth, neurodevelopmental, and mental health outcomes remains
   unexplored.
   METHODS: In a cohort of 331 mother-child dyads, we studied associations
   between AD (a history of medical register diagnoses and/or a Center for
   Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale score during pregnancy ≥ 20)
   and 95 metabolic measures analyzed 3 times during pregnancy. We tested
   whether the AD-related metabolic measures increased variance explained
   in AD over its risk factors and in childbirth, neurodevelopmental, and
   mental health outcomes over AD. We replicated the findings in a cohort
   of 416 mother-child dyads.
   RESULTS: Elastic net regression identified 15 metabolic measures that
   collectively explained 25% (p < .0001) of the variance in AD, including
   amino and fatty acids, glucose, inflammation, and lipids. These
   metabolic measures increased the variance explained in AD over its risk
   factors (32.3%, p < .0001 vs. 12.6%, p= .004) and in child gestational
   age (9.0%, p < .0001 vs. 0.7%, p= .34), birth weight (9.0%, p= .03 vs.
   0.7%, p= .33), developmental milestones at the age of 2.3 to 5.7 years
   (21.0%, p= .002 vs. 11.6%, p < .001), and any mental or behavioral
   disorder by the age of 13.1 to 16.8 years (25.2%, p= .03 vs. 5.0%, p=
   .11) over AD, child sex, and age. These findings were replicated in the
   independent cohort.
   CONCLUSIONS: AD was associated with alterations in 15 metabolic
   measures, which collectively improved the prediction of AD over its risk
   factors and birth, neurodevelopmental, and mental health outcomes in
   children over AD. These metabolic measures may become biomarkers that
   can be used to identify at-risk mothers and children for personalized
   interventions.

AB BackgroundEmergency medicine (EM) residents must complete both adult and
   paediatric entrustable professional activities (EPAs). During their
   paediatric emergency medicine rotation at a university paediatric
   hospital, EM residents struggled to receive EPA assessments because
   preceptors had not yet been trained due to the stepwise implementation
   of EPAs. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a workshop on
   behaviour change by measuring the number of EPA assessments.MethodsA
   comparative pretraining and posttraining study involving 27 invited
   faculty members was conducted to assess the impact of a faculty
   development programme. The training was delivered via videoconference
   with experiential learning techniques to practise every aspect of the
   supervision of an EPA, including selecting the appropriate EPA according
   to mirroring real-world situations, giving feedback, evaluating autonomy
   and recording the EPA in the resident's logbook.Results/FindingsIn
   total, 20 out of 27 eligible faculty members (74%) agreed to participate
   in the study. Their main challenges reported were a lack of trainee
   initiative, preceptor training and competence in supervising EPAs. Over
   the 12-month analysis period, the enrolled faculty assessed 125 EPAs for
   38 EM residents, including 52 pre-intervention EPAs and 73
   post-intervention EPAs. Calculation of data points above the median
   showed a 1-point difference in the EPAs assessments to resident ratio
   between the pre- and post-intervention periods (3/7 vs.
   4/7).ConclusionOur findings suggest that faculty training using multiple
   educational strategies may enable EM residents to receive more EPA
   assessments during their paediatric emergency medicine rotation.

AB Self-study is essential for student learning, and active learning
   methods aim to facilitate constructive self-study time usage. How active
   learning strategies actually affect student self-study in medical
   education, however, remains partly unknown. The aim of this study was to
   examine medical students' use of self-study time in a longitudinal
   integrated clerkship employing active learning strategies. Week-long
   time logs were used to collect quantitative data on students' scholastic
   activities. Furthermore, semistructured individual interviews were
   conducted for in-depth exploration of different learning activities'
   influence on students' self-study behaviour. Preparation for and
   follow-up work after scheduled learning activities were specifically
   addressed. Students spent on average 42.1 h per week on educational
   activities, of which self-study comprised 23 h. Preparation for upcoming
   learning activities was highly prioritized by the students. Team-based
   learning (TBL) generated most self-study hours, closely followed by
   patient encounters, while problem-based learning (PBL) induced least
   amounts of self-study. 50% of self-study time was done without specific
   relation to scheduled learning activities. Active learning methods
   appear to promote preparatory work, in accordance with their pedagogic
   theory. Type of learning activity appears to be decisive in determining
   the amount of self-study students choose to undertake. Future research
   should address how quantity and content of different learning activities
   influence self-study behaviour.

AB Peer review is the cornerstone of academic publishing that upholds the
   quality and integrity of scholarly work. However, there is an
   ever-growing struggle to recruit peer reviewers, termed the 'peer review
   crisis', driven by a shrinking academic workforce and increased
   workload. Additionally, there is a notable lack of standardised training
   for peer reviewers which poses a challenge in maintaining high-quality
   reviews. In this 'How to & mldr;' paper, we demonstrate the feasibility
   and benefits of establishing a community of practice (CoP) aimed at
   fostering professional development among multiprofessional early-career
   scholars in health professions education. A CoP is structured around
   three core components: domain, community and practice. This community's
   domain focuses on recruiting scholars with a shared interest in health
   professions education, research and peer review. The community's
   component promotes inclusive and regular interactions through
   synchronous meetings and asynchronous communication, encouraging
   engagement, mutual learning and collaboration among diverse
   participants. Practice is cultivated through peer-led teaching sessions
   and the use of digital platforms, enabling participants to build peer
   review competencies collaboratively. Based on our experience as
   participants in the Association for the Studies of Medical Education
   (ASME) and The Clinical Teacher (TCT) awarded programme of professional
   development in educational research and peer review, we propose that
   this model may help other institutional health professions education
   groups and journals adopt similar practices. Providing early-career
   scholars with opportunities to develop academic skills will not only
   help create a sustainable, high-quality pool of peer reviewers but also
   cultivate a more inclusive and skilled scholarly community.

AB Recognizing and prioritizing research areas in emergency care is crucial
   for generating evidence and advancing research programs, aiming to
   enhance health outcomes for both individuals and populations. The
   objective of this review is to document global clinical and nonclinical
   research priorities. The Emergency Medicine Education and Research by
   Global Experts network, consisting of 22 sites across six continents,
   conducted a mapping review of publications on emergency medicine
   research priorities (2000-2022) across seven databases. We included
   studies with replicable methodologies for determining research
   priorities, excluding those limited to individual diseases. Three
   reviewers independently screened, selected, and categorized results into
   clinical and nonclinical topics. Discrepancies were resolved by an
   independent investigator and consensus. Outcomes measures and analysis
   include descriptive analysis of research priorities grouped into
   clinical and nonclinical topics, characteristics of publications
   including countries represented in the author list, target audience
   (such as researchers or policy makers), participants (e.g. patients),
   and methods (e.g. Delphi) of priority setting. Among 968 screened
   papers, 57 publications from all WHO regions were included. Most (36,
   63%) had authors from only a single country, primarily in North America
   and Europe. Patient representatives were included in only 10 (18%).
   Clinical research priorities clustered into resuscitation, cardiology,
   central nervous system, emergency medical services, infectious disease,
   mental health, respiratory disease, and trauma. Distribution was broad
   in North America and Europe but focused on infectious diseases and
   resuscitation in Africa and Asia. Eleven nonclinical topics included
   access to care, health policy, screening/triage, social determinants of
   health, staffing, technology/simulation, shared decision making,
   cross-sectoral collaboration, education, patient-centered care, and
   research networks. Nonclinical topics were broad in Europe and America,
   focused on access to care and health screening in Africa, and mostly
   absent in other WHO regions. Published research priorities in emergency
   medicine are heterogeneous and geographically limited, mostly containing
   groups of authors from the same country. The majority of publications in
   global research priority setting stem from Western countries, covering a
   broad spectrum of clinical and nonclinical topics. Research priorities
   from Africa and Asia tend to focus on specific issues more prevalent in
   those regions of the world.

AB BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Prolonged emergency medical services'
   response times (EMS-RT) are associated with poorer outcomes in
   out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The patient access time interval
   (PATI), from vehicle stop until contact with patient, may be increased
   in areas with low socioeconomic status (SES).
   OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to identify predictors of
   prolonged EMS-RT intervals, and to evaluate associations with clinical
   outcomes in OHCAs occurring in the largest metropolitan area in France.
   DESIGN: Using the Utstein-style, prospectively implemented,
   population-based SDEC registry for OHCAs, we conducted a multicenter,
   region-wide, retrospective cohort study of EMS dispatches for OHCA cases
   occurring in the 124 cities of the Greater Paris area, France, between
   January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2018.
   SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: Adult, nontraumatic, EMS-assessed, non-EMS
   witnessed OHCAs.
   EXPOSURE: Geographic location and scene-level SES.
   OUTCOME MEASURES AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was the EMS-RT
   interval, from activation until arrival at patient's side. As secondary
   outcomes, we evaluated patient access outcomes of: (1)
   dispatch-to-patient contact interval ('EMS-RT'); and (2) vehicle scene
   arrival-to-patient contact interval (PATI); and patient clinical
   outcomes of: (1) death; and (2) unfavorable neurological status, both at
   30 days. Area-level SES was assessed at census tract level using the
   European Deprivation Index (EDI; continuous, and divided into quintiles,
   Q5 = most deprived). We fitted multilevel mixed-effects regression
   models to identify predictors of patient access outcomes, and their
   association with clinical outcomes.
   MAIN RESULTS: We included 4082 cases; the median EMS-RT was 10.85 min
   (interquartile range [8.87-13.15]), and 138 (3.4%) survived to hospital
   discharge. Independent predictors of increased EMS-RT and PATI were age
   >65, female sex, residential location, occurrence at elevated floors,
   arrest unwitnessed by a bystander, and low EDI (all P < 0.018). After
   multivariable analysis, an overall EMS-RT interval >8 min was associated
   with higher mortality and poorer neurological status at hospital
   discharge (both P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: In OHCA cases occurring in the Greater Paris metropolitan
   area, after adjustment for scene characteristics, EMS delays until
   patient contact were longer in neighborhoods of low SES, and were
   associated with poorer clinical outcomes.

AB Patients admitted to Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI) have their
   non-medical needs provided by caregivers called "attendants" who are
   predominantly female family members. This provides a unique opportunity
   to provide free screening among attendants during their free time at the
   hospital. The objective of this qualitative focus group study was to
   understand knowledge of and facilitators and barriers to cervical cancer
   screening among attendants at the UCI. The goal is to use these data to
   inform a future opportunistic intervention. Female attendants 25 years
   of age or older were included in this focus group study. The focus group
   discussions explored knowledge of cervical cancer and screening
   modalities, health information sources, barriers and facilitators for
   cervical cancer screening, and potential use of mobile phone technology
   to share cervical cancer screening information among one's social
   community. Data were analyzed using an inductive approach and thematic
   analysis. Results showed moderate understanding of risk factors for
   cervical cancer, supplemented by misinformation. Knowledge of symptoms
   of advanced cervical cancer was high. Most participants were aware that
   cervical cancer screening exists but knew little about screening
   modalities. Responses were mixed regarding preferred information
   sources, and included healthcare workers and facilities, radio and
   family members. Participants were enthusiastic about mobile phone
   messaging to provide information about screening but emphasized a need
   to catch their attention and incentivize screening with promise of good
   such as sugar, demonstrating prioritization of immediate needs over
   future cancer risk. These results will inform an intervention which aims
   to connect female caregivers with free screening available at the
   adjacent cancer prevention clinic.

AB AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Approximately 50% of Americans report having low
   health insurance literacy, leading to uncertainty when choosing their
   insurance coverage to best meet their healthcare needs. Therefore, we
   aimed to evaluate the association between lack of prescription drug
   benefit knowledge and problems paying medical bills among Medicare
   beneficiaries.
   METHODS: We analysed the 2021 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey Public
   Use File of 5586 Medicare beneficiaries aged ≥65 years. The binary
   dependent variable was whether beneficiaries had problems paying medical
   bills in the past year. The categorical independent variable was how
   much beneficiaries knew about the Medicare prescription drug benefit. A
   survey-weighted multivariable logit model, adjusted for covariates
   (e.g., socio-demographics, comorbidities, private insurance coverage,
   and satisfaction with out-of-pocket costs), was conducted to examine the
   association between the independent variable and problems paying medical
   bills.
   RESULTS: Approximately 4.3% of study beneficiaries (~2.0 million
   beneficiaries) reported problems paying medical bills. Of those without
   and with problems paying medical bills, 27.7% and 39.6%, respectively,
   reported knowing little/almost nothing about prescription drug benefits.
   Beneficiaries aged 65-74 years (marginal effect [ME]=2.1%, p<0.01), with
   comorbidities (e.g., ≥4 conditions, ME=3.8%, p<0.001), dissatisfaction
   with out-of-pocket costs (ME=10.1%, p<0.001), without private insurance
   (e.g., employer-sponsored insurance, ME=2.5%, p<0.01), or with
   little/almost no knowledge of prescription drug benefits (ME=1.9%,
   p<0.05) were more likely to report problems paying medical bills
   compared to their counterparts.
   CONCLUSION: Tailored programmes aimed at improving beneficiaries'
   knowledge of prescription drug benefits, reducing out-of-pocket costs
   and preventing comorbidities may be considered for the at-risk
   population to address the problem.

AB INTRO: The article tests the hypothesis that we can draw practical
   knowledge from the experience of service providers operating in the
   past. The research questions were formulated: can the historical example
   of the organization of medical care in the Polish Children's Hospital
   named after Karol and Maria be used as a viable example today? Is it
   relevant for contemporary practitioners? And do we still use the
   knowledge of predecessors? The authors decided to use the interwar
   Hospital and an operating paediatric ward of the Child-Friendly Hospital
   for a comparative analysis.
   METHODS: The model of the European Regional Office of the World Health
   Organization for integrated delivery of health services was adopted as
   the analysis framework. We based the analysis on descriptive methods,
   starting with a literature review of routine activities of the Karol and
   Maria Hospital (historical example) and a paediatric hospital in Poland
   (contemporary example), then we conducted a comparative transversal
   study concerning the extent to which integrated care occurs in the WHO
   model. Finally, the elements of the process evaluation were used in the
   work.
   RESULTS: The research model used enabled us to provide answers to the
   research questions formulated. The comparative study of a historical
   hospital and a contemporary one has shown that some problems and ways of
   solving them constantly reappear in the discussion on the management of
   evidence-based medical care. Sourcing good practices from the past can
   be a good research method for current practitioners.
   CONCLUSION: It seems that while the technical aspects of integrated care
   initiated in the past are developing perfectly, the approach to the
   evidence-based medicine is waiting to be developed again.

AB Background and ObjectivesCisgender women with epilepsy (WWE) have
   distinct reproductive health needs. It is unknown to what extent WWE and
   their health care providers (HCPs) are aware of recent research advances
   regarding the reproductive health of WWE. This study aimed to survey US
   health care providers and WWE about their knowledge, attitudes, and
   decision-making pertaining to reproductive health; their awareness of
   key findings from recent relevant research; and whether learning of
   these findings would change their decision-making.MethodsA market
   research firm conducted an online survey of US health care providers and
   WWE using a proprietary nationally representative panel. Eligible HCPs
   included physicians and advance practice providers in neurology,
   obstetrics-gynecology, and primary care, who treat WWE. Eligible WWE
   were 18-45 years old and reported an epilepsy diagnosis and taking
   antiseizure medication. Data were analyzed through descriptive
   statistics and logistic regression.ResultsFour hundred one HCPs and 199
   WWE completed the full survey. Among HCPs, 38% reported being very or
   extremely comfortable treating pregnant WWE. Seventy-nine percent of
   HCPs reported that recent relevant research findings were new to them,
   with 65% reporting that the findings seemed plausible and 49% reporting
   that the findings would probably or definitely change their management
   of pregnancy for WWE.Thirty percent of WWE reported that pregnancy is

   that research findings were new to them, 37% reported that the findings
   seemed plausible, and 64% reported that the findings would probably or
   definitely influence their reproductive decision-making.DiscussionSurvey
   findings suggest suboptimal awareness of recent research advances
   pertaining to the reproductive health of WWE among WWE and their HCPs.
   Findings also suggest that dissemination and implementation of such
   findings may be impactful on the medical decision-making of both HCPs
   and WWE. Findings may guide future initiatives to ensure prompt
   dissemination and implementation of research advances in epilepsy and
   reproductive health.

AB OBJECTIVE: There are significant difficulties associated with the
   management of dementia patients in hospitals, leading to adverse patient
   outcomes, prolonged length of stay (LOS), strain on resources and high
   readmission rates. This study aimed to investigate these factors in the
   context of a regional hospital.
   DESIGN: This study retrospectively reviewed all dementia admissions in a
   publicly funded Australian regional hospital from January 2022 to
   December 2022.
   METHODS: All admissions including an ICD-10 coded dementia diagnosis
   were assessed, and data extracted using the integrated electronic
   medical record.
   SETTING: Overall, 257 bed Australian regional hospital in an area with a
   Modified Monash Model rating of 2.
   PARTICIPANTS: There were 105 dementia patients admitted within the study
   period.
   MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Dementia severity, LOS, consultation liaison
   (CL) psychiatry involvement, readmission rates, and discharge
   destinations.
   RESULTS: The LOS in patients with dementia was 23.3 (±35.2) days
   compared to age-matched patients without dementia admitted in the same
   period with a LOS of 8.2 (±4.7) days. Dementia patients who died in
   hospital had the longest acute LOS at 14.4 (±8.8) days. Dementia
   patients who were admitted from their usual residential aged care
   facility had the longest maintenance LOS at 69 (±83.3) days.
   CONCLUSIONS: This research contributes information to the current
   knowledge gap of dementia care in regional hospitals. Data from this
   study may help to inform the development of strategies for effective
   hospital-based dementia care and interventions.

AB Background: Surgical site infections (SSI) are the most common
   complication following lower extremity bypass (LEB) surgery. SSIs
   contribute to significant patient morbidity and healthcare expenditure,
   and accurate detection of SSIs remains an important step in reduction
   efforts. In this study, we aimed to characterize early-onset SSIs among
   patients undergoing LEB surgery. Methods: Institutional medical records
   were retrospectively queried for all LEB operations performed across 3
   hospitals from 2018 to 2022. All SSIs within a 90-day postoperative
   period were included, per CDC definition, and categorized as early-
   (within 7 days of operation), standard- (8- 30 days), or delayed-onset
   (31-90 days). The Southampton grading scale was used to stratify the
   severity of infection (grade 2, erythema; grade 3, erythema with serous
   drainage; grade 4; erythema with purulent drainage; or grade 5, severe
   wound necrosis). Data were analyzed using univariate tests and logistic
   regression analysis. Results: A total of 517 LEB operations were
   performed over the 5-year study period. Median follow-up period was 18.5
   months. Early-, standard-, and delayed-onset SSIs were diagnosed in 2.9%
   (n- 15), 15.1% (n- 78), and 4.6% (n- 24) of the patients, respectively.
   Compared with standard- and delayed-onset groups, patients with
   early-onset SSIs were more frequently nonsmokers (26.7% vs. 3.9% vs.
   8.3%, P- 0.03) and had lower prevalence of comorbidities. Early-onset
   SSIs most frequently presented as Southampton grade 2 (60.0%) or grade 5
   (20.0%) infections, whereas standard- and delayed-onset SSIs were more
   evenly distributed among grade 2 (30.4%), grade 3 (41.2%), and grade 4
   (21.6%) presentations (P- 0.002). The most commonly isolated organisms
   among the early-onset SSI group were Gram-negative rods (20.0%). In
   comparison, polymicrobial infections (19.6%) and Gram-positive cocci
   (14.7%) were most common among standard- and delayed-onset groups (P-
   0.04). The early-onset SSI group experienced a longer index
   hospitalization (11 vs. 6 vs. 8 days, P- 0.02) and lower 30-day
   readmission rates (13.3% vs. 59.0% vs. 45.8%, P- 0.005) compared with
   standard- and delayed- onset groups. On multivariate analysis, active
   smoking (hazard ratio [HR] 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI],
   0.02-0.98, P- 0.035), former smoking (HR 0.08, 95% CI, 0.01-0.71, P-
   0.02), coronary artery disease (HR 0.15, 95% CI, 0.03-0.83, P- 0.03),
   and hypertension (HR 0.13, 95% CI, 0.03-0.68, P- 0.02) were associated
   with a lower risk of early-onset infection, when compared with patients
   suffering standard- and delayed-onset SSIs. Conclusions: Early-onset
   SSIs after LEB surgery have a distinct clinical presentation, impact
   healthier patients, and are associated with more virulent organisms
   compared with standard- and delayed-onset SSIs.

   areas: diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) based on clinical
   history, behavioral, and eye-tracking data; diagnosis of multiple
   disorders based on conversational data; and medication selection based
   on clinical history and genetic data. We found five scientific articles
   evaluating the devices' performance and external validity. The average
   completeness of reporting, indicated by 52 % adherence to the
   Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Artificial Intelligence
   (CONSORT-AI) checklist, was modest, signaling room for improvement in

AB Automated brain tumor recognition is crucial for swift diagnosis and
   treatment in healthcare, enhancing patient survival rates but manual
   recognition of tumor types is time-consuming and resource-intensive.
   Over the past few years, researchers have proposed various Deep Learning
   (DL) methods to automate the recognition process over the past years.
   However, these approaches often lack convincing accuracy and rely on
   datasets consisting of limited samples, raising concerns regarding
   real-world efficacy and reliability. Furthermore, the decisions made by
   black-box AI models in healthcare, where lives are at stake, require
   proper decision explainability. To address these issues, we propose a
   robust and explainable deep CNN-based method for effective recognition
   of brain tumor types, attaining state-of-the-art accuracies of 99.81%,
   99.55%, and 99.30% on the training, validation, and test sets,
   respectively, surpassing both the previous works and baseline models.
   Moreover, we employed three Explainable AI techniques: Grad-CAM,
   Grad-CAM++, and Score-CAM for explainability analysis, contributing
   towards the development of trustworthy and reliable automation of
   healthcare diagnosis.

AB DMSNet, a novel model for medical image segmentation is proposed in this
   research work. DMSNet employs a dual multi-scale architecture, combining
   the computational efficiency of EfficientNet B5 with the contextual
   understanding of the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT). Integration of a
   multi-scale module in both encoders enhances the model's capacity to
   capture intricate details across various resolutions, enabling precise
   delineation of complex foreground boundaries. Notably, DMSNet
   incorporates contrastive learning with a novel pixel-wise contrastive
   loss function during training, contributing to heightened segmentation
   accuracy and improved generalization capabilities. The model's
   performance is demonstrated through experimental evaluation on the four
   diverse datasets including Brain tumor segmentation (BraTS 2020),
   Diabetic Foot ulcer segmentation (DFU), Polyps (KVASIR-SEG) and Breast
   cancer segmentation (BCSS). We have employed recently introduced metrics
   to evaluate and compare our model with other state-of-the-art
   architectures. By advancing segmentation accuracy through innovative
   architectural design, multi-scale modules, and contrastive learning
   techniques, DMSNet represents a significant stride in the field, with
   potential implications for improved patient care and outcomes.

AB Purpose. - To identify the skills and personality profiles that are most
   expected by ophthalmology patients and to help ophthalmologists and
   ophthalmology residents improve their communication with patients and
   thus their quality of care. Methods. - This prospective, single-center
   study was carried out from November 2nd, 2020, to participated in the
   study. We created a French-language questionnaire including 16 physician
   qualities identified in the literature and 18 qualities drawn from
   Process-Communication (c) Model profiles. Results. - For the 784
   patients meeting inclusion criteria and successfully completing the
   questionnaire, 60% (n = 470) were female and 40% (n = 314) male, with a
   mean and median age of 47 years. The most frequently chosen criteria are
   those relating to communication (mean score 4.45 f 0.90 out of 5).
   Organizational qualities were also frequently chosen (3.83 f 1.23).
   Respondents somewhat frequently selected both human qualities (3.72 f
   1.55) and theoretical and practical skills (3.71 f 1.42). Patients
   preferred a conscientious (n = 611, 13%), responsible (n = 519, 11.05%),
   and reflective (n = 491, 10.50%) ophthalmologist. The most chosen
   Process- Communication Model profiles were persister (n = 737, 94%),
   thinker (n = 729, 93%) and imaginer (n = 680, 87%). Conclusion. -
   According to patients, the ideal profile of an ophthalmologist is
   primarily a good communicator, as well as competent and humble. This
   study will help physicians to better meet patient demands and might also
   improve the training of ophthalmologists.

AB Electrochemical sensors are emerging as promising tools for
   point-of-care diagnostic medical devices, benefiting from advancements
   in nanomaterials. These nanomaterials enable the development of smaller,
   more sensitive, and selective sensors while reducing fabrication and
   maintenance costs. This work presents a comprehensive theoretical
   investigation of the potential application of pristine, Ga- and Al-doped
   Zn12O12 nanoclusters for detecting methadone, a critical analyte in
   various medical and law enforcement applications. Employing density
   functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP-D level with the 6-311
   G (d, p) basis set, we have elucidated the interactions between these
   nanoclusters and methadone. The results reveal that methadone exhibits
   intense adsorption energies of -41.02, -39.79, and -59.77 kcal/mol on
   the pristine Zn12O12, GaZn11O12, and AlZn11O12 nanoclusters,
   respectively, in their most stable configurations. The doped
   nanoclusters, GaZn11O12 and AlZn11O12, displayed significant gap
   energies (Eg) changes upon methadone adsorption, indicating enhanced
   sensitivity towards this analyte. The UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis
   showed that methadone adsorption on the GaZn11O12 and AlZn11O12
   nanoclusters led to distinct spectral shifts and oscillator strength
   variations compared to the Zn12O12 nanocluster. The transition theory
   calculations highlighted the GaZn11O12 nanocluster's short recovery time
   of 0.44 s, a crucial attribute for practical applications. Solvent
   effect studies demonstrated the stability of the methadone/GaZn11O12
   complex in water and revealed its heightened polarization, as evidenced
   by the increased dipole moment. These findings suggest that the
   GaZn11O12 nanocluster is a promising candidate for detecting methadone
   in gas and liquid phases, with favorable attributes such as high
   sensitivity, rapid reversibility, and stability in gas and aqueous
   environments. Thus, this nanocluster can be used in sensor devices.

   = 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mol%, were synthesized using the melt-quench method.
   The effects of Fe2O3 on the structural, physical, optical, and radiation
   shielding capacity of glasses samples were studied. X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) measurements verified the amorphous nature of the prepared
   samples. The density (rho) increased from 4.54 to 4.87 g/cm3, while the
   molar volume (Vm) declined from 30.01 to 29.68 cm3/mol. The conversion
   of [BO3] to [BO4] groups brought on by an increase in non-bridging
   oxygens (NBOs) inside the glass structure is the reason for improving
   density. The direct optical ( E Directg ) ranged from 3.284 eV to 3.085
   eV and the indirect optical ( E Indirect g ) band changed from 2.905 eV
   to 2.605 eV. Urbach energy (Eu) and refractive index were increased with
   increasing Fe2O3 content. The energy of the single oscillator (Eo)
   decreased from 4.183 eV to 3.381 eV. The sample TSLBLF8 possessed the
   highest values of mass (MAC) and linear (LAC) attenuation coefficients,
   but lowest values of half (HVL) value layer and mean (MFP) free path
   among all studied samples. Therefore, the TSLBLF8 glass has higher
   shielding characteristics. Therefore, glasses can be used in
   opt-electronic and medical applications.

AB Linear accelerator (LINAC) stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a
   specialised treatment used for various brain conditions, including
   arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This paper investigates the
   obliteration rate of AVMs treated by the LINAC-based facility at Prince
   of Wales Hospital, defines factors influencing obliteration rate, time
   to obliteration and complications post-SRS. A retrospective audit review
   of patient notes sourced from electronic medical records was conducted.
   During the study period 219 patients received treatment, of which the
   final status of 136 AVMs was known. Overall obliteration rate was 75.7
   %, with obliteration rates of 5 %, 30 % and 46 % at one, three and four
   years, respectively. Post analysis, a radiosurgery dose of > 18 Gray
   (Gy) was predictive of achieving obliteration (Odds Ratio (OR) 4.2, 95 %
   Confidence Interval (CI) 1.61-10.83, p = 0.003) whilst a nidus size of
   3-6 cm was less likely of achieving obliteration (OR 0.2, CI 0.10-0.57,
   p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed a radiosurgery dose of > 18 Gy
   remained predictive (OR 4.7, CI 1.69-13.25, p = 0.003) and a nidus size
   of 3-6 cm remained less likely to achieve obliteration (OR 0.2, CI
   0.10-0.57, p = 0.001). Females were predictive of developing temporary
   complications post-SRS in multivariate analysis (OR 2.8, CI 1.24-6.13, p
   = 0.013), and having > 1 SRS session was predictive of developing
   permanent complications post-SRS (OR 7.1, CI 2.44-20.53, p < 0.001). The
   obliteration rate achieved from our study and the predictive nature to
   achieve obliteration with a radiosurgery dose of > 18 Gy is comparable
   to existing literature including that using the Gamma-Knife system.

AB IntroductionGPs, at least in the United Kingdom, often run behind
   schedule in their clinics. This lateness is an inherently ethical
   problem due to the negative consequences it generates.MethodsThe paper
   outlines these negative consequences, attempts to classify the major
   reasons for such lateness, explores the ethical status of each of these
   reasons, and offers suggestions for how the negative consequences might
   be managed.Findings and DiscussionThe major reasons for lateness can be
   classified as GP-related, patient-related, and third party-related. The
   major negative consequences of lateness in general practice might be
   classified as the potential disturbance to quality and safe care, the
   dissatisfaction of and inconvenience to subsequent patients, and the
   disruption of timely care. These negative consequences must be burdened
   by some party-either the patient who is related to the reason for the
   lateness, or other patients who are not. While a strict equality
   approach to managing such lateness does not consider patients' clinical
   needs, GPs compensating by actively 'catching up' in their clinics
   threatens quality and safety of care. The paper argues for minimising
   the negative consequences of lateness for all parties, while
   simultaneously promoting equity with regard to patients' clinical needs.
   The ethical status of each major reason for lateness in general practice
   is explored, and suggestions are offered for how each might be managed
   to minimise the negative consequences and promote equity.

   level of education or income were the factors of interest. Pairs of
   independent reviewers selected studies, extracted data, and appraised
   quality of the studies using MMAT-2018. We conducted descriptive and
   content analyses with a narrative synthesis. Results: From 7579
   identified deduped studies, we included 12 with a total of 22266
   participants. Suboptimal interpersonal communication in several domains
   was more incident amongst ethnic minorities (p < 0.01) and individuals
   with lower language proficiency (p < 0.05). Discussion and Conclusion:
   Studies used sex and gender interchangeably. The classifications of
   racial and ethnic origin, income, and education levels were
   inconsistent. Our findings suggest that socioeconomic and demographic
   factors can affect deleteriously in-encounter interpersonal
   communication. Practice Implications: This review might help guide a
   communication curriculum for medical students and increase awareness of
   potential health inequalities pathways in clinical practice.

AB Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a polymer comprised of more than 50%
   chlorine that offers unmatched versatility at low expense. PVC is
   irreplaceable in several applications, such as construction materials,
   medical applications, and cables. This versatility and tunable
   properties come at the cost of complex formulations for the product and
   challenging end-of-life (EoL) options for PVC waste. Pure collected and
   sorted PVC is already recycled successfully to some extent, yet, when
   PVC ends up in a mixed plastic waste stream, it can be detrimental to
   the recycling process. PVC waste and its effects at various
   concentrations remain a focal point for both scholars and policymakers.
   In this review, the narrative begins at the naissance of PVC and
   continues to investigate the EoL valorization options when the products
   are inevitably discarded. Strategies for PVC waste recycling and the
   technical and legal challenges regarding each method are discussed,
   focusing on the European recycling market. An effective solution to
   handle EoL PVC requires a combination of policies and schemes for proper
   collection and sorting of specific waste streams and considering all
   available technologies to select the right tools. This review can
   support appropriate policies and the selection of suitable methods of
   recycling PVC waste.

AB Background: Episiotomy has specific indications that, if properly
   followed, can effectively prevent women from experiencing severe
   lacerations that may result in significant complications like anal
   incontinence. However, the risk factors related to episiotomy has been
   the center of much debate in the medical field in the past few years.
   Objective: The present study used a machine learning model to predict
   the factors that put women at the risk of having episiotomy using
   intrapartum data.
   Study design: This was a retrospective cohort study design. Factors such
   as age, educational level, residency place, medical insurance,
   nationality, attendance at prenatal education courses, parity,
   gestational age, onset of labor, presence of a doula during labor,
   maternal health conditions like anemia, diabetes, preeclampsia,
   prolonged rupture of membrane, placenta abruption, presence of meconium
   in amniotic fluid, intrauterine growth retardation, intrauterine fetal
   death, maternal body mass index, and fetal distress were extracted from
   the electronic health record system of a tertiary-care medical center in
   Iran, from January 2022 to January 2023. The criteria for inclusion were
   vaginal delivery of a single pregnancy. Deliveries done through
   scheduled/emergency cesarean section or at the mother's request were
   excluded. The participants were divided into two groups: those who had
   vaginal deliveries with episiotomy and those who had vaginal deliveries
   without episiotomy. The significant variables, as determined by their
   P-values, were selected as features for the eight machine-learning
   models. The evaluation of performance included area under the curve
   (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score.
   Results: During the study period, out of 1775 vaginal deliveries, 629
   (35.4%) required an episiotomy. Each model had an AUC value assigned to
   it: linear regression (0.85), deep learning (0.82), support vector
   machine (0.79), light gradient-boosting (0.79), logistic regression
   (0.78), XGBoost classification (0.77), random forest classification
   (0.76), decision tree classification (0.75), and permutation
   classification-knn (0.70). Linear regression had a better diagnostic
   performance among all the models with the area under the ROC curve
   (AUC): 0.85, accuracy: 0.80, precision: 0.74, recall: 0.86, and F_1
   score: 0.79). Parity, labor onset, gestational age, body mass index, and
   doula support were the leading clinical factors related to episiotomy,
   according to their importance rankings.
   Conclusions: Utilizing a clinical dataset and various machine learning
   models to assess the risk factors of episiotomy resulted in promising
   results. Further research, focusing on intrapartum clinical data and
   perspectives of the birth attendant, is necessary to enhance the
   accuracy of predictions.

AB BACKGROUND: About 5% to 13% of maternal mortality is directly related to
   unsafe abortion care. Despite the cultural stigmatization of abortions,
   Ghana has progressive abortion laws, healthcare guidelines, and clinical
   outcomes.
   OBJECTIVE: Our study's primary aim was to characterize abortion outcomes
   in Ghana. Our secondary aims included investigating factors that led to
   abortion complications and the treatment of these complications.
   STUDY DESIGN: We used data from the 2017 Ghana Maternal Health Survey.
   We examined questions that focused on the reasons for abortion, methods
   used for abortion, healthcare setting for abortion, and health issues
   after abortion. We performed descriptive and inferential statistics,
   including cross tabulation with chi-square analysis and logistic
   regression models.
   RESULTS: Between 2012 and 2017, 1,425 women reported and completed the
   abortion-related questions. For those who obtained an abortion for
   health reasons, 69% had a surgical-based as opposed to herbal or
   medication-based abortion (P<.001), 94% had a medical facility-based as
   opposed to non-medical facility-based abortion (P<.001), and 21% had
   health problems related to the abortion within 1 month (P=.035). Women's
   reasons for undergoing an abortion did not affect the treatment rates
   after complications. There was no difference in the occurrence of an
   abortion-related complication or receipt of treatment for this
   complication within 1 month after the abortion among those who underwent
   medical facility-based and those who underwent nonmedical facility based
   abortion. Those with tertiary-level education or those who knew
   abortions were legal were more likely to have a surgical and medical
   facility-based abortion.
   CONCLUSION: Although Ghana has room to improve the safety and
   accessibility of abortion services, our analysis suggests abortions in
   Ghana, regardless of reason given for seeking the service or method of
   abortion, seem to be safe. Translating Ghana's approach to abortion
   could minimize unsafe abortions globally.

AB Accurate and efficient bacterial detection is essential for public
   health and medical diagnostics. However, traditional detection methods
   are constrained by limited dataset size, complex bacterial morphology,
   and diverse detection environments, hindering their effectiveness. In
   this study, we present EagleEyeNet, a novel multi-scale information
   fusion model designed to address these challenges. EagleEyeNet leverages
   large models as teacher networks in a knowledge distillation framework,
   significantly improving detection performance. Additionally, a newly
   designed feature fusion architecture, integrating Transformer modules,
   is proposed to enable the efficient fusion of global and multi-scale
   features, overcoming the bottlenecks posed by Feature Pyramid Networks
   (FPN) structures, which in turn reduces information transmission loss
   between feature layers. To improve the model's adaptability for
   different scenarios, we create our own QingDao Bacteria Detection (QDBD)
   dataset as a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for bacterial detection.
   Experimental results demonstrate that EagleEyeNet achieves remarkable
   performance improvements, with mAP50 increases of 3.1% on the QDBD
   dataset and 4.90% on the AGRA dataset, outperforming the
   State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) methods in detection accuracy. These findings
   underscore the transformative potential of integrating large models and
   deep learning for advancing bacterial detection technologies.

AB Artificial intelligence has been widely used in the financial field,
   such as credit risk assessment, fraud detection, and stock prediction.
   Training deep learning models requires a significant amount of data, but
   financial data often contains sensitive information, some of which
   cannot be disclosed. Acquiring large amounts of financial data for
   training deep learning models is a pressing issue that needs to be
   addressed. This paper proposes a Noise Visibility Function-Differential
   Privacy Generative Adversarial Network (NVF-DPGAN) model, which
   generates privacy preserving data similar to the original data, and can
   be applied to data augmentation for deep learning. This study conducts
   experiments using financial data from China Stock Market & Accounting
   Research (CSMAR) database. It compares the generated data with real data
   from various perspectives, including mean, probability density
   distribution, and correlation. The experimental results show that the
   two datasets exhibit similar characteristics. A time series forecasting
   model is trained on the generated data and the real data separately, and
   their prediction results are closely aligned. NVF-DPGAN model is
   feasible and practical in terms of financial data enhancement and
   privacy protection. This method can also be generalized to other fields,
   such as the privacy protection of medical data.

   giant cutaneous neoplasm on the right breast skin of a 36-year-old
   female who was admitted to the Department of Breast Surgery at the
   Affiliated Tumor Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University (Urumqi,
   China). Skin mass excision was performed and histopathology confirmed
   the diagnosis of thoracic plexiform neurofibroma as a primary
   presentation of NF1. The clinical implementation of NF1 therapies
   necessitates meticulous consideration of various factors and should
   involve a multidisciplinary team with expertise in NF1.

AB Trichomonas tenax is predominant in dental caries and is commonly
   observed in patients with oral diseases; however, its presence in
   patients with pleural effusion remains rare. Pleural effusion can arise
   from various causes, including malignant tumors, tuberculosis and
   bacterial infections. Concurrent infections involving bacteria, fungi
   and Trichomonas are infrequent. This scenario is particularly rare in
   patients with tumor-associated Trichomonas tenax infection. The current
   study presents a case of Trichomonas tenax infection in a patient with a
   lung tumor. The patient, a 71-year-old male, experienced symptoms of
   chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughing and expectoration
   following surgery for a right lung tumor. The expectorated sputum was
   white and sticky, making coughing difficult. The patient had a history
   of a prior right lung tumor resection and was subsequently admitted to
   Heping Hospital Affiliated to Changzhi Medical College (Changzhi,
   China). Routine examination of the pleural effusion fluid revealed the
   presence of Trichomonas tenax under a wet-film microscope. Molecular
   sequencing confirmed that the isolate was Trichomonas tenax. This case
   highlights Trichomonas tenax as a potential opportunistic pathogen in
   patients with lung cancer, underscoring the need for heightened clinical
   awareness. This study offers valuable insights for the diagnosis and
   prevention of infectious diseases among patients with cancer in the
   future.

AB The appearance of 'web-like mucus' in the stomach is a novel phenomenon
   associated with vonoprazan (VPZ) usage, characterized by a descriptive
   mucus pattern resembling a spider web or net. The present study aimed to
   determine its prevalence and related factors. In this retrospective
   observational study, the medical records and endoscopic reports of 547
   patients who underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy were reviewed. The
   overall prevalence of web-like mucus was 6% (33/547), with 97% (32/33)
   of these patients being VPZ users. Specifically, 19% (32/167) of VPZ
   users exhibited this web-like mucus pattern, which was significantly
   more prevalent in the VPZ group than in the control (no acid blocker
   intake), proton pump inhibitor, and histamine-2 receptor antagonist
   groups. Multivariate analysis identified that VPZ use was positively
   associated with web-like mucus, while open-type gastric atrophy and
   multiple white and flat elevated lesions were negatively associated. A
   retrospective analysis of endoscopic findings before initiating VPZ
   therapy showed that none of the 32 VPZ users with web-like mucus had
   exhibited the pattern previously. Furthermore, the Cochran-Armitage
   trend test indicated no significant association between the duration of
   VPZ therapy and the prevalence of web-like mucus. In conclusion,
   web-like mucus in the stomach is strongly associated with VPZ use but is
   not associated with the duration of VPZ therapy.

   (PLA2R-abs) since its diagnostic significance on PLA2R related primary
   membranous nephropathy (PLA2R-related pMN) was discovered. However,
   PLA2R-abs determined by ELISA (PLA2R-ELISA) could infrequently yield
   inconclusive results, specifically a grey-zone defined as PLA2R-abs
   ranging from 2 to 20 RU/mL. Recently, researchers suggested that
   double-check grey-zone PLA2R-abs by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF)
   could improve diagnostic accuracy. We evaluated the diagnostic
   performance of PLA2R-IIF in assessing PLA2R-related pMN and summarized
   clinicopathological characteristics of grey-zone population to provide
   more evidence for clinical practice. Methods: Data on demographics,
   serology and pathology of patients with PLA2R-ELISA grey-zone results
   and a native kidney biopsy at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from
   September 2020 to April 2023 were reviewed. Grey-zone samples were
   analyzed using PLA2R-IIF. Negative results were defined as no
   fluorescence and positive results were graded according to fluorescence
   intensity. Results: This study included a total of 52 grey-zone patients
   divided into pMN group (n = 36, 69 %) and non-pMN group (n = 16, 31 %)
   according to renal pathology reports. The pMN patients had higher
   PLA2R-abs and lower serum creatinine compared to the non-pMN patients (P
   = 0.003, P < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were
   observed in 24-hour urine protein and albumin between the two groups.
   Multiple pathological types were identified in the non-pMN group. The
   sensitivity and specificity of PLA2R-IIF in PLA2R-ELISA grey-zone
   population were 72 % and 88 %, respectively, with a total consistent
   rate of 77 % and a positive predictive value of 93 %. Conclusion: Both
   pMN and non-pMN patients presented grey-zone PLA2R-ELISA results. It was
   necessary to perform PLA2R-IIF to assist in the diagnosis of patients
   with PLA2R-ELISA grey-zone results.

AB BackgroundUnited Kingdom Queer medical students' experiences have only
   been explored in depth in one previous study, despite longstanding calls
   to address National Health Service queerphobia. The study aims to
   combine our participants' data with personal insights from the Queer
   medical student research team to both record Queer medical students'
   experiences and provide practical actions that can promote support,
   inclusivity and celebration for Queer medical students.MethodsIndividual
   semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 participants across
   three medical schools in England and Scotland. Inductive thematic
   analysis was conducted. Insider insights were combined with analysis to
   generate practical advice for educators.ResultsParticipants had a broad
   range of Queer identities, including non-binary, bisexual and asexual
   identities. Four themes were identified, as well as a table of practical
   advice: Developing a unified Queer medical student identity: the
   cognitive and emotional process of aligning Queer and medical student
   identities; A culture of discrimination: actions occurring at cultural,
   system and individual levels that result in negative queerphobic
   experiences; A counterculture of support: representation and support
   provided by Queer faculty and doctors and Queer friends, and in
   curriculum material; Belonging and not belonging: thoughts and feelings
   of acceptance and value within academic, clinical and social
   environments.DiscussionQueer medical students continue to experience
   discrimination despite calls for change. We suggest a deeper cultural
   reimagination of belonging as a Queer medical student, alongside
   practical support from educators to create this, is needed to improve
   Queer medical students' experiences.

AB IntroductionLack of social support negatively impacts medical trainees'
   wellness. Programmes to educate medical trainees and their support
   persons (SPs) have been developed to improve resident wellness, but
   implementation of these programmes at other institutions remains
   unclear. We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing the
   Family Anesthesia Experience (FAX) programme across multiple
   institutions and to assess the programme's utility.MethodsFAX includes
   didactics on wellness, burnout, substance use disorder and institutional
   resources; a panel of senior residents and their SPs; and small-group
   simulations of airway management, common procedures and a high-fidelity
   intraoperative code. We assessed the programme qualitatively using
   semistructured interviews of 20 first year anaesthesiology residents and
   20 SPs. Data analysis was performed via a content analysis
   approach.ResultsTwelve anaesthesiology programmes of varying size and
   geographic locations implemented FAX with minor adaptations. Minimal
   direct costs were incurred for the virtual programme. Participants
   enjoyed the event overall. Content analysis showed that FAX improved
   SPs' understanding of residency and communication between SPs and
   residents, had minimal impact on SPs' stress, reduced residents'
   interpersonal stress with SPs and modified perceptions on wellness and
   burnout. We developed a conceptual model in which we propose SPs'
   understanding and empathy for their residents would improve through FAX,
   which may improve communication with and support for
   residents.ConclusionWe demonstrated that FAX can be implemented at
   varying anaesthesiology residency programmes. Family-oriented
   educational events like FAX may be an effective approach to improve SPs'
   understanding of a resident's role, thereby increasing social support
   for residents.

AB Introduction: Although Clinician Educator Tracks (CETs) have been
   developed for postgraduate trainees, more clarity is needed regarding
   which competencies are most relevant to resident and fellow physicians
   (housestaff) seeking to become Clinician Educators (CEs). Methods: We
   used the Clinician Educator Milestones, an established framework for
   competencies at the faculty level, to perform a targeted needs
   assessment at a large academic institution from April-May 2023.
   Educational leaders in undergraduate (UME), graduate (GME) and senior
   medical education (SME) leadership roles were asked to prioritise the
   Clinician Educator Milestones subcompetencies for a 1-year track.
   Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were performed;
   text comments underwent content analysis. Results: Of the 285 leaders,
   118 (41%) completed the survey. The average length in educational
   leadership was 6.9 +/- 5.6 years, with 33% having formal education
   training, 23% representing surgical specialities and 17% in SME roles.
   The subcompetencies of learner assessment and feedback were prioritised
   highest (86%), while change management was prioritised lowest (23%).
   Respondents in SME roles compared to UME and GME roles or those in
   educational leadership >= 6 years compared to < 6 years prioritised
   professionalism. Respondents without formal education training
   prioritised medical education scholarship more often than those with
   training. Surgical respondents more often prioritised administrative
   skills than nonsurgical respondents. Open-ended comments were generally
   positive towards a CET for housestaff, suggesting a hybrid format with
   flexible scheduling. Conclusions: Teaching-oriented subcompetencies were
   highly prioritised for a CET targeted at housestaff. The prioritisation
   choices offer guidance for a CE's progression through the
   subcompetencies.

AB Purpose of reviewTransplant oncology encompasses and utilizes liver
   transplantation (LT) in combination with other aspects of cancer care to
   offer improved long-term outcomes for patients with liver cancer, but
   not all patients have equal access and ability to undergo LT. Social
   determinants of health may negatively impact a patient's ability to
   receive liver-related oncologic care, including LT. This review
   highlights recent work exposing gaps in access to LT, including
   transplant oncology, and interventions to ameliorate these
   disparities.Recent findingsMembers of racial and ethnic minorities and
   indigenous groups, females, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons, and
   patients from rural areas are less likely to undergo LT. Recent studies
   have also described programs that have successfully mitigated some of
   the barriers in access to transplant oncology that these patients
   experience, including targeted outreach programs and access to virtual
   healthcare.SummaryDisparities in access to LT for liver cancer are
   increasingly well described, but additional research is needed to find
   effective ways to ameliorate these differences.

AB Purpose of reviewThis review summarizes the different instruments for
   evaluating the psychosocial health of transplant candidates, the
   evidence demonstrating how these instruments relate to probability of
   transplant waitlisting and transplant outcomes, and the critical
   knowledge gaps that exist in the causal pathway between psychosocial
   health and clinical transplant trajectory.Recent findingsThe current
   literature reveals that psychosocial assessments are a common reason for
   racial and ethnic minorities to be denied access to the transplant list.
   Given evidence that a lack of clinician consensus exists regarding the
   definition of, importance of, and reproducibility of psychosocial
   support evaluations, this facet of the holistic evaluation process may
   create a unique challenge for already vulnerable patient populations.
   Though recent evidence shows that psychosocial evaluation scores predict
   select transplant outcomes, these findings remain
   inconsistent.SummaryMultiple instruments for psychosocial transplant
   evaluation exist, though the utility of these instruments remains
   uncertain. As equity becomes an increasingly urgent priority for the
   transplant system, rigorous interrogation of the causal pathway between
   psychosocial health and transplant longevity is still needed.

   characterization and precision medicine, there is an urgent need for
   comprehensive data-sharing initiatives. This review explores how the
   Childhood Cancer Data Initiative (CCDI) addresses this critical
   need.Recent findingsCCDI plays a key role in enhancing pediatric cancer
   research by improving data integration, sharing, and collaboration. Its
   Molecular Characterization Initiative advances the field by leveraging
   detailed molecular data to inform clinical trials and therapeutic
   strategies. For small patient populations, such as those with
   rhabdomyosarcoma, CCDI's efforts in integrating data across institutions
   are vital for advancing risk-based treatment strategies to achieve
   meaningful clinical outcomes.SummaryCCDI's advancements in data sharing
   have profound implications for both clinical practice and research. By
   enabling precise diagnoses, tailoring treatments based on individual
   genetic profiles, and addressing the challenges associated with small
   patient populations, CCDI is driving transformative changes in pediatric
   oncology. Continued support and expansion of such initiatives are
   crucial to fully realizing their potential in improving outcomes for

AB Purpose of reviewDue to the infrequent nature of rare pediatric cancers,
   rigorously studied treatment algorithms are usually nonexistent, and
   experience with a given tumor may be limited at a single institution.
   Development of treatment plans for these populations often requires
   extensive literature review and outreach to experts at other
   institutions. National or international virtual tumor boards provide a
   streamlined, collaborative approach to discussing diagnosis and
   management of these patients through dissemination of collective
   experience and knowledge. This review highlights current virtual tumor
   boards for rare pediatric cancers and their benefit as a resource for
   patient care.Recent findingsOver the last several years, national
   virtual tumor boards sponsored by government and academic institutions
   and cancer foundations have expanded access of pediatric oncologists to
   rare tumor expertise and guidance. Recommendations from these tumor
   boards often have an impact on medical decision making, and some serve
   as a resource for enduring educational reference
   materials.SummaryNational virtual tumor boards are a valuable resource
   to clinicians caring for patients with rare pediatric tumors. These
   conferences provide real-time management advice from peers and subject
   matter experts and provide essential educational content not easily
   accessible in other formats.

AB Purpose of review To share important highlights on the management of
   anaphylaxis from the latest 2023 practice parameter. Recent findings The
   2023 Allergy Immunology Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP)
   anaphylaxis practice parameter provides updated anaphylaxis guidance.
   Criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis are reviewed. The parameter
   highlights that while anaphylaxis is not more severe in younger
   children, age-specific symptoms can vary. Activation of emergency
   medical services may not be required in patients who experience prompt
   resolution of symptoms following epinephrine use and caregivers are
   comfortable with observation. For children weighing <15 kg, the
   anaphylaxis parameter suggests the clinician may prescribe either the
   0.1 mg or the 0.15 mg epinephrine autoinjector, with the 0.3 mg
   autoinjector prescribed for those weighing 25 kg or greater. In patients
   with heart disease, discontinuing or changing beta blockers and/or
   angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors may pose a larger risk for
   worsened cardiovascular disease compared with risk for severe
   anaphylaxis with medication continuation. Furthermore, in patients with
   a history of perioperative anaphylaxis, shared decision-making based on
   diagnostic testing and clinical history is recommended prior to repeat
   anesthesia use. Beyond the recent parameter update, novel contemporary
   therapies can decrease risk of community anaphylaxis. Summary The 2023
   JTFPP Anaphylaxis Guidelines offer up-to-date guidance for the diagnosis
   and management of anaphylaxis in infants, children, and adults.

AB Due to the rising number of long-term mental health conditions, there
   has been a shift in therapeutic focus from curing these conditions, to
   living a meaningful life with them. Self-management is described as the
   ability to live with the emotional, life role and medical consequences
   of long-term conditions such as schizophrenia. However, the perspective
   of people with schizophrenia on self-management in current literature is
   missing. A lack of understanding of strategies used by people with
   schizophrenia to self-manage, could adversely affect the use of
   self-management interventions. Therefore, this study aims to identify
   how people with schizophrenia manage their daily life. Semi-structured
   interviews (n = 9) were conducted in a qualitative descriptive design.
   The study is reported by using the COREQ checklist. All participants,
   recruited through purposive sampling, have been stabilised after a
   schizophrenic episode and have been reintegrated into their community.
   The data were analysed through thematic analysis. Self-management for
   people with schizophrenia is an individualised process that revolves
   around performing day-to-day activities according to the participant's
   wishes. In addition, participants tried to prevent relapse by
   self-managing daily life. Personal-, social- and schizophrenia-related
   factors were seen as barriers and/or facilitators in their
   self-management. These barriers and/or facilitators were self-managed
   using daily activities. Current self-management interventions for this
   population often aim at improving medication adherence. Self-management
   interventions facilitated by health care professionals should (i) focus
   more on supporting patients in finding their daily structure through
   meaningful activities and (ii) be mindful of the duality contained
   within self-management of people with stabilised schizophrenia.

AB Nurses encounter many stressors and challenges at work, which can
   negatively affect their mental and physical health. Modern theories of
   resilience suggest that resilience is a dynamic process of positive
   adaptation to adversity. This process involves personal growth through
   adversity, developing effective coping strategies and inculcating the
   ability to cope with stress. The resilience process involves individual
   characteristics, social support and environmental factors, including
   workplace culture. Strengthening nurses' resilience can help them cope
   with adversity, maintain their mental health and well-being and support
   their provision of care. The aim of this study was to examine the
   associations between workplace characteristics, resilience and mental
   health status among nurses with experiences of workplace violence. The
   study objectives were to analyse the relationships between workplace
   characteristics, resilience and mental health status among nurses with
   experiences of workplace violence and to investigate the effects of
   resilience on nurses' mental health outcomes. In this cross-sectional
   study, full-time nurses at a medical centre in Taiwan completed a
   questionnaire survey. Of 600 distributed questionnaires, 334 nurses were
   identified to have experienced workplace violence. The questionnaires
   included items on workplace violence, resilience, metal health status
   (burnout and mental distress), sleep quality, work characteristics (job
   control, psychological job demands and workplace justice) and
   demographic characteristics. Data were analysed through chi-square tests
   and multivariate logistic regression. Nurses with low resilience tended
   to be younger, work more rotating/night shifts and perceive lower levels
   of job control and workplace justice. They also reported higher risks of
   burnout and mental distress and lower sleep quality. Multivariate
   logistic regression revealed that psychological job demands, workplace
   justice and resilience significantly influenced nurses' mental health
   status. Nurses with high resilience exhibited a lower risk of mental
   distress and higher sleep quality. However, resilience was not
   associated with burnout. The findings revealed how workplace factors and
   resilience influence nurses' mental health. The findings help nurse
   managers and policymakers develop strategies to promote nurses'
   resilience and mental health and mitigate the adverse effects of
   negative workplace events.

   clinical subtypes, including KSB type I (KSB-I), KSB type II (KSB-II),
   and Kufs syndrome C (KSC).DiscussionCLN13 was clinically heterogeneous.
   Most patients with CLN13 (14/20) did not present with classic KSB
   (KSB-I). Instead, 6 patients presented with KSB-II, 4 patients presented
   with KSC (including the present patient), and 3 patients presented with

AB Background: Smoking cessation at any age has been shown to improve
   quality of life, decrease illness, and reduce mortality. About half of
   smokers attempt to quit each year, but only similar to 7 % maintain
   long-term abstinence unaided. Few genetic factors have been consistently
   associated with smoking cessation, possibly due to poor phenotype
   definition.
   Methods: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with an
   alternative phenotype based on the difficulty of quitting smoking (DQS)
   in the Cancer Prevention Study-3 cohort. Difficult quitters were defined
   as having made at least ten quit attempts, whether successful or not,
   and easy quitters as having quit after only one attempt. Only
   individuals of European ancestry were selected for the study. Among
   10,004 smokers (5,071 difficult quitters, 4,933 easy quitters), we
   assessed the genetic heritability of DQS and evaluated associations
   between DQS and each genome-wide variant using logistic regression while
   adjusting for confounders, including smoking intensity (cigarettes per
   day).
   Results: The genetic heritability of the DQS phenotype was 13 %,
   comparable to, or higher than, the reported heritability of other
   smoking behaviors (e.g., smoking intensity, cessation). Although no
   variants were genomewide significant, several genes were identified at a
   subthreshold level (p < 10-4). A variant in MEGF9 (rs149760032), a
   transmembrane protein largely expressed in the central nervous system,
   showed the strongest association with DQS (OR = 0.60, p = 1.3x10(-7)).
   Additional variants associated with DQS independently by smoking
   intensity were also detected in GLRA3 (rs73006492, OR = 0.77, p =
   5.6x10(-7)) and FOCAD (rs112251973, OR = 1.96, p = 1.8x10(-6)) and are
   plausibly related to smoking cessation through pathways in the brain and
   respiratory system.
   Conclusions: The use of an alternative cessation phenotype based on
   difficulty quitting smoking facilitated the identification of new
   pathways that could lead to unique smoking treatments.

AB Advancing modern technology has propelled biomedicine and materials
   science to the forefront of scientific interest. As modern science
   evolves, it demands greater synergy between disciplines. In the realm of
   orthopaedics, the complex architecture of bone necessitates implants
   that balance strength with porosity. This dual requirement beckons a
   profound grasp that spans the realms of biomedicine and materials
   science, urging a deep dive into both fields to craft the perfect
   synergy for bone implant materials. Journeying through materials and
   orthopaedic science, this article systematically discussed the
   preparation of 3D porous structures by electrospinning technology for
   orthopaedics. It began by detailing electrospinning techniques, their
   principles, processes, materials, and design strategies within materials
   science. Material characterization methods were then presented. In
   biomedicine, we offered a concise overview of standard testing methods,
   from cell viability to staining. Building on the foundational knowledge
   of both fields, it reviewed 3D electrospinning strategies and summarized
   recent research progress in bone tissue culture with this method. This
   review sought to offer a structured comprehension of the intersecting
   disciplines to researchers, establishing a robust basis for material
   innovation tailored to orthopaedic-specific demands.

AB center dot PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of two botulinum toxin
   (BoNT) injection methods, pretarsal (PT) combined with preseptal (PS)
   injection (PT-PS) and conventional PT injection, in the treatment of
   benign essential blepharospasm (BEB). center dot DESIGN: Prospective
   nonrandomized clinical trial. center dot METHODS: From January 2023 to
   April 2024, 95 BoNT injections into orbicularis oculi were performed in
   45 BEB patients, including 52 PT-PS injections s and 43 PT injections.
   Jankovic Rating Scale (JRS) and Blepharospasm Disability Index (BSDI)
   were used to assess motor symptoms. The efficacy of two injection
   methods for BEB was compared in terms of latency to response (LTR),
   latency to the peak response (LPR), duration of peak response (DPR),
   duration of response (DOR), satisfaction degree, and possible
   complications. center dot RESULTS: Both injection methods significantly
   improved JRS and BSDI scores in patients with BEB. However, PT-PS
   injections showed a shorter LTR ([4.00 (3.00, 6.00] vs 5.00 [4.00, 7.00]
   days, P = .024) and LPR (23.50 [16.00, 26.00] vs 26.00 [20.00, 30.00]
   days, P = .040), a longer DPR (88.00 [80.50, 104.75] vs 75.00 [65.00,
   92.00] days, P = .003) and DOR (135.00 [118.50, 153.75] vs 121.00
   [107.00, 135.00] days, P = .003) than PT injections. Patients with PT-
   PS injections were more satisfied than those with PT injections (9.50
   [8.50, 10.00] vs 8.00 [7.50, 9.00], P < .001), and around 2/3 of
   patients were more willing to receive the combined injection method
   later. Among patients receiving PT-PS injections, only one case
   experienced ptosis, and there were no significant differences in other
   complications such as lacrimation, dry eyes, and blurred vision between
   the two injection methods. center dot CONCLUSIONS: PT-PS injections of
   BoNT showed more advantages in the treatment of BEB than PT injec tions
   in terms of both their efficacy and patients' satisfactions

AB PURPOSE: To characterize a large modern cohort of patients with central
   retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) by describing presenting features and
   outcomes relating to manually segmented optical coherence tomography
   (OCT) features, angiographic reperfusion, and visual recovery. DESIGN:
   Retrospective clinical cohort study. METHODS: Patients with CRAO
   (ICD-10: H34.1) initially presenting to a tertiary referral center
   between January 2017 and December 2021 were included. Demographics, eye
   exam findings, fundus photographs, OCT, and fluorescein angiography were
   analyzed. Main outcome measures included total and inner retinal
   thickness on macular OCT, reperfusion, visual outcomes, and development
   of neovascularization. RESULTS: A total of 145 eyes of 144 patients with
   mean age at of 69.4 +/- 13.6 years were included. The mean time to
   presentation was 1.6 +/- 4.2 days, with 19% examined within 4.5 hours
   and 26% within 6 hours of vision loss. 19% had cilioretinal artery
   (CLRA) sparing. Mean initial visual acuity (VA) was 1.68 +/- 1.10
   Logarithm of the Minimum Angle of Resolution (LogMAR) (CLRA sparing)
   compared to 2.53 +/- 0.58 LogMAR (non-CLRA sparing), P < .001. 32% had
   elevated inflammatory makers. Out of 47 eyes with final fluorescein
   angiography, one-third showed some reperfusion. Final vision was 1.40
   +/- 1.16 LogMAR (CLRA sparing) compared to 2.46 +/- 0.81 (non-CLRA
   sparing), P < .001. A third of patients improved in VA in both groups,
   27% of patients gained more than 2 lines of vision in the CLRA-sparing
   group and 36% in the non-CLRA-sparing group. 17% improved to better than
   20/200 in CLRA-sparing and 4% in non-CLRA sparing. Overall, 11%
   developed neovascularization all in non-CLRA sparing. In a multiple
   linear regression, VA at presentation was associated with regaining
   vision of 2 lines or more (OR = 2.603, P = .007). OCT showed progressive
   thinning over time, reaching lowest measurements at 6 months, and
   stabilizing thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: In this modern cohort of acute CRAO
   patients, presentation to a tertiary facility within 12 hours of
   symptoms was seen in almost half of the patients. Final VA improved in
   almost a third of the patients, however, vision better than the legal
   blindness limit was rare ( '- 5%). Interestingly, a third of patients
   had some mild elevation of systemic inflammatory markers. Better VA at
   presentation was associated with visual gain, while baseline OCT values
   had poor correlation with final outcome.

   endothelial cell density (ECD) loss of 2 types of iris-fixated phakic
   intraocular lenses (pIOL) and indicate the cutoff values for preventing
   irreversible ECD loss after explantation. center dot DESIGN: The
   retrospective, comparative, clinical cohort study. center dot METHODS:
   Total 114 eyes of 61 patients were included in this study. Fifty-five
   eyes with Artisan pIOL and 59 eyes with Artiflex pIOL had undergone
   explantation of pIOLs due to continuous ECD loss. Correlation analysis
   was performed to assess the ocular parameters associated with ECD loss.
   Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to set
   cutoff values of ocular parameters to prevent ECD loss after
   explantation. center dot RESULTS: The mean ECD before explantation was
   1637 cells/mm2 in Artisan group and 1769 cells/mm2 in Artiflex group.
   The distance of cornea endothelium to IOL center and edges were all
   significantly higher in Artisan group ( P < .05). The risk factor of
   decreased ECD in Artisan group were small anterior chamber angle (ACA),
   and distance of nasal edge of IOL to endothelium and iris fixation to
   nasal limbus distance, and differences of fixation length. In Artiflex
   group, ACA, distance of nasal edge of IOL to endothelium, both limbus to
   IOL fixation length, fixation length, iris pigmentation grading were the
   risk factors. At 1 year after the pIOL removal, the population
   demonstrating D ECD > 10% were significantly higher in Artisan group
   than Artiflex group ( P < .05). In ROC curve analysis, the cutoff value
   of preoperative ECD to prevent significant postexplantation ECD loss was
   1683.5 cells/mm2 in Artisan group and 1648 cells/mm2 in Artiflex group.
   center dot CONCLUSIONS: This study examined the existing ex- plantation
   guidelines for these lenses. In analyzing the longterm prognosis of
   cornea ECD with Iris-fixated phakic intraocular lens, it is important to
   identify the relevant anatomical factors. Small ACA, and short distances
   from IOL to endothelium and from limbus to iris fixation especially in
   the nasal region were significant risk factors to continuous ECD loss in
   both lenses. To minimize irreversible ECD loss after explantation, it is
   important to determine the optimal period of explantation by observing
   both ECD and structural changes. (Am J Ophthalmol 2025;270: 52-60. (c)

   population of Americans. center dot DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
   center dot METHODS: We used the National Institute of Health's All of Us
   Research Program database to identify 18257 participants with DED who
   were propensity score matched in a 1:3 ratio to participants without
   DED. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used
   to assess associations between DED and mental health conditions (i.e.,
   depressive disorders, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenic
   spectrum disorder). center dot RESULTS: Participants with DED had a
   significantly higher prevalence of depressive disorders (31.6% vs.
   10.7%; P < .001), anxiety disorders (34.8% vs. 14.7%; P < .001), bipolar
   disorder (5.5% vs. 2.3%; P < .001), and schizophrenia spectrum disorders
   (2.3% vs. 0.9%; P < .001) than controls. Adjusted for medical
   comorbidities (i.e., hypothyroidism, Sj & ouml;gren's syndrome, systemic
   lupus erythematosus), participants with DED had higher odds than
   controls in having a depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR]: 3.47; 95% CI:
   3.32-3.62), anxiety (OR: 2.74; 95% CI: 2.63-2.85), bipolar disorder (OR:
   2.23; 95% CI: 2.04-2.44), and schizophrenia spectrum disor der (OR:
   2.48; 95% CI: 2.17-2.84). The association between DED and mental health
   conditions was stronger in Black participants than White participants
   (OR: 3.68 vs. 3.09, P < .001). center dot CONCLUSIONS: Participants with
   DED were significantly more likely to have mental health conditions than
   matched participants without DED; this association was stronger in Black
   participants than White participants. Greater efforts should be
   undertaken to screen DED patients for mental health conditions,
   particularly in historically medically underserved populations. (c) 2024

AB Urinary N-1, N-12-diacetylspermine (DAS) is a known biomarker for
   colorectal cancer (CRC). However, DAS levels in both healthy and CRC
   patients' urine samples are extremely low and often challenging to
   quantify. Complex and expensive methods do exist to detect DAS in urine,
   but simpler, less expensive methods to detect DAS are needed, especially
   in low resource settings. Here we describe a highly efficient, fast,
   precise, and inexpensive colorimetric assay to detect low levels of DAS
   in human urine samples. We used recombinant diacetylspermine oxidase
   (rDAS Ox), expressed and extracted from E. coli, to oxidize DAS,
   producing three products including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The level
   of DAS present, which correlates with H2O2 levels, was measured using
   horseradish peroxidase (HRP), which together with H2O2, oxidized Amplex
   (TM) Red to produce the pink-colored resorufin. The concentration of
   resorufin is directly proportional to H2O2 (and DAS) levels. As urine
   contains metabolites which interfere with these oxidation reactions, we
   developed a simple two column-based protocol using ion exchange resins
   to remove these compounds and concentrate the DAS. With this novel
   cleaning and concentrating method, DAS was concentrated 15 times
   (confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy) and <1 mu M
   DAS could be detected. Correlation graphs of urine samples spiked with
   known DAS concentrations versus assay-determined DAS concentrations had
   high coefficients of determination (R-2) for 0-10 mu M DAS (0.94) and
   for 0-1 mu M DAS (0.91), clearly demonstrating the excellent performance
   of the two-column protocol with the rDAS Ox reaction mixture. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is first reported colorimetric enzymatic
   assay that quantitates DAS in urine.

AB Organic precipitation of proteins with acetonitrile demonstrated
   complete protein recovery and improved chromatography of human plasma
   proteins. The separation of 25 mu L of human plasma into 22 fractions on
   a QA SAX resin facilitated more effective protein discovery despite the
   limited sample size. Micro chromatography of plasma proteins over
   quaternary amine (QA) strong anion exchange (SAX) resins performed best,
   followed by diethylaminoethyl (DEAE), heparin (HEP), carboxymethyl
   cellulose (CMC), and propyl sulfate (PS) resins. Two independent
   statistical methods, Monte Carlo comparison with random MS/MS spectra
   and the rigorous X! TANDEM goodness of fit algorithm protein p-values
   corrected to false discovery rate q-values (q <= 0.01) agreed on at
   least 12,000 plasma proteins, each represented by at least three fully
   tryptic corrected peptide observations. There was qualitative agreement
   on 9393 protein/gene symbols between the linear quadrupole versus
   orbital ion trap but also quantitative agreement with a highly
   significant linear regression relationship between log observation
   frequency (F value 4,173, p-value 2.2e-16). The use of a QA resin showed
   nearly perfect replication of all the proteins that were also found
   using DEAE-, HEP-, CMC-, and PS-based chromatographic methods combined
   and together estimated the size of the size of the plasma proteome as >=
   12,000 gene symbols.

AB The selection of sea cucumbers characterized by resilience to
   temperature changes, handling stress, and disease is the key to
   enhancing the efficiency of Apostichopus japonicus production. Color
   morphs were devised to distinguish the resilience of A. japonicus. The
   objective of the present study was to evaluate the behavioral and
   physiological differences of seeds of A. japonicus in different colored
   under the condition of acute drop of temperature, seawater washing, and
   Vibrio infection. The dark-colored individuals showed significantly
   higher food consumption, fecal output, and glycogen phosphorylase
   activity under the condition of acute temperature drop. This connotates
   that dark-colored seeds demonstrate a swifter resumption of feeding
   activities and exhibit superior adaptability in rapidly cooling
   environments. Significantly longer foraging distance and foraging time,
   as well as faster foraging speed, and higher cortisol concentration were
   found in dark-colored individuals after seawater washing. This indicates
   that dark-colored individuals exhibit a swift responsiveness to handling
   stress, enabling prompt resumption of foraging activities. Dark-colored
   seeds have more survived number and higher catalase activity after
   Vibrio infection. This indicates that dark-colored individuals manifest
   a heightened resistance to Vibrio infection. In conclusion, dark-colored
   seeds of A. japonicus have a stronger ability to resist temperature
   changes, handling stress, and disease.

   subtilis WB60) on water quality parameters, growth performance, feed
   utilization, immunity response, intestinal microbes, and histological
   investigations of Pacific whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)
   challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Shrimp juveniles (4.98 +/- 0.11
   g) were distributed into four experimental groups (twelve 1 m3 hapa, 25
   shrimps/m3/each hapa, 3 triplicates/group). The first group (G0) used
   only fermented B. subtilis at a rate of 0.2 g/acre. The 2nd, 3rd, and
   4th groups contained the same constant level of B. subtilis (0.2 g/acre)
   with three different levels of fermented MOS at 25, 50, and 75 g/acre
   (G1, G2, and G3, respectively). The results showed that TAN and NH3
   values were significantly lower in all fermented groups compared to G0.
   Increasing the levels of fermented MOS led to significant improvements
   in growth performance, feed utilization, shrimp biomass, survival rate,
   crude protein, and ash content (p < 0.05). Compared to G0, the values of
   SOD, CAT, and IgM were significantly improved, while MDA levels were
   significantly decreased in all fermented MOS levels (p < 0.05). The G3
   group exhibited the highest values of immune responses, including total
   hemocyte count, phagocytic activity, phagocytic index, respiratory burst
   activity, and lysozyme activity, as well as phenol oxide activity and
   total aerobic bacteria compared to the other groups (p < 0.05).
   Moreover, the G2 and G3 groups showed significantly lower mortality
   (30%) of shrimp challenged with V. parahaemolyticus infection compared
   to G0. In conclusion, the commercial scale recommends using fermented
   MOS and B. subtilis (50-75 g/acre) as water culture additives for shrimp
   L. vannamei due to the improvements in growth performance, feed
   utilization, immunological, and antioxidant indicators.

AB Impact of opportunistic bacterial pathogens and their antimicrobial
   resistance continues to increase in aquaculture, posing significant
   public health concerns. The present study aimed to investigate the
   incidence of mortality in cultured Nile tilapia, O. niloticus in Andhra
   Pradesh, India. Diseased samples exhibiting exophthalmia, swollen
   abdomen, hemorrhages and pale gills were collected to isolate pathogenic
   bacteria. The bacteria were characterized using cultural, biochemical
   characteristics and 16 S rRNA gene sequence. The isolate had 99.66%
   homology with Micrococcus luteus (GenBank accession no. PP659810). The
   cumulative mortality LD50 was calculated as 1.39 x 105 CFU per fish.
   Histopathological alterations revealed hyperplasia and fusion of gill
   lamellae, enlarged hepatocytes, degenerative renal tubules, fibrous
   lesions, ellipsoidal compression of white pulp, degeneration of splenic
   tissue, and melano-macrophage centres. Antibiogram studies revealed that
   M. luteus showed varying degrees of resistance to different antibiotics,
   with a multiple antibiotic resistance index of 0.62 +/- 0.3. Mortality
   rate in cultured farm and experimental infection is 30% and 70%,
   respectively. These findings highlight that M. luteus can be considered
   as one of the potential bacterial pathogens in Nile tilapia. Our
   findings highlight that Good Aquaculture Practices (GAP), biosecurity,
   disease surveillance, and the One Health Approach are essential for
   tackling AMR- and disease-related issues. This report forms the first
   record of emergence of M. luteus infection in cultured Nile tilapia, O.
   niloticus in India.

AB The study examined the effects of different probiotics on growth,
   survival, and immune gene expression in Macrobrachium rosenbergii
   post-larvae (PL). The PL were fed with MY-1, Enterotrophotic (ENT), and
   MY-1 + Enterotrophotic (MY-1 + ENT) enriched artemia for a duration of
   20 days, with three feedings per day. Throughout the experiment, water
   quality parameters were closely monitored. Results showed that the
   postlarvae fed with MY-1 + ENT exhibited better growth in terms of size
   and weight compared to the other groups. On the 21st day, both the
   control and treated PL were exposed to pathogenic Vibrio alginolyticus.
   The groups administered with MY-1 + ENT had higher survival rates
   compared to the other treatment and control groups. Moreover, the
   expression levels of immune-related genes such as cytochrome oxidase
   (COX), prophenoloxidase (proPO), peroxinectin (PE),
   antilipopolysaccharide (ALF), and lipopolysaccharide glucan binding
   protein (LGBP) were examined through qPCR. The results indicated a
   variable expression pattern suggesting that the application of
   probiotics enhances the expression and regulation of immune genes in the
   event of infection by V. alginolyticus. The differences in gene
   expression highlight the opportunity to develop Immune Gene Expression
   Finger Printing, which may act as an effective tool for evaluating
   probiotics and immunostimulants by assessing their ability to modulate
   immune responses in M. rosenbergii. The study warrants field-level
   validation of the findings to facilitate the adoption in the hatchery
   technology for scampi seed production too.

AB Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) aimed to
   determine whether the presence of H. pylori in dental plaque is
   associated with gastric H. pylori infection.<br /> Design: Search for
   the relevant literature was done in various databases: PubMed, Embase,
   Web of Science and Cochrane till September 21, 2023. The studies were
   screened for outcome of interest i.e. gastric H. pylori infection and
   exposure of interest i.e. H. pylori positivity in dental plaque. The
   pooled results of the study outcomes were evaluated using Odds Ratio
   (OR), accompanied by a 95 % confidence interval (CI). To evaluate the
   heterogeneity among studies, I-2 statistics were utilized, with an I-2
   exceeding 50 % indicating a significant to high variation. In cases
   where I-2 was greater than 50 %, a random-effects model (specifically,
   the Der Simonian and Laird method) was employed.<br /> Results: Data
   from 27 observational studies and 2408 participants were included. The
   pooled OR of the H. pylori positivity in dental plaque among the
   patients with H. pylori positivity in stomach was 3.80 (95% CI 2.24;
   6.43), with high heterogeneity (I-2= 69 %, p<0.01). Sensitivity analysis
   after removing the outliers reduced the heterogeneity significantly
   (I-2=22 %, p=0.16). Meta-regression revealed that the strength of
   association did not vary according to the year of study or the sample
   size included in the studies. Overall certainty of the evidence was low.
   Conclusions: The present meta-analysis showed that the presence of
   gastric H. pylori infection was higher among patients with H. pylori in
   dental plaque compared to patients without H. pylori in dental plaque.
   Presence of H. pylori infection in dental plaque can have implications
   in the management of H. pylori infection as dental plaque can serve as a
   reservoir from which the microorganism can recolonize the gastric
   mucosa.

AB The recombinant spider silk proteins (spidroins) are promising
   biomaterials for the use as drug delivery system (DDS) because of their
   non-cytotoxicity, low immunogenicity and customizable properties.
   However, most reported spidroin-based materials as DDS derive from the
   repetitive domain of dragline silk protein, limiting us to take
   advantage of their desirable properties for medical and industrial
   innovation. Here, we produced the recombinant aciniform silk protein
   (rAcSp2) that contains only the N-terminal domain and formulated it into
   nanoparticles for use as a DDS. We demonstrated that antitumor peptide
   drugs such as ChMAP-28 can be loaded onto rAcSp2 particles via
   electrostatic interaction, with a high loading capacity of up to 45 %
   (w/w) and nearly 100 % loading efficiency. In addition, the release of
   ChMAP-28 depends on the pH and ionic strength of the release buffer. In
   the meantime, rAcSp2 particles not only effectively reduce the toxicity
   of ChMAP-28 to normal cells, but also significantly enhance its
   anti-tumor activity. Therefore, our rAcSp2 particles are a promising
   novel particulate drug carrier system for the delivery of peptide drugs
   with anti-tumor activity.

AB Coronary heart disease (CHD) and cognitive impairment frequently
   co-occur in aging populations, yet the molecular mechanisms linking
   these conditions remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the roles
   of key aging-related genes (ARGs), specifically FKBP5 and DDIT3, in the
   pathophysiology of CHD and cognitive impairment, and to evaluate the
   therapeutic potential of stellate ganglion block (SGB). Using
   single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing (bulk
   RNA-seq) data, we identified FKBP5 and DDIT3 as pivotal genes
   upregulated in both conditions. Experimental findings show that SGB
   effectively modulates these ARG-related pathways through autonomic
   regulation, specifically suppressing estrogen and NF-kappa B signaling
   pathways, thereby reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
   such as SRC, MMP2, FKBP5, IRAK1, and MYD88, while upregulating the
   vasodilation-related gene NOS3. This modulation improved endothelial and
   cardiac function and enhanced cerebral blood flow (CBF), leading to
   cognitive improvement. Behavioral assessments, including novel object
   recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests, demonstrated that
   SGB-treated rats outperformed untreated MI rats, with significant
   cognitive recovery over time. Further support from laser Doppler
   flowmetry (LDF) and electroencephalogram (EEG) analyses revealed
   increased left frontal blood flow and stabilized neural activity,
   indicating a favorable neurophysiological environment for cognitive
   rehabilitation. Our findings suggest that left stellate ganglion block
   (LSGB) provides both cardiac and cognitive benefits through targeted
   gene modulation, establishing its therapeutic potential for addressing
   the intersecting pathologies of CHD and cognitive impairment.

AB Diagnostic approaches that combine the high sensitivity and specificity
   of laboratory-based digital detection with the ease of use and
   affordability of point-of-care (POC) technologies could revolutionize
   disease diagnostics. This is especially true in infectious disease
   diagnostics, where rapid and accurate pathogen detection is critical to
   curbing the spread of disease. We have pioneered an innovative
   label-free digital detection platform that utilizes Interferometric
   Reflectance Imaging Sensor (IRIS) technology. IRIS leverages light
   interference from an optically transparent thin film, eliminating the
   need for complex optical resonances to enhance the signal by harnessing
   light interference and the power of signal averaging in
   shot-noise-limited operation In our latest work, we have further
   improved our previous 'Single-Particle' IRIS (SP-IRIS) technology by
   allowing the construction of the optical signature of target
   nanoparticles (whole virus) from a single image. This new platform,
   'Pixel-Diversity' IRIS (PD-IRIS), eliminated the need for z-scan
   acquisition, required in SP-IRIS, a time-consuming and expensive
   process, and made our technology more applicable to POC settings. Using
   PD-IRIS, we quantitatively detected the Monkeypox virus (MPXV), the
   etiological agent for Monkeypox (Mpox) infection. MPXV was captured by
   antiA29 monoclonal antibody (mAb 69-126-3) on Protein G spots on the
   sensor chips and were detected at a limit-of-detection (LOD) - of 200
   PFU/mL (similar to 3.3 aM). PD-IRIS was superior to the laboratory-based
   ELISA (LOD 1800 PFU/mL) used as a comparator. The specificity of PD-IRIS
   in MPXV detection was demonstrated using Herpes simplex virus, type 1
   (HSV-1), and Cowpox virus (CPXV). This work establishes the
   effectiveness of PDIRIS and opens possibilities for its advancement in
   clinical diagnostics of Mpox at POC. Moreover, PD-IRIS is a modular
   technology that can be adapted for the multiplex detection of pathogens
   for which high-affinity ligands are available that can bind their
   surface antigens to capture them on the sensor surface.

   Here, we develop a typical two-dimensional (2D) composite semiconductor
   of BP@MoS2 with special synergistic chemical enhancement-mediated
   surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity. The relative
   proportion of MoS2 and BP was rationally adjusted in the hydrothermal
   reaction to screen a composite sample with high charge transfer
   efficiency. Furthermore, the optimal BP@MoS2 nanocomposites were
   integrated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film based on a
   hydrophilic-hydrophobic scheme to improve the collection and on-site
   monitoring capability of SERS substrate. Unlike the conventional
   detection chip, this hydrophilic-hydrophobic model could facilitate the
   block design of active areas on the PDMS matrix, which was benefit for
   the high-throughput detection. More importantly, this SERS substrate was
   applied to directly monitor urinary tract pathogens of Escherichia coli,
   facilitating satisfactory recoveries between 90% and 110%. Overall, the
   as-proposed PDMS-BP@MoS2 SERS substrate exhibited advantages in the
   collection, quantification, and high- throughput fingerprint recognition
   of pathogenic bacteria, offering a new avenue for the clinical

AB Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious chronic disease characterized by
   abnormally high blood glucose (Glu) levels, which can cause organ
   malfunction and metabolic disturbances. However, traditional biomarkers
   like Glu face limitations due to intraday fluctuations and inability to
   detect early stages of DM. To tackle these challenges, this study has
   introduced a colorimetric-fluorescence dual-mode biosensor utilizing
   alpha-glucosidase (alpha-GAA), which enables early diabetes screening
   without being influenced by physiological fluctuations in blood glucose
   levels. Specifically, chitosan-modified copper nanoclusters (Cu
   NC@CS-Ce3+: AP-CuCC) with exceptional peroxidase (POD) activity and
   Ce3+-induced aggregate-induced luminescence (AIE) properties have been
   synthesized. The targeted hydrolysis of the alpha-GAA substrate,
   4-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (pNGP), results in the formation
   of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) and Glu. While p-NP statically quenches an
   increase in AP-CuCC fluorescence signal, Glu facilitates the production
   of H2O2 by glucose oxidase during AP-CuCC POD enzyme reactions,
   triggering colorimetric changes in the reaction. The detection limits
   for colorimetric and fluorescence measurements were determined to be
   0.03 U/L and 0.02 U/L, respectively. By integrating fluorescence
   analysis, this method cleverly mitigates the confusing effects of normal
   blood Glu levels on colorimetric outcomes, allowing for the
   consideration of abnormal Glu levels as a supplementary diagnostic tool.
   Compared to relying solely on colorimetry, this dual-mode approach
   reduces false positive rates by 50% and false negative rates by 25%.
   Leveraging the sensor's colorimetric and fluorescent capabilities
   provides a versatile platform for precise and reliable evaluation of
   aberrant expression markers across various clinical settings.

AB The oriented assembly of cell membrane coating plays an important role
   in advancing the application of this strategy in biomedical fields,
   particularly in detecting circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Unfortunately,
   there is a formidable challenge in achieving effective membrane
   orientation during the coating process owing to the asymmetric
   properties of cell membranes. Herein, magnetic vesicles released by
   tumor cells were designed to break down these barriers in the same way
   that microvesicles are actively secreted from cells, which completely
   inherited the orientation and characteristics of the parent cell
   membranes, exhibiting a satisfactory self-targeting ability for
   homologous cells. To cope with the complex application environment,
   spatially ordered aptamers were integrated into magnetic vesicles and
   combined with catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) technology to construct a
   recognition site-ordered biomimetic sensor for high-performance
   detection of CTCs. In this strategy, the ordered arrangement of membrane
   proteins and aptamers markedly improved capture efficiency of
   traditional biomimetic strategy for CTCs. Additionally, CHA-induced
   fluorescence and colorimetric analysis ensured the detection accuracy
   and sensitivity, with a linear range of 0 to 104 cells mL- 1 and a low
   detection limit of 3 cells mL- 1 for fluorometry and 6 cells mL- 1 for
   colorimetry. Overall, the biomimetic sensor offered broader
   possibilities for detecting rare CTCs and provided new insight to expand
   the application of cell membrane biomimetic strategies in biomedicine.

AB Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are the most common type of
   osteoporotic fractures, yet they are often clinically silent and
   undiagnosed. Chest frontal radiographs (CFRs) are frequently used in
   clinical practice and a portion of VCFs can be detected through this
   technology. This study aimed to develop an automatic artificial
   intelligence (AI) tool using deep learning (DL) model for the
   opportunistic screening of VCFs from CFRs. The datasets were collected
   from four medical centers, comprising 19,145 vertebrae (T6-T12) from
   2735 patients. Patients from Center 1, 2 and 3 were divided into the
   training and internal testing datasets in an 8:2 ratio (n = 2361, with
   16,527 vertebrae). Patients from Center 4 were used as the external test
   dataset (n = 374, with 2618 vertebrae). Model performance was assessed
   using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and the area under the curve
   (AUC). A reader study with five clinicians of different experience
   levels was conducted with and without AI assistance. In the internal
   testing dataset, the model achieved a sensitivity of 83.0 % and an AUC
   of 0.930 at the fracture level. In the external testing dataset, the
   model demonstrated a sensitivity of 78.4 % and an AUC of 0.942 at the
   fracture level. The model's sensitivity outperformed that of five
   clinicians with different levels of experience. Notably, AI assistance
   significantly improved sensitivity at the patient level for both junior
   clinicians (from 56.1 % without AI to 81.6 % with AI) and senior
   clinicians (from 65.0 % to 85.6 %). In conclusion, the automatic AI tool
   significantly increases clinicians' sensitivity in diagnosing fractures
   on CFRs, showing great potential for the opportunistic screening of
   VCFs.

AB Background: Musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases represent a significant
   global public health challenge. Conducting comprehensive research on MSK
   diseases in China holds profound implications for public health.
   Methods: This study utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease 2021
   (GBD 2021) to analyze the incidence rate, prevalence rate, mortality
   rate, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), years lived with
   disability (YLDs), and years of life lost (YLLs) of MSK diseases in
   China from 1990 to 2021. Trends were evaluated using annual percentage
   change (APC), average annual percentage change (AAPC), and estimated
   annual percentage change (EAPC). Future disease trends were predicted
   using the Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort (BAPC) model. Results: China had
   the highest number of DALYs cases globally, totaling 30.4194 million.
   Low back pain (LBP) represented the largest burden, while hand
   osteoarthritis exhibited the fastest growth. Differences in disease
   burden were observed across various genders and age groups. Predictions
   indicate that between 2021 and 2030, the age-standardized DALYs rate in
   China will increase annually, reaching 1779.08 per 100,000 population by
   2030. Environmental (occupational) factors had the most significant
   impact on the age-standardized DALYs rate, whereas renal dysfunction had
   the least impact. The SDI showed a moderately strong positive
   correlation with the age-standardized DALYs rate of MSK diseases.
   Conclusion: Over the past 20 years, the prevalence of MSK diseases in
   China has experienced a slight increase, while other epidemiological
   burden indicators have shown a downward trend. Projections indicate that
   the overall disease burden of MSK in China will continue to rise over
   the next decade, underscoring the need for early intervention
   strategies. Moreover, substantial differences in MSK disease burden
   across genders and age groups highlight the importance of developing
   targeted policy interventions to mitigate this burden.

   microneedle (DMN) has been proposed as a painless and highly efficient
   transdermal drug delivery system to resolve this challenge, minocycline,
   widely used for the treatment of periodontitis, is light-sensitive,
   making it challenging to maintain its stability using conventional
   fabrication methods. Our hyaluronic acid-based minocycline-loaded
   dissolving microneedle (HAM-DMN) was designed utilizing an innovative
   light-blocking strategy, preserving 94.4 % of minocycline's stability,
   as confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
   (LC-MS/MS) analysis. HAM-DMNs demonstrated antimicrobial efficacy in in
   vitro zone of inhibition tests with Streptococcus mutans strains and
   provided enhanced local delivery of minocycline to porcine oral gingival
   mucosa at concentrations 6.1 times higher than those of commercial
   ointments. In vivo studies in periodontitis-induced rat models showed
   that HAM-DMNs reduced levels of junctional epithelium more effectively
   than control and blank DMN groups, indicating enhanced treatment
   efficacy. HAM-DMN is a novel local delivery system developed to overcome
   the limitations of systemic delivery and conventional topical treatment.
   We suggest that HAM-DMNs can replace injections for the treatment of
   intraoral mucosal and systemic diseases.

AB Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most significant neoplasms globally due
   to its high incidence and mortality, particularly among females. As a
   highly heterogeneous pathology, biomarkers are essential for
   characterizing specific tumors. Currently, several biological processes
   are well-described in the context of this neoplasm, such as alterations
   in BRCA1/2, HER, and pathways involving estrogen and progesterone
   hormone receptors. These studies have enabled the use of these findings
   as more precise methods for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.
   However, beyond patients who do not exhibit these classic markers, some
   individuals within the same risk group respond differently to treatment.
   Therefore, the search for biological markers that can improve diagnosis,
   aid in stratification, or serve as therapeutic targets is continuous and
   urgent. Genetic signatures have led to molecular tests currently used in
   clinical practice, though certain limitations persist. Understanding
   genetic and epigenetic mechanisms facilitates the identification of
   potential biomarkers. Biomarker targets must undergo experimental and
   clinical trials on samples of significant size before reaching clinical
   utility. In this review, we compile the classical markers and describe
   the potential use of other markers associated with the biological
   processes of this neoplasm.

AB BackgroundBest practice evidence for identifying and managing
   professional behaviour lapses in a multidisciplinary context is lacking.
   This study aimed to evaluate multidisciplinary educators' attitudes and
   perceptions of the ProFESS (Professional standards, Ethical Behaviour
   and Student Support) framework and its companion Fitness for Practice
   model, designed and implemented at a large Australian university to
   address this using a behaviour change approach.MethodsA 72-item survey
   based on the Context, Input, Process, Product evaluation framework was
   completed by 92 multidisciplinary faculty educators and analysed using
   descriptive and inferential statistics. Content analysis of open text
   responses occurred.FindingsProFESS and Fitness for Practice were found
   to be acceptable irrespective of the discipline using them, providing a
   supportive, transparent, consistent approach for identifying and
   managing a professional behaviour lapse. Other key strengths of the
   framework included its student-centredness and fostering a sense of
   safety for respondents with potential to improve student-educator
   relationships.DiscussionOur findings suggest that ProFESS enhances
   educators' confidence in managing professional behaviour lapses and that
   its structural flexibility and adaptability underpin its acceptability
   for multidisciplinary educators. Many of its positive attributes address
   the failure to fail barriers. The ProFESS method provides opportunities
   for greater consistency of application as it does not require individual
   interpretation of behaviour but does require education and training to
   apply consistently.ConclusionsThe acceptability of the ProFESS/FfP
   framework in a multidisciplinary healthcare education context is
   promising for integrating support and standards, fostering a safety
   culture for educators and reducing 'failure to fail' barriers.

AB BackgroundThere remains a lack of diversity among those pursuing
   clinical academic careers. Structural inequalities, discrimination and a
   paucity of relatable role models can disadvantage minoritised students,
   hindering their educational experiences and career opportunities.
   Innovative and effective approaches are needed at an undergraduate level
   to address this problem, ensuring the pipeline is representative,
   diverse and inclusive.ApproachTo help address this challenge, in 2021,
   we developed a free online 'medical education masterclass series' for
   250 UK medical students, with students from minoritised backgrounds
   particularly encouraged to apply. The masterclasses explored topical
   themes in medical education through seminars and workshops featuring
   diverse guest speakers.EvaluationTo evaluate the programme, students
   were invited to submit an anonymised reflection and complete a
   semi-structured interview exploring how their perceptions of medical
   education may have changed following attendance of the masterclasses. A
   total of 18% responded, and data were thematically
   analysed.ResultsStudents reflected on how the sessions broadened their
   understanding of medical education beyond their own curriculum
   experiences. Students described acquiring skills and building networks
   to further develop their interest in medical education. The desire to
   make medical education more inclusive was identified as a key priority
   for students, and students felt empowered to advocate for positive
   change within their own institutions.ImplicationsProviding students with
   opportunities to explore medical education through such masterclasses
   has the potential to raise awareness and address some of the barriers
   experienced by minoritised students. We would advocate for similar
   initiatives to be developed in other clinical academic areas to increase
   diversity.

AB BackgroundBalancing autonomy and supervision during medical residency is
   important for trainee development while ensuring patient safety. In the
   increasingly complex inpatient clinical learning environment, tension
   exists when this balance is skewed. In this study, we aimed to
   understand current and ideal states of autonomy and supervision and then
   describe factors that contribute to imbalance from both trainee and
   attending perspectives.MethodsA sequential mixed-methods design included
   surveys and focus groups of trainees and attendings at three
   institutionally affiliated hospitals between May 2019 and June 2020.
   Survey responses were compared using t-tests, chi-square tests or
   Fisher's exact tests. Open-ended survey and focus group data were
   analysed using thematic analysis.FindingsSurvey response rate was 42%
   (76/182) for trainees and 49% (101/208) for attendings. Fourteen
   trainees and 32 attendings participated in 14 focus groups. Trainees
   perceived current culture to be significantly more autonomous than
   attendings; both groups described 'ideal' culture as more autonomous
   than current state. Focus group analysis revealed five core contributors
   to the balance of autonomy and supervision: attending, trainee, patient,
   interpersonal and institutional. These factors were found to be complex
   and interactive and require frequent adjustment to avoid
   tension.ConclusionsTrainees and attendings agree that resident autonomy
   should be prioritized more than it currently is. Attendings, trainees
   and patients contribute to a complex dynamic between autonomy and
   supervision, further impacted by both interpersonal and institutional
   factors, in the inpatient clinical learning environment. Capturing
   complex interactions between individual factors that impact this dynamic
   is critical to understanding and optimization by both trainees and
   attending.

AB BackgroundObjective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) are used
   globally to assess health professional learners' clinical skills and
   applied knowledge. Despite innovations with simulated participants,
   manikin technology and real patient involvement, there remains a gap
   between 'real-life' practice and 'OSCE experience'. For example,
   although mobile phone use is increasingly common in clinical practice;
   however, it would represent a significant disruption to established
   assessment practices in OSCEs. We aimed to explore student use of mobile
   phones during OSCE assessment, with a focus on exam security, equity and
   relevance to practice.MethodsCultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT)
   allows us to conceptualise and analyse complex systems such as those of
   OSCE assessment. We recruited a range of stakeholders in a UK medical
   school setting to participate in focus group interviews exploring our
   stated aim. Transcripts were analysed using CHAT as a theoretical lens
   to construct an activity system of assessment and identify emerging
   tensions around the use of a potentially disruptive technology:
   students' own mobile phones.FindingsSeven examiners, 13 medical
   students, and two simulated participants participated in three focus
   groups. Three sources of tension were identified: between the tools of
   assessment and practice, of exam security and exam relevance, and of
   medical students as people and professionals.Discussion and
   ConclusionThis study exemplifies how a seemingly small disruption in a
   complex system (introducing a mobile phone-a tool used in everyday
   practice) can help us understand and describe the unwritten rules of
   assessment.

AB BackgroundRestorative justice (RJ) is an ethical lens that places
   emphasis on a community's connection and proliferative impact of
   actions, promoting communication and establishing methods for
   accountability. RJ practices can be applied on a spectrum, including
   proactive community-building practices, community discussions in
   response to an event, and restorative conferences addressing specific
   incidences of harm. This article describes an intervention that utilized
   RJ community-building practices within a medical education environment
   and evaluates its acceptability and feasibility.ApproachDuring the
   summer of 2023, RJ interventions were planned, executed and assessed
   within two programmes involving pre-matriculant medical students,
   physician-assistant studies students and undergraduate students. The
   interventions utilized community-building circles within small group
   activities. Capacity building included training for facilitators.
   Ninety-five students participated in the RJ circles.EvaluationEvaluation
   included mixed methods pre- and post-intervention surveys as well as
   qualitative interviews. Ten students (11%) responded to the
   pre-intervention survey, and 17 responded to the post-intervention
   survey (18%). Seven responses were obtained from interviews and
   qualitative surveys. Overall, participant survey responses indicated
   increased feelings of connection and perceptions of mutual understanding
   and that the programme provided adequate space to share one's
   perspective. Qualitative content analysis emphasized community building
   through RJ circles and their ability to promote connection, meaningful
   vulnerability, foster peer support and a desire to continue these
   activities.ImplicationsRJ interventions within medical education
   environments are feasible and show considerable promise. Participants
   consistently noted the benefits of greater connection between peers,
   feelings of support and a desire for these practices to continue.

   ones about the death of a family member is a particularly challenging
   skill that requires specific training. Descriptions of such training are
   lacking in the literature. We developed a formative standardised patient
   encounter on death notification over the telephone for fourth-year
   medical students and evaluated their qualitative perspectives, including
   emotional safety.ApproachEmbedded within a fourth-year advanced
   communication skills workshop in 2019, a case was introduced to practice
   telephone death notification. Students had a preparatory didactic
   lesson, received formative peer feedback, and participated in
   faculty-led debriefs.EvaluationEighty-eight medical students at one
   medical school in the United States participated in debriefing sessions
   after a communication skills workshop during the fourth-year capstone
   course. The debriefing sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed.
   Fifty-seven of those students completed postsession surveys. Transcripts
   and surveys were qualitatively analysed using content analysis to code
   responses, extract salient categories, and distil into themes. Three
   general themes emerged: communication challenges, emotional responses,
   and appreciation for the experience. Communication challenges included
   using language about death, experiences of silence, complications of
   distance and driving, and communication by phone. Students described the
   case as "challenging," "uncomfortable," "intense," and "emotional."
   Despite these strong feelings, students expressed appreciation for the
   experience, noting appropriateness of the preparation and debrief, a
   sense of safety, and realistic encounters.ImplicationsTelephone death
   notification training was a valued, realistic, and emotionally safe
   experience. Students felt appropriately challenged, but adequately
   supported. These skills can be included in formative communication
   skills curricula.

AB BackgroundWith increasing patient care responsibilities, administrative
   work and education demands, physicians may find it challenging to
   provide high-quality and engaging clinical education to third-year
   medical students on clerkships. Fourth-year students in the role of
   near-peer teachers can help fill this role, but they often also have
   competing responsibilities.ApproachA 4-week Internal Medicine Student
   Chief (Student Chief) elective was created, designed such that
   fourth-year students would apply for dedicated time to serve as student
   leaders, coaches and educators for the third-year students on the
   Internal Medicine clerkship. They were provided an asynchronous medical
   education curriculum and conducted their own Medicine subject exam
   reviews, case conferences and feedback sessions.EvaluationCourse
   evaluations by clerkship students did not detect a significant
   difference between the "quality" of the Internal Medicine clerkship and
   the "amount of formative feedback" from pre-post Student Chief elective
   introduction. Clerkship students' feedback regarding their interactions
   with and the ratings of the Student Chief, however, were excellent.
   Evaluations by the Student Chief suggested that the course provided rich
   opportunities for students interested in medical education to learn and
   practice skills in teaching, mentoring and coaching of Internal Medicine
   clerkship students.ImplicationsGiven overwhelmingly positive feedback,
   the Student Chief elective has continued. Student Chief responsibilities
   evolved based on feedback, and the Student Chiefs themselves develop
   their own learning goals for their experience. Future studies could
   include a more longitudinal evaluation of the program, expanding the
   scope of the Student Chief experience to other specialties and
   publication of an implementation toolkit.

   evidence with regards to the unique features of the Type 2 diabetes
   (T2D) pathophysiology, complications, response to therapy with the
   possibility of precision medicine guiding therapeutic decision making in
   Asia.Recent findingsAsia is the epicenter of diabetes. There have been
   marked advances with genotyping and phenotyping of the Asian patient
   with T2D, particularly with young onset diabetes where early beta cell
   failure and rapid progression of complications are more frequent. As
   Asians have lower muscle mass and higher adiposity, sarcopenia is
   increasingly associated with diabetes. Response to lifestyle and
   pharmacotherapy are generally similar, but unique features exist with
   different populations. Across Asia, use of guideline directed medical
   therapy for cardio-renal protection are recommended, but uptake of these
   newer agents are suboptimal and barriers exist with regards to
   standardized care.SummaryAlthough many similarities have been observed
   across Asia, due to the heterogeneity of populations within Asia,
   further research is required to streamline and pave the way towards
   precision medicine. There is an urgent need for region wide consensus to
   minimize barriers to diabetes care and stigma in diabetes terminology
   across Asia.

AB Dengue, a vector-borne disease, affects nearly 400 million people
   annually. Although commercially available dengue NS1 antigen-based ELISA
   kits are simple and rapid, they are expensive as monoclonal antibodies
   are used in these tests, and also, they have short expiry dates. As an
   alternative, the polyclonal antibodies generated against dengue NS1
   antigen from the individuals who recovered from the dengue infection
   (human polyclonal antibodies against dengue; HuPA-D) can be explored for
   the detection of NS1 antigen in the dengue virus (DENV) infected
   patients' sera. In this study, blood samples were collected from the
   dengue-recovered patients after obtaining the IHEC approval. The
   anti-NS1 HuPA-D (IgG) was purified using NAbTM Spin Column kit and
   tested on SDS-PAGE. HuPA-D ELISA was developed to test the sensitivity
   and specificity of the antibodies using the recombinant NS1 antigens of
   dengue serotypes and flaviviruses. Further, the HuPA-D were used to
   detect the sera of the dengue patients. The assay was found to be
   sensitive to detect all the serotypes of recombinant dengue NS1 antigen
   and also NS1 antigen from the sera of DENV infected patients.

   Nasopharyngeal swabs were tested for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B,
   respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus using POCT. The overall
   prevalence of respiratory viruses was 21.2 %, with influenza A being the
   most common (11.4 %). Shorter duration of symptoms and lower lymphocyte
   counts were associated with higher influenza positivity. Patients who
   tested positive for influenza received significantly more antiviral
   therapy (98.1 % vs. 39.4 %, p<0.001) and less antibiotic therapy (1.9 %
   vs. 28.5 %, p<0.001) compared to those who tested negative. The study
   highlights the utility of rapid antigen testing in enhancing antiviral
   and antibiotic stewardship, thereby improving clinical decision-making
   and patient outcomes in resource-limited settings.

AB PurposeUnderweight, i.e. low body mass index for age and sex, may
   indicate undernutrition, but despite high prevalence, this aspect is
   largely overlooked in children in high-income countries. We explored if
   dietary intake, nutrient status, body composition, bone mineralization,
   cardiometabolic markers and school performance differed in
   schoolchildren with underweight compared to normal- and
   overweight.MethodsWe used cross-sectional data from 815 Danish
   8-11-year-old children collected in 2011. Intake of foods,
   macronutrients and key micronutrients (vitamin D, vitamin B12, calcium,
   iron, zinc and selenium) was assessed by 7-day dietary records.
   Measurements included anthropometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
   and tests of attention and reading skills. Fasting blood samples were
   analyzed for biomarkers of iron, long-chain n-3 fatty acids and vitamin
   D status as well as blood lipids, insulin and growth
   markers.ResultsEighty-three (10.2%) children had underweight and were
   shown to have a lower intake of energy, red meat, protein and zinc and
   higher intake of added sugar than children with normal- and overweight.
   They also had higher fish intake relative to overweight, but blood
   biomarkers did not differ between groups. Children with underweight had
   lower fat percent and bone mineralization compared to peers with
   normalweight, but apart from lower insulin, they did not differ in
   overall cardiometabolic health or school performance.ConclusionAlthough
   we found some differences in diet, there were no considerable
   differences in nutrient status, cardiometabolic health or school
   performance between children with underweight and their normalweight
   peers. However, the lower bone mineralization is a concern and needs
   further investigation.

AB Purpose To meet the global dietary protein demands, a trend towards
   plant-based protein (PBP) sources to replace animal-derived protein is
   currently ongoing. However, PBPs may not have the same anabolic capacity
   to stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS) as dairy proteins. For
   vulnerable populations with specific medical needs, it is especially
   important to validate the anabolic properties of PBPs. In this study, a
   blend of pea and soy protein isolate, with or without additional
   leucine, was compared to whey protein isolate on MPS in aged mice.
   Methods 25-Months aged C57BL/6J-mice received an oral gavage with 70 mg
   of whey protein isolate (W), PS protein isolate (PS; ratio 51:49), PS
   fortified with 19% leucine (PS + L), or 0.5mL water (F). Mice were
   subcutaneously injected with puromycin (0.04 mu mol/g body weight, t =
   30 min) and sacrificed 60 min thereafter. Left m. tibialis anterior (TA)
   was used to analyse MPS by the SUnSET method and mTOR signal
   transduction proteins. Amino acid concentrations were determined in
   plasma and right TA. Dried blood spots (DBS) were analysed for
   postprandial dynamics of amino acids at 10-20-45-60-min. Results MPS was
   significantly increased by W and PS + L (p < 0.003), however not by PS.
   Pathway protein 4EBP1 showed significant increases with W, PS and PS + L
   to F (p < 0.0002). W and PS + L increased plasma and muscle free leucine
   equally, which was confirmed by DBS. Conclusion A PS blend fortified
   with leucine stimulates MPS comparable to whey protein in this acute
   murine ageing model. Leucine appears to be the main driver for the
   anabolic responses observed.

AB ObjectivesThe potential association between oral health and nutritional
   status of the very old, has been poorly investigated. Thus, we carried
   out the cross-sectional study to evaluate the association of oral health
   with the nutritional status of the older adults.Methods210 participants
   aged over 75 years were included in the study. Nutritional status was
   assessed by the Short-form Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA-SF) and body
   composition measurement. Data were available for self-reported oral
   health (10-item Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) and Chewing Function
   Questionnaire (CFQ)) and specific experimental tests including salivary
   flow, tongue and lip pressure, occlusal force, water swallow test and
   taste test for the detection of oral functions. Spearman rank
   correlation was used to analyze the correlation between body composition
   and oral health. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models
   were applied to examine the association of oral health with
   malnutrition.ResultsThe study reveals that poor oral health is related
   to the malnutrition. The tongue pressure and molar occlusal force were
   significantly associated with malnutrition in an L-shaped dose-response
   relationship after adjustment for potential confounding factors. The
   higher the tongue pressure and molar occlusal force, the lower the risk
   of malnutrition. Besides, the CFQ score, salty, sour, and bitter taste,
   are risk factors for malnutrition.ConclusionsThe presence of
   malnutrition is significantly associated with poor oral health in older
   adults. Our study supposes that the design of food suitable for oral
   conditions of the older adults may be another feasible solution to the
   nutritional problems among them.

AB PurposeNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most severe
   gastrointestinal disease in preterm infants caused by an exaggerated
   intestinal epithelial immune activation. Several studies show that
   modulation of toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) activity may have positive
   effects on preventing intestinal inflammatory mechanisms ultimately
   resulting in NEC development. In this study, the effect of various
   infant formulas (IF) and the probiotic strain Limosilactobacillus
   fermentum CECT5716 on TLR9 activation were analyzed in
   vitro.MethodsFirst, TLR4 and TLR9 expression was analyzed on human
   primary intestinal epithelial cells (P-IECs) by qPCR and Western blot
   analysis. Then genetically designed HEK-Dual (TM) hTLR9 (NF/IL8)
   reporter cells (HEK-Dual) were treated with different IFs, L. fermentum
   CECT5716, and different functional components to measure TLR9 activation
   via luminescence. Finally, the IFs were investigated in P-IECs to
   analyze TLR downstream signaling by Western blot analysis.ResultsIFs
   containing intact protein and L. fermentum CECT5716 activated TLR9 in
   HEK-Dual cells, but the functional components lactoferrin,
   L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and hydrolyzed whey proteins failed to
   activate TLR9. In P-IECs, the IFs induced increased phosphorylation of
   MAPK8/9 of the TLR signaling pathway and significantly reduced IL6
   levels. Consistently, IL6 levels were increased in P-IECs when
   TLR9-signaling was inhibited. Interestingly, L. fermentum CECT5716
   enhanced TLR9-signaling and increased NF-kappa-B inhibitor
   alpha-phosphorylation.ConclusionWe found out that the used control
   formula, prebiotic formula, prebiotic formula with hydrolyzed-protein,
   and L. fermentum CECT5716 reduce IL6 levels in human P-IECs through TLR9
   activation. L. fermentum CECT5716 and the here tested IFs could be a
   promising approach for modulation of gut health in infants.

AB PurposeVitamin K is an activator of vitamin K dependent proteins, one of
   which is the potent inhibitor of vascular calcification, matrix Gla
   protein (MGP). The purpose of this study is to investigate the
   association between an inverse proxy of functional vitamin K status,
   plasma dephospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP), and cardiovascular
   disease risk factors (CVDRFs).MethodsIn a cross-sectional
   population-based health examination study of 4,092 individuals aged
   24-77 years, the vitamin K status was assessed using plasma dp-ucMGP.
   All participants were linked to Danish National Prescription Register to
   obtain information on the use of vitamin K antagonists. The associations
   between log2 transformed dp-ucMGP values and CVDRFs were determined
   using regression models adjusted for sex, age, lifestyle factors, kidney
   function and waist circumference.ResultsHigher dp-ucMGP levels were
   associated with increased risk of central obesity (Odds Ratio (OR) 4.76,
   95% Confidence Intervals (CI) 3.57-6.34), diabetes (OR 1.96, 95% CI
   1.11-3.45), hyperlipidaemia (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.01-2.03), and impaired
   kidney function (OR 9.83, 95% CI 5.49-17.59) per doubling in dp-ucMGP.
   Dp-ucMGP was not independently associated with hypertension or arterial
   stiffness.ConclusionHigher dp-ucMGP levels were associated with central
   obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, and impaired kidney function.
   Prospective studies and intervention studies examining the effects of
   improving vitamin K status are needed to clarify the potential role of
   vitamin K in relation to these CVDRFs.

AB PurposeDietary habit significantly contributes to the initiation and
   progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Dietary choices intersect with
   a range of clinical and societal factors. The utilization of
   cross-sectional methodologies in numerous studies poses a challenge in
   establishing definitive causality for the noted associations. Moreover,
   within identical food categories, specific items may elicit diverse
   effects on the pathogenesis of RA, and the correlation between several
   prevalent food items or beverages and RA remains inadequately
   explored.MethodsWe performed a two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR)
   study to evaluate the causal impact of 27 distinct dietary habits and RA
   susceptibility. These dietary-related phenotypes encompass both the
   relative intake of the four macronutrients (fat, protein, carbohydrates,
   and sugar) and 23 specific single food intake. Several filtering steps
   were employed to select eligible genetic instruments strongly associated
   with each of the traits. The random-effects inverse-variance weighted,
   weighted median, and MR-Egger methods were employed for MR estimations.
   Sensitivity analyses and power calculations were executed to ensure the
   robustness of our study.ResultsAfter rigorous single-nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) filtering procedures, 611 SNPs were included in our
   ongoing investigations. The consumption of dried fruit, bread, and
   alcohol emerged as protective factors, while beef, processed meat, and
   coffee intake were identified as risk factors. The robustness of our
   study was confirmed through the outcomes of sensitivity analysis and
   power calculation.ConclusionThe ongoing investigations furnish evidence
   that accentuates the influence of diet on RA disease activity,
   underscoring the importance of delineating the optimal nutritional
   lifestyle for RA patients.

AB PurposeCarbohydrate intake has been linked to colorectal cancer (CRC)
   risk, with variations depending on the quantity and quality of
   carbohydrates consumed. This study aimed to investigate the association
   between carbohydrate quantity and quality, using the low-carbohydrate
   diet score (LCD) and carbohydrate quality index (CQI), and the risk of
   CRC in the Chinese population.MethodsWe conducted a case-control study
   in Guangzhou, China, with 2,799 CRC cases and an equal number of sex-
   and age-matched controls. Dietary data were collected using a validated
   food frequency questionnaire to derive the LCD and CQI, assessing the
   quantity and quality of carbohydrate intake separately. Odds ratios (OR)
   and 95% confidence interval (CI) for CRC risk were estimated using
   unconditional logistic regression models, and restricted cubic splines
   were used to explore potential non-linear relationships.ResultsThe
   results demonstrated that higher adherence to the overall LCD score,
   plant-based LCD score, and CQI was associated with a lower risk of CRC.
   The adjusted ORs (95%CIs) for the highest quintile of intake in
   comparison with the lowest quintile were 0.76 (0.63, 0.91) for the
   overall LCD score, 0.61 (0.50, 0.74) for the plant-based LCD score, and
   0.70 (0.58,0.84) for the CQI, respectively. However, the animal-based
   LCD did not show a significant association with CRC risk, with the
   adjusted OR (95%CI) for the highest quintile compared to the lowest
   being 0.98 (0.81, 1.18). Restricted cubic splines analysis showed
   non-linear associations of the overall LCD score, animal-based LCD
   score, and plant-based LCD score with CRC risk. In contrast, a linear
   relationship was observed between CQI and CRC risk (Pnonlinear =
   0.594).ConclusionsOur findings indicate that the overall LCD score, the
   plant-based LCD score, and the CQI were inversely associated with the
   risk of CRC.

AB PurposePharmacological inhibition of ferroptosis, a specific form of
   regulated cell death, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy
   for alleviating symptoms and enhancing endoscopic outcomes in patients
   suffering from ulcerative colitis. Rhoifolin, a prominent bioactive
   constituent abundant in the widely consumed fruit Citrus grandis
   (grapefruit), has garnered attention for its ability to diminish the
   levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are key inducers of
   ferroptosis across diverse cellular contexts. In this study, we aimed to
   investigate whether rhoifolin exerts its beneficial effects on colitis
   by modulating the process of epithelial ferroptosis.MethodsColitis model
   was successfully established in C57BL/6 mice through the administration
   of 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) solution for a duration of 9 days,
   which was freely accessible for drinking. RNA sequencing was conducted
   to delve into the mechanisms underlying the rhoifolin-mediated effects
   on colitis. To evaluate the impact of rhoifolin on ferroptosis in
   epithelial cells, several key indicators were measured, including
   mitochondrial morphology, colonic glutathione (GSH) levels, lipid
   peroxidation product contents, and ROS levels.ResultsThe results
   indicated that rhoifolin exhibited profound anti-colitis properties and
   effectively curbs ferroptosis in epithelial cells of mice subjected to
   DSS treatment. The RNA sequencing analysis further revealed that
   rhoifolin stimulated a remarkable upregulation of colonic cell
   migration-inducing protein (CEMIP) expression by approximately 2.4-fold
   in colitis-affected mice. Notably, depletion of CEMIP significantly
   blocked the rhoifolin-induced increase in the cystine transporter solute
   carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11, from 1.9-fold to approximately
   1.1-fold), as well as the elevation of cystine uptake (from 1.72-fold to
   1.2-fold) and glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis (from 2.1-fold to
   1.2-fold), and the suppression of epithelial ferroptosis (from 0.51-fold
   to 0.94-fold) in mice with colitis. Molecular docking investigations
   have pinpointed crucial amino acid residues within CEMIP, specifically
   His267, His289, and Phe265, as the primary interaction sites (docking
   score: -7.8 kcal/mol), facilitating the engagement of rhoifolin via
   hydrogen bonding interactions.ConclusionRhoifolin significantly
   mitigated DSS-induced colitis primarily through inhibiting epithelial
   ferroptosis. The activation of CEMIP by citrus-derived rhoifolin led to
   a notable upregulation of SLC7A11 expression, thereby enhanced cystine
   uptake and facilitated GSH biosynthesis, ultimately suppressed the
   occurrence of ferroptosis in epithelial cells.

AB Background Multiple diet patterns play a crucial role in the development
   of colorectal cancer and its precursor, colorectal adenoma, but
   mediating effect of plasma metabolite profiles is unclear. Methods A
   total of 95,275 participants from UK Biobank with plasma metabolomics
   and dietary information were analyzed. Metabolite profile scores for 14
   dietary patterns were estimated through elastic net regression. Cox
   regression analysis assessed the associations of dietary patterns and
   their metabolite profile scores with colorectal tumor risk. Mediating
   effects of identified metabolite profile scores were estimated in the
   associations. Results Fourteen metabolite profile scores, including a
   range of 28 to 205 signatures, were weak to moderate correlation with
   dietary patterns (all p < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression analyses
   revealed that five dietary patterns were significantly correlated with a
   decreased risk of colorectal tumor after FDR correction and adjustment
   for covariates. HRs (95% CIs) per 1 SD for these diet patterns were as
   follows: WCRF (0.93, 0.90-0.96), CRC score (0.94, 0.92-0.97), AHEI-2010
   (0.95, 0.92-0.97), DASH (0.94, 0.91-0.97), and hPDI (0.95, 0.93-0.98).
   Similarly, metabolite profile scores for these five dietary patterns
   were inversely associated with colorectal tumor risk, with HRs (95% CIs)
   per 1 SD as follows: WCRF (0.59, 0.49-0.70), CRC score (0.67,
   0.58-0.77), AHEI-2010 (0.73, 0.65-0.80), DASH (0.75, 0.66-0.84), and
   hPDI (0.56, 0.47-0.67). The mediation proportions of five metabolite
   profile scores between dietary patterns and colorectal tumor risk ranged
   from 6.37 to 27.23% (all p < 0.001). Conclusions Five dietary patterns
   and their metabolite profile scores, were inversely correlated with
   colorectal tumor risk. These findings highlight the potential of
   metabolite profiles as mediators in the association between dietary
   patterns and the risk of colorectal tumor, further contributing to the
   prevention of colorectal cancer or adenoma and providing new insights
   for future research.

AB PurposeAlthough (poly)phenols have shown potential in anti-cancer
   activities, their impact on improving ovarian cancer (OC) survival
   remains unknown. Therefore, we aim to first investigate the association
   between dietary polyphenol intake and OC survival, providing valuable
   insights into potential interventions.MethodsThe prospective cohort
   recruited 560 patients with OC to assess the associations of polyphenol
   intake, not only pre- and post-diagnosis but also the change from pre-
   to post-diagnosis with OC survival. Dietary intakes of total
   (poly)phenols and their five classes (flavonoids, phenolic acids,
   lignans, stilbenes, and other polyphenols) were assessed using a
   validated 111-item food frequency questionnaire. Overall survival (OS)
   was tracked through active follow-up and medical records until February
   16th, 2023. Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to
   calculate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals
   (CI).ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 44.4 months, 211 all-cause
   deaths were identified. We observed significant associations between
   higher polyphenol intake with lower risk of mortality among patients
   with OC ((HR T3 vs. T1 = 0.55, 95%CI = 0.35-0.87 for pre-diagnosis; and
   HR T3 vs. T1 = 0.59, 95%CI = 0.39-0.90 for post-diagnosis).
   Consistently, an evident linear trend was observed for polyphenol and
   flavonoid intake with OC survival. Of note, compared to the stable group
   (change within 10%), the decreased intake (change of more than 10%) of
   total (poly)phenols and five polyphenol classes was significantly
   associated with worse OS.ConclusionDietary (poly)phenols, as well as its
   five classes, have an inverse association with OC survival.

AB PurposeWe designed and evaluated food-based dietary recommendations for
   12-24-mo-old New Zealand children with linear and goal programming
   models taking into account intakes of all nutrients
   concurrently.MethodsDietary data used to define model parameters (food
   list, food quantities consumed, and food consumption patterns from 3-d
   weighed food records) were collected from 12-24-mo-old New Zealand
   toddlers (n = 188). Linear and goal programming models were developed to
   design and evaluate three sets of recommendations: (1) using all foods
   consumed by toddlers; (2) excluding commercial infant/toddler foods; and
   (3) excluding both commercial infant/toddler foods and all
   iron-fortified foods.ResultsFood-based dietary recommendations for
   toddlers were developed which aligned with observed food consumption
   patterns: Non-Sweet Cereals: 3 serves/d, Vegetables: 2 serves/d, Fruit:
   2 serves/d, Dairy: 2 serves/d, and Meat/Fish/Poultry/Eggs/Legumes/Nuts:
   2 serves/d. However, they only ensured adequate intakes of all nutrients
   modeled if approximate to 500 g/d of iron-fortified toddler milk was
   also recommended. Food-based dietary recommendations that excluded
   commercial infant/toddler foods or excluded both commercial
   infant/toddler foods and all iron-fortified foods would not ensure
   adequate intakes of iron and folate, for all children. The lowest
   intakes, in simulated intake distributions for these nutrients, were <=
   29% and <= 38% of their nutrient reference values,
   respectively.ConclusionsFood-based dietary recommendations which
   successfully promote the consumption of 3 serves/d of Non-Sweet Cereals,
   2 serves/d of Vegetables, 2 serves/d of Fruit, 2 serves/d of Dairy
   (including approximate to 500 g/d of iron-fortified toddler milk), and 2
   serves/d of Meat/Fish/Poultry/Eggs/Legumes/Nuts should ensure all New
   Zealand toddlers meet their requirements for the 15 nutrients modeled.

AB Background Diet is an essential modifiable determinant of bone health,
   yet the associations between dietary patterns (DPs) and bone mineral
   density (BMD) in Chinese children remain limited. Objective This study
   aimed to investigate the relationship between overall diet and low BMD
   risk among school-aged children in China. Methods A total of 1,099
   children aged 9-12 in China were recruited for this cross-sectional
   study. A semi-quantified food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used to
   assess dietary intake. A priori numerical index, the Chinese Dietary
   Guidelines Index for Children and Adolescents [CDGI (2021)-C] was
   utilized to assess dietary quality. Specific DPs were identified by
   using principal components analysis (PCA). The BMD of the left forearm
   was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Spearman
   correlation test was conducted to investigate the associations between
   DPs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and restricted cubic
   spline models (RCS) were applied to explore the associations between DPs
   and BMD. Results Three distinct DPs were identified: the plant-animal
   balanced pattern, the grain-tuber-meat pattern, and the bean-dairy
   pattern. We found a weak but significant positive correlation of the
   CDGI (2021)-C with the plant-animal balanced pattern (R = 0.318, P <
   0.001), and with the bean-dairy pattern (R = 0.266, P < 0.001),
   respectively. After adjusting for covariates, adherence to the CDGI
   (2021)-C (Q4 vs. Q1, OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.27-0.75), the plant-animal
   balanced pattern (Q4 vs. Q1, OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.31-0.81), and the
   bean-dairy pattern (Q3 vs. Q1, OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.33-0.96) were
   associated with a lower risk of low BMD. No significant association was
   observed between the grain-tuber-meat pattern and low BMD (Q4 vs. Q1, OR
   = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.90-1.31). Conclusion Adherence to the CDGI (2021)-C
   and the plant-animal balanced pattern is advantageous for bone health
   and inversely correlated with the risk of low BMD among school-aged
   children in China. Additionally, moderate adherence to the bean-dairy
   pattern may also confer benefits to bone health. A balanced and overall
   healthy diet should be recommended in our daily life.

AB Purpose Diet rich in antioxidant may protect against chronic respiratory
   disease (CRD), but few studies have evaluated the association between
   composite dietary antioxidant index (CDAI) and CRD. The study aimed to
   examine the association of CDAI with the risk of CRD and all-cause
   mortality in CRD patients from the US. Methods Data were obtained from
   the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003-2018.
   Logistic and Cox regression analyses were used to estimate association
   of CDAI with CRD and all-cause mortality. Dose-response relationship was
   examined by restricted cubic spline analyses. Results Total 44,094
   participants were eligible for CRD (aged 1-85 years; mean age: 45.71
   years old), and 7,685 CRD patients for all-cause mortality (median
   follow-up: 7.58 years; 1,136 deaths before 12/31/2019). The risk for
   CRD, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was significantly
   decreased by 13-32% with the increase intake of CDAI, even after
   adjusting for confounders (all P < 0.001). The relationship between CDAI
   and three respiratory endpoints was U-shaped (all P for nonlinearity <
   0.001). There was an obvious declining trend in the magnitude of
   mortality risk with the increase of intake of CDAI, especially in
   patients with asthma. Fully adjusted hazard ratio was 0.72 (95%
   confidence interval: 0.54-0.95), 0.55 (0.42-0.72), and 0.48 (0.34-0.66)
   for the second, third, and fourth quartile of CDAI in patients with
   asthma relative to the first quartile, respectively. The association
   with CRD risk was significantly modified by smoking status
   (P-interaction: 0.006). Conclusion Our findings indicate that high CDAI
   is a significant protective factor against CRD and all-cause mortality
   in the US population.

AB Neurological disorders encompassing both central nervous system (CNS)
   diseases and peripheral nerve injuries (PNI), represent significant
   challenges in modern clinical practice. Conditions such as stroke,
   spinal cord injuries, and carpal tunnel syndrome can cause debilitating
   impairments, leading to reduced quality of life and placing a heavy
   burden on healthcare systems. Current treatment strategies, including
   pharmacological interventions and surgical procedures, often yield
   limited results, and many patients experience suboptimal outcomes or
   treatment- associated risks. In light of these limitations, there is a
   growing interest in exploring non-invasive therapeutic alternatives.
   Among these, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has eme rged as a
   promising modality, demonstrating efficacy in musculoskeletal conditions
   and gaining attention for its potential role in neurological disorders.
   This manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the cellular
   and molecular mechanisms underlying ESWT, focusing on its therapeutic
   applications in CNS diseases and PNI, thereby shedding light on its
   potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for neurological
   conditions.

AB Rapid and sensitive detection of dopamine (DA) concentration in body and
   food is of great significance for the prevention of neurological
   diseases. Herein, Mo-doped CoP nanoparticles embedded bamboo-like
   nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube-modified hollow nanocages are prepared
   using Mo-ZIF-8@ZIF-67 as a self-sacrificing template. The hollow
   nanostructures modified by carbon nanotubes provide a large specific
   surface area and abundant active sites. The doping of Mo and N can
   adjust the electronic structure of the catalyst and improve its
   electrocatalytic oxidation ability. As a DA sensor, it exhibits a good
   two-stage linear range (1 mu M to 50 mu M and 50 mu M to 300 mu M),
   respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) is 55 nM (S/N = 3). The
   sensor has been successfully applied to the determination of DA in human
   serum and beef samples with recoveries of 97.0 %-106.1 % and RSD <4.1 %,
   which has great application potential in the field of DA detection.

AB Intent inferral on a hand orthosis for stroke patients is challenging
   due to the difficulty of data collection. Additionally, EMG signals
   exhibit significant variations across different conditions, sessions,
   and subjects, making it hard for classifiers to generalize. Traditional
   approaches require a large labeled dataset from the new condition,
   session, or subject to train intent classifiers; however, this data
   collection process is burdensome and time-consuming. In this letter, we
   propose ChatEMG, an autoregressive generative model that can generate
   synthetic EMG signals conditioned on prompts (i.e., a given sequence of
   EMG signals). ChatEMG enables us to collect only a small dataset from
   the new condition, session, or subject and expand it with synthetic
   samples conditioned on prompts from this new context. ChatEMG leverages
   a vast repository of previous data via generative training while still
   remaining context-specific via prompting. Our experiments show that
   these synthetic samples are classifier-agnostic and can improve intent
   inferral accuracy for different types of classifiers. We demonstrate
   that our complete approach can be integrated into a single patient
   session, including the use of the classifier for functional
   orthosis-assisted tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   time an intent classifier trained partially on synthetic data has been
   deployed for functional control of an orthosis by a stroke survivor.

AB Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors block pathways involved in inflammation
   and immune response, making JAK inhibitors useful in the treatment of
   various diseases. While the efficacy of these drugs has been proven in
   several studies, their safety profile needs to be further investigated.
   In this systematic review and metaanalysis, we examined the risk of
   infections during treatment with oral JAK inhibitors with no concomitant
   treatment compared to placebo in phase 2 and 3 randomized,
   placebo-controlled trials. The medical databases PubMed, Web of Science,
   and EMBASE were searched from inception through February 2024, yielding
   13,567 nonduplicate articles, of which 69 were included in the final
   quantitative analysis. Overall, we found that treatment with oral JAK
   inhibitors was associated with an increased risk of infections compared
   to placebo across all indications (relative risk: 1.39 [95% CI:
   1.096-1.76, P = .0067]) and in dermatologic indications (relative risk:
   1.46 [95% CI, 1.10-1.93, P = .0097]). Remarkably, an increased risk of
   herpes zoster infections was found in dermatologic indications but not
   in nondermatologic indications. In conclusion, we identified a
   significantly increased risk of developing infections during treatment
   with oral JAK inhibitors compared to placebo across indications. In
   sub-analyses, we additionally found an increased risk of herpes zoster
   in dermatologic indications. ( JAAD Int 2025;18:106-16.)

AB Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified
   numerous variants associated with psychiatric disorders. However, it
   remains largely unknown on how GWAS risk variants contribute to
   psychiatric disorders. Methods: Through integrating two largest,
   publicly available, independent protein quantitative trait loci datasets
   of plasma protein and nine large-scale GWAS summary statistics of
   psychiatric disorders, we first performed proteome-wide association
   study (PWAS) to identify psychiatric disorders-associated plasma
   proteins, followed by enrichment analysis to reveal the underlying
   biological processes and pathways. Then, we conducted Mendelian
   randomization (MR) and Bayesian colocalization (COLOC) analyses, with
   both discovery and parallel replication datasets, to further identify
   protein-disorder pairs with putatively causal relationships. We finally
   prioritized the potential drug targets using Drug Gene Interaction
   Database. Results: PWAS totally identified 112 proteins, which were
   significantly enriched in biological processes relevant to immune
   regulation and response to stimulus including regulation of immune
   system process (adjusted P = 1.69 x 10- 7) and response to external
   stimulus (adjusted P = 4.13 x 10- 7), and viral infection related
   pathways, including COVID-19 (adjusted P = 2.94 x 10- 2). MR and COLOC
   analysis further identified 26 potentially causal protein-disorder pairs
   in both discovery and replication analysis. Notably, eight
   protein-coding genes were immune-related, such as IRF3, CSK, and ACE,
   five among 16 druggable genes were reported to interact with drugs,
   including ACE, CSK, PSMB4, XPNPEP1, and MICB. Conclusions: Our findings
   highlighted the immunological hypothesis and identified potentially
   causal plasma proteins for psychiatric disorders, providing biological
   insights into the pathogenesis and benefit the development of preventive
   or therapeutic drugs for psychiatric disorders.

AB Objective: Childhood trauma is a significant environmental stressor
   linked to mood disorder. It can affect not only the individuals directly
   involved but also the next generation through the intergenerational
   transmission of trauma. This study aimed to investigate, for the first
   time, the co-occurrence of childhood trauma in youths with mood
   disorders and their parents. Methods: We assessed 443 individuals, 100
   youths with DSM-5 mood disorders, 100 youths healthy controls (HCs), 92
   s' parents and 161 adult HCs. History of childhood trauma was obtained
   using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The distribution
   patterns of childhood trauma subtypes was estimated through a
   multivariate model. Intraclass correlations (ICC) were calculated to
   account for the familial clustering of the sample. Results: We found
   significantly higher scores for Patients as compared to Young-HC in all
   the subtypes of childhood trauma (p < 0.05). Considering Parents and
   Adult-HC groups, Physical abuse (p = 0.001) and Emotional neglect showed
   higher scores in Parents (p < 0.001). Regarding the familial clustering
   of the sample, emotional (p < 0.001) and sexual abuse (p = 0.001), and
   emotional (p = 0.3) and physical neglect (p = 0.003) showed statistical
   significance, but only emotional abuse reveled a medium level ICC
   (0.25). Conclusions: Our study highlights the effect of
   intergenerational transmission of childhood trauma on the diagnosis of
   mood disorders in youths. Our findings underscore the significance of
   systematically assessing childhood trauma, in particular emotional
   abuse, in youths with mood disorders and their parents. Additionally,
   there is urgent need for evidence-based preventive measures aimed at
   promoting positive parenting strategies and emotionally supportive
   environments for children.

   Study selection: Population-based cohort studies investigating family
   dysfunction and adolescent suicidal behavior. Data extraction and
   synthesis: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed
   following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-
   analysis guidelines. The review protocol was prospectively registered in
   PROSPERO. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % CIs were derived from
   meta-analysis using STATA 17.0, and subgroup and sensitivity analyses
   were performed. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was
   adolescent suicide symptoms. Measured by database data records, suicide
   scales, or adolescent self-reports. Results: 12 cohort studies were
   included, with sample sizes ranging from 352 to 618,970 individuals.
   Adolescents experiencing family dysfunction a substantially higher risk
   of suicidal behaviors than those in the normal family functioning
   (pooled OR = 1.94; 95 % CI: 1.73-2.16). Specifically, parental suicide
   or attempted suicide had the greatest impact on adolescent suicidal
   behavior (OR = 2.70, 95 % CI:2.12-3.29) compared with parental mental
   disorders, imprisonment of a parent or family member. Conclusions and
   relevance: Family dysfunction, especially parental suicide or attempted
   suicide, is associated with an increased risk of adolescent suicidal
   behavior. The results of this study suggest that early screening and
   intervention for family functioning is important in preventing
   adolescent suicide.

AB Background This study investigates the effects of lean management
   practices on nurses' direct patient care activities and the
   interruptions they encounter in healthcare settings. The literature
   indicates that lean management enhances efficiency and improves patient
   care. Increased nursing time per patient correlates with better
   outcomes; however, rising patient loads and frequent interruptions
   hinder nurses' ability to deliver effective care, jeopardising patient
   safety. Addressing these inefficiencies is essential, given nurses'
   critical role in ensuring quality care. Method Using a single-centre,
   observational, pre-post time and motion design alongside participatory
   action research from August 2019 to July 2022, the study included three
   phases: a survey assessing nurses' views on problem-solving and lean
   management; observations identifying nurses' activities and
   interruptions; and focus group discussions. The results presented here
   are from the observation phase, with 34 nurses from surgical, internal
   medicine, and mixed services participating. Quantitative variables were
   expressed as means, standard deviations, and significance was assessed
   at a 95% confidence interval (p < 0.05). Results Observations in 2019
   (324 h) and 2022 (314 h) revealed that nurses dedicated a significant
   portion of their time to direct patient care, which increased post-lean
   implementation (surgical: 50.67%, internal: 50.09%, mixed: 44.38%).
   Waste rates decreased by 35.81%, and documentation time decreased by
   23.55%. Overall interruptions also decreased significantly (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion Lean management effectively reduces waste and improves direct
   patient care time, enhancing patient safety and care quality. Continuous
   improvement initiatives in nursing practices are essential for success.

AB Objective: Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer in Brazil.
   Although rare, its diagnosis during pregnancy represents a great
   challenge for the medical team and the patient. The objective of this
   study was to evaluate the maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant
   women who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and
   paclitaxel for advanced stage cervical cancer. Methods: This was a
   descriptive, retrospective study that included pregnant women with
   advanced stage cervical cancer (IB3 a IIIC1) who were treated at our
   center over 12 years. These patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy
   with carboplatin plus paclitaxel during pregnancy to prevent disease
   progression. Results: Tumor shrinkage of at least 50 % was observed in
   four patients, while the disease remained stable in three others. There
   was one case of fetal death without apparent cause at 29 weeks, but all
   other mothers were discharged from the hospital at the same time as
   their healthy newborns. Conclusion: Chemotherapy with carboplatin and
   paclitaxel administered to pregnant women with advanced stage cervical
   cancer (IB3- IIIC1) may have prevented disease progression without
   worsening neonatal outcomes.

AB Introduction: To evaluate patients acute cerebral ischemia in order to
   assess for factors which may help to differentiate patients with small
   vessel involvement from those with large vessel involvement in an effort
   to determine diagnostic yield of vascular imaging. Material and Method:
   We prospectively and consecutively evaluated all acute ischemic stroke
   patients at our medical center from May 16, 2021 to December 10, 2021.
   Distinction between small vessel and large vessel involvement was based
   upon clinical presentation, the results of brain imaging and either
   computed tomographic angiography, in the vast majority, or magnetic
   resonance angiography. Patient demographics and risk factors for stroke
   as well as therapeutic intervention was assessed. Conclusion and Result:
   Of the 90 patients studied, 59 had large vessel ischemia (66%) with 26
   (44%) having large vessel occlusion and one had symptomatic high-grade
   middle cerebral artery stenosis. Conversely, none of the 31 patients
   with small vessel presentation (34%) had large vessel occlusion or
   high-grade stenosis. In addition, 19 out of 59 (32%) large vessel
   patients compared to 2 of 31 (6%) of the small vessel patients had
   atrial fibrillation identified as a potential mechanism with a p-value
   of 0.01 by univariate analysis and 0.17 by multivariate analysis. The
   routine use of vascular imaging in acute ischemic stroke is of very low
   yield in small vessel presentation with the presence of potential
   cardiogenic emboli is also relatively low. Efforts at accelerated
   identification of a small vessel mechanism, to avoid unnecessary
   testing, should provide significant value from both a patient management
   and cost standpoint.

AB Introduction: Amidst an ongoing surge of opioid use disorder (OUD)
   incidence, clinicians and policymakers are seeking partnerships with
   faith communities - including with faith-affiliated treatment centers
   (FATCs) - to expand access to evidence-based OUD treatment. However,
   little is known whether FATCs differentially offer such evidence-based
   treatment services, particularly medications for opioid use disorder
   (MOUD) and cooccurring mental health care. Methods: We use the 2021
   National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey (N-SUMHSS) to
   examine differences in provision of several OUD services, including
   MOUD, psychological treatments, mental health services, medical
   services, recovery support services, and services related to treatment
   accessibility, between self- identified FATCs and non-FATCs. We also
   explored differences in characteristics related to insurance, licensure,
   and accreditation. Results: FATCs were less likely than non-FATCs to
   offer almost all measure of MOUD and more likely to refuse to accept
   clients who use MOUD. They were also less likely to report using
   telemedicine. However, they were more likely to offer residential
   treatment, Twelve Step facilitation, and transitional housing. We find
   little evidence that FATCs offer co-occurring mental health treatments
   at different rates than non-FATCs. Conclusion: More research is needed
   to examine the factors that drive these differences, especially in MOUD
   and transitional housing. When partnering with FATCs, clinicians and
   policymakers should seek common ground with FATCs and recognize the
   philosophies, values, and concerns that may potentially be driving these
   differences.

AB Background: Cognitive profiles of individuals with opioid use disorder
   (OUD) limit patients' ability to learn, retain, and recall HIV
   prevention information. It also limits adherence to medications, such as
   pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Cognitive dysfunction accommodation
   strategies have shown promise at reducing HIVrelated risk behaviors
   among individuals with OUD and increasing adherence to PrEP. This study
   investigated the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of
   integrating accommodation strategies into a behavioral HIV prevention
   intervention. Methods: This 2-arm single blind study provided 50 people
   who inject drugs (PWID) with OUD linkage to PrEP services and randomized
   them to a 4-week HIV prevention intervention condition. The active
   control condition received the HIV prevention intervention as treatment
   per usual, while the experimental condition received the enhanced HIV
   prevention intervention with added accommodation strategies.
   Participants completed acceptability ratings of intervention content and
   accommodation strategies post-intervention; feasibility was measured via
   participant recruitment and retention. HIV risk reduction information,
   motivation, and behavior (IMB) assessments and HIV risk reduction skills
   assessments were completed pre/post-intervention. Participants also
   completed weekly PrEP adherence assessments. Results: The intervention
   content received a high acceptability rating (89 %). Intervention
   feasibility was deemed acceptable, with 80 % of participants completing
   all study protocols. The accommodation strategies integrated into the
   HIV prevention sessions were also endorsed by 92 % of participants.
   Participants in the experimental condition had significant increases in
   retention and recall of how to perform HIV risk reduction skills
   including how to properly clean a syringe (p = 0.048) and how to
   accurately apply a female condom (p = 0.025), compared to the control
   condition. Weekly PrEP adherence was reported by the three (7.5 %)
   participants who indicated taking PrEP throughout the study. All three
   participants reported missing doses throughout each of the 4 weeks.
   Conclusions: Results from this study highlight the potential for
   integrating accommodation strategies into behavioral HIV prevention
   interventions to reduce the risk of HIV among PWID. Future research is
   needed to evaluate the use of such strategies by larger and diverse
   samples of PWID, as well as whether accommodation strategies enable the
   retention and recall of HIV prevention information and HIV prevention
   skills over longer periods of time. Trial registration: This trial has
   been retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on June 12, 2023.

AB Background: Alcohol use disorder, unemployment, and risk of homelessness
   are linked and often co-occurring, but most interventions do not address
   both alcohol use disorder and unemployment. The Abstinence- Contingent
   Wage Supplement (ACWS) model of the Therapeutic Workplace offers
   participants stipends or wage supplements contingent on both their
   abstaining from alcohol and engaging with an employment specialist or
   working in a community job. Wearable biosensors continuously tracked
   alcohol use. Methods and data: The study randomized participants to
   Usual Care (UC) (n = 57) and ACWS (n = 62). We used micro-costing
   methods to identify the resources and costs of the 6-month ACWS
   intervention. The study team tracked the cost of incentives for wearing
   biosensors, stipends, and wage supplements. We used 6-month cost and
   effectiveness data to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
   and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Results: Over the 6-month
   study period, average intervention costs per participant were $7282,
   with contingent stipends and wage supplements accounting for 50 % of
   intervention costs. We also reported average per participant costs for
   healthcare (UC: $17,785; ACWS: $26,734), justice system (UC: $131; ACWS:
   $153), and public welfare (UC: $1107; ACWS: $1275). The incremental
   cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) at 6 months were $80,911 for an
   additional participant abstinent, $3894 for an additional drinking free
   day, $22,756 for an additional participant employed, and $1514 for an
   additional day worked. Conclusions: The ACWS intervention for adults
   with an alcohol use disorder and experiencing homelessness increased
   costs and improved alcohol use and employment outcomes compared with
   Usual Care. For policy- makers seeking a solution to alcohol use and
   unemployment with populations experiencing homelessness, ACWS may be a
   cost-effective solution.

AB Medical image segmentation is extensively applied in clinical diagnosis,
   providing physicians with accurate, rapid, and visual analysis tools.
   With the vigorous development of deep learning, the emergence of
   U-shaped networks has achieved outstanding performance in medical image
   segmentation. However, they cannot extract sufficient boundary features
   due to the continuous downsampling and focus primarily on local features
   without taking full advantage of global context information. In this
   paper, we present a Global Context-Enhanced Multi-Scale Residual Network
   (GCMR-Net) to tackle these problems. Specifically, the first component
   of GCMR-Net is a Multi-scale residual pooling (MSRP) module, which
   seamlessly integrates depth-wise separable convolution and atrous
   convolution to achieve more efficient feature extraction and information
   transmission. Second, based on the MSRP module, we propose a convolution
   encoder named MSRPE that progressively extracts abstract and
   higher-level features through cascaded convolutional layers. The
   features generated by MSRPE are efficiently reused in the corresponding
   decoder layers to facilitate the restoration of intricate image details.
   The third essential component is the global channel-spatial dual
   attention (GCSDA) mechanism, which enhances the global perception of the
   model and captures the contextual information to locate targets
   precisely. Furthermore, we design a feature pyramid compensation and
   refinement (FPCR) module, which mitigates feature loss in the decoder
   through various scales of convolution and upsampling operation,
   generating feature maps ranging from coarse to fine. Extensive
   comparative experiments are conducted on three biomedical image datasets
   and the results demonstrate that GCMR-Net exhibits competitive
   performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB Piezoelectric materials (PEMs) can convert mechanical energy into
   electrical energy. Substantial works were performed to optimize PEMs and
   devices for smart sensing, human monitoring, and medical applications,
   however, their electromechanical behaviors under such scenarios with
   different applied frequencies remain unclear. Here, the frequency
   response behaviors of piezoelectric output current are revealed based on
   lead-free and lead-based PEMs toward advanced applications. The results
   show a linear relationship between output current and frequency under
   short-circuit condition, with the slope varying according to loading
   force (F) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33). However, when a load
   resistance (RL) is applied, a nonlinear relationship is shown: the
   current increases with frequency, reaches a critical point, and
   subsequently levels off. The saturation current is influenced by F, RL,
   d33, and device capacitance (C), while the critical frequency is related
   to RL, C, and action distance. This fundamental behavior of PEMs aligns
   with Maxwell's displacement current deducing and is wellsupported by
   circuit simulations and physical modeling. The universality of these
   results is further confirmed through lead-based PEMs. Open-circuit
   voltage is unaffected by f, while load voltage exhibits the same
   nonlinear frequency response as load current. Applying these findings by
   combining machine learning, human posture monitoring and robot motion
   recognition were achieved. This work gives a deep understanding of
   intrinsic frequency response behaviors of electromechanical conversion
   in PEMs and guides the emerging piezoelectric sensing and monitoring
   applications.

AB Continuous and systematic research into calcium tetraborate (CTB) is
   essential due to its potential as a promising material for dosimetric
   applications. This study focuses on developing a novel phosphor by
   doping CTB with aluminum (Al) through a straightforward solid-state
   synthesis method. For the first time in the literature, we examine key
   dosimetric properties of this new material, including the glow curve
   structure, dose response, trapping parameters, and fading
   characteristics. The thermoluminescence (TL) properties of Al-doped
   CaB4O7 were examined using irradiation from a90Sr-90Y beta source. The
   TL kinetic parameters of CaB4O7 were analyzed using the computer glow
   curve deconvolution (CGCD) technique. The glow curve of 1 % Al-doped
   calcium tetraborate exhibited at least five distinct peaks, with the
   primary dosimetric peak observed at approximately 156 degrees C.
   Experimental findings demonstrate that Al-doped CTB possesses key
   attributes suitable for medical dosimetry, although it suffers from a
   significant fading issue, with a 58 % loss of signal over 7 days. This
   study concludes that while Al-doped CTB shows considerable promise for
   dosimetric applications, addressing the fading problem by incorporating
   additional co-dopantsis necessary.

AB Bears harbor various endoparasites that pose risks to humans and other
   animals. However, information on parasitic infections in Asiatic black
   bears in South Korea (Korea) is limited, and potential hazards still
   exist because of the close contact between bears and humans on bile
   farms. The present study was conducted to assess the gastrointestinal
   parasite infection status in captive Asiatic black bears (Ursus
   thibetanus) at bile farms in Korea. Additionally, we aimed to
   characterize the molecular aspects of Baylisascaris transfuga (Nematoda:
   Ascarididae), the sole species investigated throughout the study. Fecal
   examinations were performed on a total of 84 fecal samples collected
   from three bear farms in Hwacheon-gun (gun = County) and Donghae-si (si
   = City), Gangwon-do (do = Province), and Dangjin-si, Chungcheongnam-do.
   Eggs were identified morphologically, and an adult worm expelled in the
   feces was analyzed molecularly using the partial cytochrome c oxidase
   subunit 1 and 2 (cox1 and cox2) gene markers. The prevalence of
   helminthic eggs was 10.7 %, identified as B. transfuga based on
   morphological characteristics. The eggs, which were oval and brown with
   thick shells, had a mean length of 87.3 +/- 8.9 mu m on the long axis
   and 70.7 +/- 6.1 mu m on the short axis (n = 30). An adult female
   roundworm found in the feces of one individual, measuring 27 cm in
   length and 0.4 cm in width, was also identified as same species through
   genetic methods. Herein, we described the prevalence of B. transfuga in
   captive bears in Korea and its molecular characteristics for the first
   time. Additionally, we reviewed the sequences of the genus Baylisascaris
   available in the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collection,
   noting that many of these sequences often have ambiguous or potentially
   incorrect identifications, complicating the understanding of their
   phylogenetic status. This investigation is part of disease screening
   efforts aimed at enhancing the welfare of captive bears prior to their
   imminent relocation to sanctuaries. Health monitoring and endoparasite
   control in farmed bears should be carried out in both veterinary and
   public health contexts.

AB Photodynamic therapy (PDT) light sources must match their emission
   spectrum with the absorption spectrum of the photosensitizer, provide
   precise treatment definition, deliver adequate irradiance, avoid thermal
   damage, and minimize treatment duration. Additionally, they should be
   adaptable to different photosensitizers, easy to manipulate, and
   cost-effective. Current LED sources are difficult to customize, rigid,
   and primarily designed for broad-area treatments. For localized
   treatments, laser technology is commonly employed. We propose a
   customizable and programmable LED-based device that not only meets these
   specifications but also addresses the limitations of current LED sources
   for localized treatments. It allows for the connection of a fiber optic
   terminal for internal treatments and can be fitted with light-diffusing
   devices capable of treating lesions externally or penetrating them
   internally. This device is an enhanced version of a previously developed
   source that has demonstrated efficacy in several pilot studies of
   photodynamic therapy. The proposed equipment shows significant potential
   for both medical and research applications, enabling the configuration
   of emission spectra on demand and the establishment of tailored
   treatment protocols based on the type of lesion being treated.

AB Cor triatriatum is an uncommon cardiac defect that occurs in 0.1-0.4% of
   congenital heart disease patients. It is characterized by a
   fibromuscular membrane separating the left (sinister) or the right
   (Dexter) atriums in tow chambers. The disease is usually discovered
   accidently in late childhood, usually as a result of a moderate form of
   this condition type. We discuss the case of a 14-year-old girl who had
   been experiencing exertional dyspnea and palpitations for about a year.
   She was referred to our hospital for assessment after an initial
   echocardiogram at another hospital revealed a mass around the left
   atrium. Repeated echocardiography at our institution revealed dilated
   coronary sinus, confusing the diagnosis. The left atrium was dilated and
   divided into 2 chambers by a thin membrane with an elevated pressure
   gradient between the 2 chambers. Cardiac CT and MRI confirmed the
   diagnosis of cor triatriatum sinister (CTS) with concomitant persisting
   left superior vena cava. Because of her symptoms, she was started
   medical treatment and referred for surgical evaluation. Cor triatriatum
   sinister (CTS) is frequently accompanied with atrial septal
   abnormalities and enlarged coronary sinus caused by a persistent left
   superior vena cava, as demonstrated in our case. The management of cor
   triatriatum sinister (CTS) is determined by the severity of the
   symptoms. Asymptomatic individuals with no pressure gradient do not
   require therapy; however, significant membrane obstruction may require
   surgical removal, which typically leads to positive short- and long-term
   outcomes.

AB Fahr's disease is a rare neurological disorder which is characterized by
   the presence of abnormal, symmetrical, and bilateral calcifications
   within the basal ganglia and other cerebral areas. Seizures are 1 of the
   symptoms that may aid in its diagnosis. Fahr's disease is diagnosed in
   adults mostly. In this account, we describe the case of a male in his
   late 20s who was diagnosed with Fahr's disease. The patient experienced
   multiple seizures and severe headaches for the past 5 months. His
   medical history was not significant. Upon his admission to the emergency
   department, imaging studies (Computed Tomography and Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging) revealed the presence of bilateral and symmetrical
   calcifications situated within the bilateral corona radiata, bilateral
   centrum semiovale, bilateral gangliocapsular region, bilateral thalamus
   and bilateral dentate nucleus. Laboratory investigations ruled out
   alternative causes for secondary intracranial calcification. Moreover,
   the patient had no significant familial history. Considering the
   clinical, biological, and radiological evaluations, the diagnosis was
   concluded to align with a sporadic form of Fahr's disease. Although
   seizures are less common symptoms associated with Fahr's disease, the
   identification of bilateral and symmetrical calcifications in the basal
   ganglia and other regions on radiological imaging in a patient
   presenting with seizures should warrant consideration of this neurologic
   disorder, following the exclusion of other potential causes of
   intracranial calcification.

AB An anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the opposite sinus
   (R- ACAOS) with interarterial course is a very rare congenital anomaly
   with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. A 29-year-old woman was
   admitted for exertional angina pectoris. A coronary computed tomography
   angiography with 3D multiplanar reconstruction revealed an R-ACAOS
   running between the aorta and pulmonary artery with high anatomical
   features and no ischemia-induced at the stress test. The heart team
   staff decided to manage the patient surgically. Coronary arteries are
   characterized by their origin, course, and boundaries with intracardiac
   structures and large vessels. Computed tomography angiography is the
   gold standard exam to confirm the diagnosis and identify high-risk
   anatomic features that guide the management. It is important to consider
   treatment options for these patients whether by medical treatment,
   coronary angioplasty, or surgical repair, because of the increased risk
   of SCD. We hereby present an R-ACAOS with interarterial course and high
   anatomic features, which is an uncommon finding and can be fatal if it
   remains undiscovered.

AB Stroke ranks as the second leading cause of disability and mortality
   globally. Biomarker detection represents a promising avenue for
   predicting disease severity and prognosis. The expression levels of
   metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and
   N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP) in blood correlate
   with stroke severity. Hence, monitoring these biomarkers is crucial for
   stroke diagnosis and management. Point-of-care testing (POCT) offers
   on-site diagnostic capabilities, with lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA)
   being the most widely used method currently. However, traditional LFIA
   sensitivity requires enhancement. This study introduces an
   ultra-sensitive surface-enhanced Raman scattering-based lateral flow
   immunoassay (SERSbased LFIA) strip for simultaneous detection of the
   three stroke biomarkers using SERS immune tags. Bimetallic core-shell
   structured SERS immune tags leverage the advantages of two metals,
   ensuring stability and enhancing Raman signals through plasmon
   resonance. This development of a POCT based on SERS-based LFIA strips
   offers rapid, sensitive, and multiplex detection of stroke biomarkers.
   The limits of detection (LODs) for MMP-9, NSE, and NT-pro BNP were
   0.00020 ng mL- 1, 0.00016 ng mL-1, and 0.00012 ng mL- 1, respectively.
   Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) validated the
   accuracy of SERS-based LFIA. Clinical sample analysis demonstrated
   consistency between outcomes obtained by SERS-based LFIA and ELISA.
   Thus, SERS-based LFIA presents a novel POCT approach for stroke
   diagnosis.

AB Fungal rhinitis in horses is rare, although severe, due to the
   progressive nasal obstruction. Aspergillus is one of the fungi most
   often involved in these cases. A 7-year-old Quarter Horse mare weighing
   325 kg was admitted with a history of recurrent nasal discharge and
   bleeding, foul smell, reluctance to exercise, and abortion. Laboratory
   and imaging examinations revealed eosinophilia, scarring and erosion
   areas in the nasal mucosa, purulent and bloody secretions, and
   remarkable yellowish plaques. Histopathological examination revealed
   fungal rhinitis and bacterial culture revealed the presence of
   beta-hemolytic Streptococcus and Staphylococcus sp. Fungal culture and
   molecular diagnosis confirmed Aspergillus fumigatus as the etiological
   agent. A tracheostomy was necessary due to the patient's dyspnea. For
   the treatment, topical application of clotrimazole ointment was carried
   out in the rostral portion of the nasal cavity once a day and in the
   caudal portion of the nasal cavity, endoscopic guided every 48 h. In the
   fifth endoscopy-guided application, a significant improvement was
   noticed; however, the animal exhibited a hypersensitivity reaction, and
   the treatment was discontinued. Thus, potassium iodide therapy was
   initiated (67 mg/kg, PO, SID, 14 days). The patient demonstrated
   favorable clinical improvement, achieved resolution of the fungal
   infection, and was discharged after 25 days of hospitalization. Topical
   clotrimazole demonstrated a probable efficacy as a standalone treatment,
   although its use had to be prematurely discontinued due to the emergence
   of a hypersensitivity reaction. The combination of clotrimazole and
   potassium iodide effectively treated fungal rhinitis in a shorter time
   than previously reported. This report provides useful guidance for other
   cases of fungal rhinitis, although further studies are needed.

AB Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an extremely contagious and deadly
   virus that affects numerous bird species, posing serious threats to
   poultry production on a global scale. In addition to implementing
   biosecurity practices in farming systems, vaccination remains the most
   effective means of controlling Newcastle disease (ND). However, while
   existing commercial vaccines provide some level of protection, the
   effectiveness of these vaccines can be questionable, particularly in
   field settings where the complexity of vaccination program
   implementation poses significant challenges, especially against virulent
   genotypes of NDV. A genotype-matched NDV DNA vaccine could potentially
   offer a more effective vaccination approach than currently available
   live attenuated vaccines. By being specifically tailored to match
   circulating strains, such a vaccine might improve efficacy and reduce
   the risk of vaccine failure due to genotype mismatch. To develop an
   alternative vaccine approach, two ND DNA vaccines were constructed in
   this study. Each vaccine developed in this study contains the fusion (F)
   and haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes of a virulent NDV genotype
   VII isolate from Tanzania. Interferon lambda-3 (IFN lambda 3; IL-28b),
   which has demonstrated capacity to significantly enhance specific
   adaptive immune responses and decreased levels of inflammatory
   cytokines, as well as improved protective responses at a high viral
   challenge dose, was included in one of the developed vaccines. These
   plasmids were designated pTwist-F-HN-VII-IL28b and pTwist-F-HN-VII. The
   two plasmids differed in that pTwist-F-HN-VII-IL28b contained the
   cytokine adjuvant IL-28b. Transfection of cells and subsequent
   immunofluorescence assays indicated that both plasmids expressed high
   levels of NDV F-HN proteins. In vivo immunization demonstrated that
   chicks intramuscularly immunized with pTwist-F-HN-VII-IL28b exhibited
   significant immune responses compared to chicks immunized with
   pTwist-F-HN-VII or the commonly used LaSota vaccine (LaSota), which was
   used as a control. The protective efficacy of pTwist-F-HN-VII-IL28b was
   80% after challenge with the highly virulent NDV strain ON148423,
   compared to 60% for chicks vaccinated using LaSota, and pTwist-F-HN-VII.
   The findings of this study indicate that IL-28b can be employed as a
   molecular adjuvant for NDV vaccines. This study represents a key
   milestone in Newcastle disease vaccine research, particularly in the
   development of a genotype-matched DNA vaccine candidate. Additionally,
   this study demonstrated that the combination of F, HN, and IL-28b
   elicits an efficacious immune response against virulent NDV strains.

AB The present study investigates the prevalence and etiology of

   Romania. Milchtest and California Mastitis Test (CMT), were used for the
   detection of subclinical mastitis. A number of 360 milk samples across
   three lactation phases were analyzed. Subclinical mastitis was
   identified in 146 (40.6%) of sheep milk samples. Only milk samples (n =
   146) collected from sheep diagnosed with subclinical mastitis were
   considered for microbiological analyses. Thus, Staphylococcus aureus
   (129/146; 88.4%) was identified as the predominant pathogen followed by
   Streptococcus spp. (14/146; 9.6%) Enterococcus spp. (7/146; 4.8%),
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6/146; 4.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (5/146;
   3.4%). Antimicrobial susceptibility of isolated strains of
   Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. was also
   tested. The results showed varying resistance patterns depending on the
   farm and microorganism. In heard A the highest resistance of
   Staphylococcus aureus was identified to polymyxin B (79.7%) followed by
   novobiocin (73.4%) and tetracycline (45.3%); Streptococcus spp. to
   streptomycin (100%), novobiocin (100%), tetracycline (100%) and
   Enterococcus spp. to tylosin (100%), streptomycin (75.0%) and
   tetracycline (75.0%). In herd B, Staphylococcus aureus showed high
   resistance rates to polymyxin B (86.3%), novobiocin (74.5%) and
   cloxacillin (39.2%); Streptococcus spp. strains to streptomycin (100%),
   novobiocin (100%), tetracycline (100%) and Enterococcus spp. to
   gentamicin (100%), streptomycin (66.7%) and erythromycin (66.7%). The
   obtained preliminary results indicate a potential risk that future
   treatments of sheep mastitis may not be effective, and demonstrated that
   raw unpasteurized milk can harbor antimicrobial resistance pathogens
   posing a threat to public health. However, further investigations
   involving molecular research on resistance genes are required to draw
   comprehensive conclusions.

AB Canine parvovirus disease (CPVD) causes lymphopenia/immunosuppression,
   possibly through apoptosis of leukocytes possibly mediated by galectin-1
   and Mincle.Blood samples were taken from confirmed CPV-positive and
   non-CPV dogs and used for (para)clinicoheamatological
   evaluation.Optimized qPCR was performed to analyze mRNA levels of
   caspases 3/7 and 9, galectin-1 and Mincle in blood leukocytes.Results
   revealed remarkable lymphopenia and changes in mRNA levels of Mincle and
   galectin-1, but of caspases 3/7 and 9.The lymphopenia and
   immunosuppression observed in CPVD is not due to lymphocyte apoptosis,
   and changes in Mincle and galectin-1 functions partially limit
   parvovirus pathogenecity.
   Canine parvovirus disease (CPVD) is one of the most common causes of
   viral diarrhea in dogs. The disease has a mortality rate of up to 90% if
   left untreated, and can cause gastroenteritis, vomiting,
   mucoid/hemorrhagic diarrhea, lymphopenia and even immunosuppression.
   Based on the effects of canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) on the immune
   system, we investigated the effects of the CPV-2 on hematological
   indices and the expression of certain immune molecules in blood
   leukocytes of CPV-positive and non-CPV dogs. The dogs were
   (para)clinically evaluated, and their disease status was confirmed by
   antigen rapid detection kits and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To
   elucidate the nature of the immunosuppression seen in CPVD, we
   investigated the expression of caspases 3/7 and 9, and some lectin
   family molecules such as galectin-1 (important in viral adhesion) and
   Mincle (macrophage-inducible C-type lectin receptor), in blood
   leukocytes using reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). We
   observed remarkable lymphopenia, lower Hb concentration and higher red
   blood cell distribution width (RDW) value in CPV-positive dogs. No
   significant changes in expression of caspases 3/7 and 9 were detected,
   but galectin-1 and Mincle showed remarkable down and up-regulation,
   respectively. This proves that the immunosuppression seen in most CPVD
   is not caused by lymphocyte apoptosis in blood, and that Mincle is
   partially involved in the immune response to CPV-2. The observed changes
   in galectin-1 and Mincle may be a defense mechanism against parvovirus
   by potentially preventing the parvovirus from adhering to the cells.
   Further research is, nonetheless, needed to elucidate the possible roles
   of these molecules in CPV-2 pathogenesis and the immune system's
   response to parvovirus.

AB Equine piroplasmosis, a tick-borne disease caused by hemoparasites of
   the Babesia and Theileria genera, has significant clinical and economic
   impacts worldwide. This study aims to characterize the heat shock
   protein 70 kDa (hsp70) gene sequences of Theileria equi from naturally
   infected horses across the five geographic regions in Brazil, and to
   analyze the phylogenetic relationships between T. equi and other
   parasites within the order Piroplasmida. Primers specific to T. equi
   were designed through in silico analysis of hsp70 gene sequences
   available in GenBank. Forty samples of equine whole blood were subjected
   to DNA extraction and conventional PCR targeting the hsp70 gene. The
   resulting amplicons were purified and sequenced. The Hsp70 sequences
   generated were aligned using the ClustalW method, and phylogenetic
   analyses were conducted using Bayesian Inference (BI) and Maximum
   Likelihood (ML) methods. The evolutionary distance within and between
   species of parasites from the order Piroplasmida was evaluated, as was
   the entropy of the hsp70 gene sequence among Theileria species.
   Phylogenetic analysis of the forty sequences identified in this study
   revealed two circulating genotypes of T. equi in Brazil. One genotype
   comprised the American sequence along with thirty-six Brazilian
   sequences, while the other grouped a sequence from Mongolia with four
   Brazilian sequences. The Equus clade was distinctly placed with strong
   support, indicating a different evolutionary ancestor compared to
   Theileria spp. and Babesia spp. groups. The results confirmed hsp70 as
   an effective molecular marker for phylogeny, yielding topologies similar
   to those observed with 18 S rDNA while distinguishing closely related
   protozoan species such as T. haneyi and T. equi. This study provides
   valuable evolutionary insights into the phylogenetic relationships
   within the order Piroplasmida.

AB Degenerative changes in the skeletal system of dogs may occur as a
   consequence of aging, trauma, infection, or inflammation. The object of
   this study consisted of an 8-year-old male Labrador dog that was brought
   to a private veterinary clinic after a road traffic accident and died
   despite all interventions. For a different study planned in our
   department, CT images were taken of the Labrador retriever's humerus and
   osteophytes to encounter incidentally were investigated for found in
   these images. After the CT scan, the dissected humerus bones were boiled
   to remove soft tissues. Subsequently, the bones were underwent with a
   10% hydrogen peroxide solution for bleaching. Osteophytes in the
   proximal part of the humerus extended from the tuberculum majus and
   tuberculum minus towards the cranial direction, forming a complete
   ring-like structure at the level of the sulcus intertubercularis in the
   left humerus. Although not fully ring-shaped, similar osteophytes were
   found in the right humerus. In addition, it was observed that the
   foramen supratrochleare seen in the left humerus in the CT images was
   covered with a thin membrane during dissection. The presence of this
   membrane suggested that it might be due to the joint not being able to
   reach sufficient extension due to osteophytes forming in the bone.
   Additionally, it was concluded that CT may not recognize thin,
   non-mineralized septations, such as the membrane obliterating the
   supratrochlear foramen, as observed during necropsy.

AB The Western Ghat region of Kerala has abundant flora and domestic and
   wild animal species that provide an ideal ecological niche for the
   ticks. Kyasanur Forest Disease virus (KFDV), a zoonotic tick-borne virus
   causing Haemorrhagic fever, commonly known as monkey fever is prevalent
   in the area. The tick infestations have been documented in the majority
   of household animals in Wayanad and risks are further amplified as the
   majority of the animals reared, graze in the adjoining forest areas and
   these animals are often housed in and around farmer's dwellings.
   Therefore, the farmers are at high risk of contracting deadly tick-borne
   diseases, and surveillance in animals can act as an indicator of disease
   hotspots. Even though the tick-borne KFDV is endemic to the area, the
   surveillance data on other significant zoonotic tick-borne viruses such
   as CCHFV and GANV are scanty. Overall CCHFV seroprevalence of 2.33 was
   reported amongst livestock sampled. Species-wise percent seropositivity
   was 1.01 and 5.10 in cattle and goats, respectively. The study revealed
   the presence of ticks belonging to 3 genera viz. Rhipicephalus,
   Amblyomma, and Haemaphysalis. Despite the CCHFV seroprevalence, CCHFV
   and GANV could not be detected in ticks. Even though ticks were negative
   for the CCHFV genome, seroprevalence in adjoining taluks indicates the
   local virus circulation. Therefore serological as well as molecular
   investigation with a large number of samples collected at the peak of
   tick activity across the western ghat would help identify the potential
   hotspot for CCHFV.

AB The mastitis caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is
   increasing in the dairy cows. To investigate the epidemic of K.
   pneumoniae of China, 131 strains were isolated from 495 clinical
   mastitis milk samples (26.5%) from 14 provinces in China. Among the
   isolates, K57 was the dominant serotype (45.0%) and 19 (14.5%) isolates
   were identified as hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP). The mrkA, entB,
   wabG and fimH genes were prevalent virulence genes while rmpA, magA, and
   ycf were not found in K. pneumoniae. Furthermore, K. pneumoniae had
   serious antibiotic resistance and multiple beta-lactamase genes,
   including blaTEM, blaSHV, blaNDM, blaCTX-M, blaDHA, and blaKPC. Biofilm
   was an important factor in bacterial resistance and persistent
   infection, and 77.1% isolates could form biofilm. Although acylated
   homoserine lactone (AHL, a Gram-negative bacterial quorum sensing signal
   molecule) was not confirmed among the K. pneumoniae isolates, exogenous
   AHLs could reduce the biofilm formation ability of the K. pneumoniae
   strains. Three new ST types (ST6781, ST6782, and ST6783) were first
   identified in this study. The MLST phylogenetic tree showed the
   distribution of mastitis associated K. pneumoniae strains had no regular
   pattern, which confirmed high genomic diversity of mastitis associated
   K. pneumoniae. In conclusion, the high rate of isolation and serious
   antibiotic resistance of K. pneumonia were found in this study and
   indicated a potential threat to public health from the food chain.

AB A recently identified virus, chicken circovirus (ChCV), has been linked
   to the onset of acute gastroenteritis in chicks, a condition that can
   have a detrimental impact on the overall health and well-being of
   chickens in a farming setting. In this study, we developed an
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for the indirect
   detection of antibodies against the chicken circovirus (ChCV) through
   codon optimization, which effectively expressed the capsid protein of
   the ChCV and utilized it as an encapsulated antigen following
   purification. In establishing the ELISA method for detecting antibodies
   using the purified Cap protein as the antigen, the optimal concentration
   of the antigen was determined to be 1 mu g/mL, the optimal blocking
   solution was identified as 1% bovine serum albumin, the optimal dilution
   ratio of the serum to be tested was established to be 1:100, and the
   dilution ratio of the secondary antibody was determined to be 1:5,000.
   At these thresholds, the sensitivity of the ELISA method was 94.44%, and
   the specificity was 100%. The testing of 203 clinical samples yielded a
   positivity rate of 46.8%, indicating that the virus is endemic in
   chickens. In conclusion, this study established an ELISA method to
   detect antibodies against chicken circovirus using recombinant Cap
   protein as antigen, demonstrating good specificity and sensitivity. This
   lays the foundation for the development of related kits and the
   detection of infection and epidemiology of chicken circovirus.
   Meanwhile, the analysis concluded that chicken circovirus infection is
   more common, and the prevention and control of this disease should be
   emphasised and strengthened.
   The Cap protein of ChCV has been efficiently expressed by codon
   optimisation and purified.An ELISA method has been developed for the
   precise identification of antibodies associated with ChCV.Testing of
   clinical samples revealed high prevalence of ChCV infection.

AB The nasal mucosa is composed of multiple layers of barrier structures
   and is the first line of defense against infection by respiratory
   pathogenic microorganisms. A large number of commensal microorganisms
   are present in the nasal mucosa that mediate and regulate nasal mucosal
   barrier function. The objective of this research was to investigate the
   effects of commensal microorganisms on the nasal mucosal barrier. The
   results revealed that the strain of Bacillus velezensis (B. velezensis)
   NSV2 from the nasal cavity has good probiotic abilities to resist
   Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and
   Salmonella typhimurium. Lambs were subsequently administered
   intranasally with B. velezensis NSV2 at 3, 12, 21, and 26 days old,
   respectively. For the microbial barrier, although B. velezensis NSV2
   reduces the diversity of nasal microbiota, it significantly increased
   the relative abundance of beneficial bacteria in the nasal cavity, and
   reduced the abundance of potential pathogenic bacteria. For the mucus
   barrier, the number of goblet cells in the nasal mucosa significantly
   increased after B. velezensis NSV2 treatment. For the immune barrier, B.
   velezensis NSV2 also significantly increased the number of IgA(+) B
   cells, CD3(+) T cells and dendritic cells in the nasal mucosa, as well
   as the mRNA expression of interleukin (IL) 6, IL11, CCL2, and CCL20 (P <
   0.05). The protein level of CCL20 also significantly raised in nasal
   washings (P < 0.05). Moreover, the heat-inactivated and culture products
   of B. velezensis NSV2 also drastically induced the expression of CCL20
   in nasal mucosa explants (P < 0.05), but lower than that of the live
   bacteria. This study demonstrated that a symbiotic strain of B.
   velezensis NSV2 could improve the nasal mucosal barrier, and emphasized
   the important role of nasal symbiotic microbiota.

AB Hydrogels have been utilized in various medical applications, including
   drug delivery, tissue repair, biosensors, wound dressing, and
   antimicrobial activity. Electrically conducting hydrogels are
   particularly promising due to their unique features, such as high-water
   content, biocompatibility, and adjustable mechanical and electrical
   properties. In this study, we developed novel conductive
   polyaniline-based hydrogel systems with enhanced antibacterial and
   mechanical properties. We specifically investigated the contributions of
   polyacrylamide, chitosan, phytic acid, and polyaniline to the hydrogel's
   electrical sensitivity and stability under strain. Phytic acid and
   polyaniline were found to significantly improve the hydrogel's
   electrical sensitivity and mechanical stability. Phytic acid, in the
   presence of calcium ions, further enhanced the mechanical properties,
   while polyaniline increased the electrical conductivity of the hydrogel
   by approximately sevenfold and also improved its mechanical properties.
   The newly developed conductive hydrogel system shows great potential for
   biomedical applications, including wearable sensors.

   rolling strain, reinforcing layer thickness, and layer stacking on
   microstructure, grain refinement, hardness, shielding effectiveness, and
   in vitro corrosion and degradation properties of Ni/Mg/Ni and Mg/Ni/Mg
   multilayered composites. The composites were produced by seven passes of
   the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process at room temperature. The
   microstructural characterization showed the grain refinement in all
   layers. By increasing the thickness of reinforcing layers, the grain
   sizes of the inner layers decreased although the outer layers showed
   finer grains. The outer layers in composites also indicated higher
   hardness than the inner layers. The maximum hardness of the Mg layer in
   Mg/Ni/Mg and Ni/Mg/Ni was 85 and 77 HV while the maximum hardness of the
   Ni layer in Mg/Ni/Mg and Ni/Mg/Ni was 161 and 164 HV. In addition, the
   Ni/Mg/Ni composites with 57 dB showed better electromagnetic
   interference shielding effectiveness than Mg/Ni/Mg composites with 44
   dB. Furthermore, the mass attenuation coefficient of gamma rays of
   composites grew at higher rolling strains. The attenuation coefficients
   of composites were respectively 0.12 and 0.088 cm2/g for Ni/Mg/Ni and
   Mg/Ni/Mg composites after the final pass. Also, based on the results of
   in vitro corrosion and degradation, Ni/Mg/Ni and Mg/Ni/Mg composites
   revealed adverse behaviors versus rolling strain and thickness of the
   inner layer. The Ni/Mg/Ni composite showed maximum corrosion resistance
   and minimum degradation rate after the first pass with the thinnest Mg
   layer while the Mg/Ni/Mg composite showed maximum corrosion potential
   and minimum degradation rate after the final pass with the thickest Ni
   layer.

AB Soft robots capable of autonomous, continuous, fast, and adjustable
   motion speeds under constant external stimuli have great potential in
   environmental, industrial, military, and medical fields. Aiming at the
   difficulties of existing self-oscillators, including small oscillation
   range, difficulty of achieving non-reciprocal motion, and the slow
   forward speed of the resulting self-sustained soft robots. In this
   paper, a sunlight-driven self-oscillator based on MXene is prepared. By
   employing a bimorph structure and thermal regulation process, the
   selfoscillator exhibits two distinct oscillation modes: 'elastic' and
   'plastic' deformation. These modes can be modulated within the same film
   by varying the light power. A broader amplitude range (3.6-302.3
   degrees, 3.3 times that of the existing studies) is achieved by
   attaching a load to the film's end to enhance the inertial force of
   movement. Non-reciprocal motion in both modes and stable oscillations in
   sunlight are achieved. Finally, a lightdriven sailboat model is
   developed. The sailboat can achieve autonomous light-forward motion with
   a speed of up to 12.8 body length per minute (2.1 times that of existing
   studies), with its propulsion mechanism further explained through
   numerical simulation results. This research provides new strategies for
   constructing fast and large-amplitude self-oscillators and demonstrates
   the potential for applications in speed-adjustable autonomous forward
   devices.

   infrastructure contributes to residents' health. Mechanism tests confirm
   that increasing residents' income and enhancing medical services are
   underlying approaches. Digital infrastructure is conducive to the health
   of middle-aged people and rural residents. In areas with heavy air
   pollution and the eastern region, the impact of digital infrastructure
   on residents' health is more prominent. This study breaks through the
   existing qualitative research on digital technology in the healthcare
   sector, integrates both micro and macro perspectives, and enriches the
   empirical evidence in the field of digital health. It also contributes
   to guiding the in-depth practice of digital health in China, enhancing

   included 167 community-dwelling older people (aged >= 65) who were able
   to walk independently and used the SARC-F as a screening test for
   sarcopenia diagnosis. ECW/TBW and the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI)
   were measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis. The associations
   among the SARC-F score, ECW/TBW, and SMI were assessed using Spearman's
   correlation coefficient. Multiple linear regression analyses of the
   SARC-F score were conducted. Age, sex, number of medications, pain,
   medical history, ECW/TBW, and SMI were considered independent variables
   in multiple linear regression analysis. Results: The analyses revealed a
   significant positive correlation between the SARC-F score and ECW/TBW (r
   = 0.473, p < 0.001). SMI was significantly and negatively correlated
   with the SARC-F score (r = -0.233, p = 0.002). In the multiple linear
   regression analysis, ECW/TBW ((3 = 0.311, p < 0.001) and prevalence of
   pain ((3 = 0.169, p = 0.023) were significantly and independently
   associated with the SARC-F score (R2 = 0.260). SMI was not significantly
   associated with the SARC-F score ((3 = 0.002, p = 0.986). Conclusion:
   This study revealed a positive correlation between SARC-F score and
   ECW/TBW in community-dwelling older people, and this relationship
   persisted even after adjusting for confounding factors. However, there
   was no correlation between the SARC-F score and SMI. Our study indicated
   that the SARC-F score may be considered an indirect indicator of
   ECW/TBW. The score might also be useful for discriminating high and low
   ECW/TBW. These findings highlight a new use for SARC-F. (c) 2024

AB Heat-driven thermoacoustic refrigerators (HDTRs) offer great potential
   for the sustainable energy development due to their environmental
   friendliness, high reliability, and promising efficiency. However, there
   remains a gap in the comprehensive study and understanding of their
   acoustic matching and energy conversion mechanisms, the resolution of
   which would facilitate the development of more efficient HDTRs. This
   work employs Sage to model fundamental thermoacoustic engines and
   coolers, aiming to explore the effects of temperature and acoustic
   fields on their performance. It highlights the acoustic and
   temperature-matching patterns of looped HDTRs operating at room
   temperature range. The optimal impedance phase for the thermoacoustic
   engine and cooler is located on the negative and positive sides,
   respectively, of the pure traveling wave zero-phase point. The thermal
   buffer tube provides better phase matching between the engine outlet and
   cooler inlet compared to the resonator tube. Focusing on a single-unit
   HDTR system, the present study evaluates the steady-state performance
   and acoustic distribution analysis for systems different connections and
   couplings. Additionally, it compares looped HDTRs with various coupling
   configurations from the literature, further confirming the superior
   refrigeration performance of directly coupled systems. These findings
   provide valuable insights for developing more efficient thermoacoustic
   refrigerators, contributing to sustainable energy advancement.

AB BackgroundRisk difference is a valuable measure of association in
   epidemiology and healthcare which has the potential to be used in
   medical and clinical variable selection.ObjectiveIn this study, an
   attribute ranking algorithm, called AttributeRank, was developed to
   facilitate variable selection from clinical data sets.MethodsThe
   algorithm computes the risk difference between a predictor and the
   response variable to determine the level of importance of a predictor.
   The performance of the algorithm was compared with some existing
   variable selection algorithms using five clinical data sets on neonatal
   birthweight, bacterial survival after treatment, myocardial infarction,
   breast cancer, and diabetes.ResultsThe variable subsets selected by
   AttributeRank yielded the highest average classification accuracy across
   the data sets, compared to Fisher score, Pearson's correlation, variable
   importance function, and Chi-Square.ConclusionAttributeRank proved to be
   more valuable in attribute ranking of clinical data sets compared to the
   existing algorithms and should be implemented in a user-friendly
   application in future research.

AB Rationale, Aims and ObjectivesThe incorporation of economic
   considerations in clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) could help promote
   cost-conscious decision-making in healthcare. Though healthcare
   expenditures increase, and resources are becoming scarcer, the extent to
   which economic considerations are incorporated into CPGs remains
   limited. This scoping review aims to identify the challenges and
   potential stimulating factors to incorporate economic considerations in
   CPGs.MethodThis scoping review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs
   Institute Methodology and findings were reported according to the
   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
   extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. A systematic
   search was conducted in eight databases considering literature published
   from July 2017 and onwards. Data extraction was conducted via an
   iterative and inductive approach to identify challenges and potential
   stimulating factors from the included reports. Included documents
   focused on the (para)medical field and reported on CPG development and
   economic considerations.ResultsThe search identified 2445 documents from
   which 33 documents were included for analysis. The analysis identified
   five challenges: discourse surrounding economic considerations in CPGs,
   methodological ambiguities, scarcity of (high-quality) economic
   evidence, transferability of evidence, and resource constraints.
   Additionally, three potential stimulating factors were identified:
   acceptance, economic evidence knowledge, and guidance on incorporating
   economic considerations.ConclusionThese findings reflect the complexity
   of incorporating economic considerations in CPGs. The identified
   challenges highlight the need for clearer guidance (i.e. by training)
   and standardised methodologies for incorporating economic considerations
   in CPGs. The potential stimulating factors provide a roadmap for future
   efforts to enhance the integration of economic evidence in CPGs.
   Collaborative initiatives between health economists, CPG developers, and
   other stakeholders are essential to drive progress in this area and
   promote cost-conscious decision-making in healthcare.

AB Sevoflurane is extensively employed as an inhalation anesthetic in
   medical practices, due to its promising pharmacokinetics. Conversely,
   the data regarding effects of prolonged exposure to trace amounts of
   sevoflurane on the female reproductive system is obscure. Therefore,
   this study aimed to investigate the reproductive toxicity and underlying
   mechanism of long-term sevoflurane inhalation in female rats. A total 60
   SPF grade SD female rats were randomly alienated into four equal groups
   as control group (A), 50 ppm sevoflurane group (B), 150 ppm sevoflurane
   group (C), and 300 ppm sevoflurane groups (D). Ovaries and uterine
   organs were collected for gross as well as histopathological analysis,
   western blotting, and immuno-histochemistry evaluation. Results revealed
   that pregnancy rate, number of fetuses (fetal mice) and general body
   weight of group B, C, and D were substantially lower (P < 0.05), while
   were compared with control. On the contrary, estrous period in groups B,
   C, D was shortened noticeably (P < 0.05), and estrus interval and cycle
   were significantly longer (P < 0.05). In fact, the ovarian and uterine
   coefficients of group B, C and D were significantly reduced as compared
   with control. However, ovarian and uterine histomorphology remained
   normal in control group, while obvious pathological alterations were
   detected in groups B, C, and D. Although, the expression of SOD protein
   in the ovarian and uterine tissues of groups B, C, and D was
   significantly reduced (P < 0.05), in contrast to group A. However, the
   MDA protein expression increased significantly (P < 0.05) as compared
   with group A. While expression of apoptosis-related genes (Bcl2 and Bax)
   and humoral immunity related genes (IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha) showed
   highest elevation in groups exposure with sevoflurane (p < 0.001) in
   comparison to control. Conclusively, long-term inhalation of trace
   amounts of sevoflurane is toxic to female reproductive system and can
   severely affect reproductive organs and fertility by induction of
   oxidative stress and apoptosis.

AB Medical image segmentation is essential for accurately representing
   tissues and organs in scans, improving diagnosis, guiding treatment,
   enabling quantitative analysis, and advancing AI-assisted healthcare.
   Organs and lesion areas in medical images have complex geometries and
   spatial relationships. Due to variations in the size and location of
   lesion areas, automatic segmentation faces significant challenges. While
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have proven
   effective in segmentation task, they still possess inherent limitations.
   Because these models treat images as regular grids or sequences of
   patches, they struggle to learn the geometric features of an image,
   which are essential for capturing irregularities and subtle details. In
   this paper we propose a novel segmentation model, MSGH, which utilizes
   Graph Neural Network (GNN) to fully exploit geometric representation for
   guiding image segmentation. In MSGH, we combine multi- scale features
   from Pyramid Feature and Graph Feature branches to facilitate
   information exchange across different networks. We also leverage graph
   contrastive representation learning to extract features through self-
   supervised learning to mitigate the impact of category imbalance in
   medical images. Moreover, we optimize the decoder by integrating
   Transformer to enhance the model's capability in restoring the intricate
   image details feature. We conducted a comprehensive experimental study
   on ACDC, Synapse and BraTS datasets to validate the effectiveness and
   efficiency of MSGH. Our method achieved an improvement of 2.56-13.41%,
   1.04-5.11% and 1.77-3.35% of dice on the three segmentation tasks
   respectively. The results demonstrate that our model consistently
   performs well compared with state-of-the-art models. The source code is

AB One of the main challenges in the field of deep learning and embedded
   systems is the mismatch between the memory, computational and energy
   resources required by the former for good performance and the resource
   capabilities offered by the latter. It is therefore important to find a
   good trade-off between performance and computational resources used. In
   this study, we propose a novel ternarization heuristic based on the
   statistics of the weights, in addition to asymmetric pruning. Our
   approach involves the computation of two asymmetric thresholds based on
   the mean and standard deviation of the weights. This allows us to
   distinguish between positive and negative values prior to ternarization.
   Two hyperparameters are introduced into these thresholds, which permit
   the user to control the trade-off between compression and classification
   performance. Following thresholding, ternarization is carried out in
   accordance with the methodology of trained ternary quantization (TTQ).
   The efficacy of the method is evaluated on three datasets, two of which
   are medical: a cerebral emboli (HITS) dataset, an epileptic seizure
   recognition (ESR) dataset, and the MNIST dataset. Two types of deep
   learning models were tested: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
   1D CNN-transformers. The results demonstrate that our approach, aTTQ,
   achieves a superior trade-off between classification performance and
   compression rate compared with TTQ, for all the models and datasets. In
   fact, our method is capable of reducing the memory requirements of a 1D
   CNN-transformer model for the ESR dataset by over 21% compared to TTQ,
   while maintaining a Matthews correlation coefficient of 95%. The code is
   available at: https://github.com/yamilvindas/aTTQ.

AB Fog computing offers a viable solution to the overwhelming demands
   placed on cloud-based medical data processing, addressing issues related
   to low latency, storage, and bandwidth optimization for IoT
   applications. However, fog computing also presents challenges,
   particularly concerning privacy and security. Attribute-based encryption
   (ABE) has emerged as a robust cryptographic technique for ensuring the
   secure sharing of medical data. Despite its potential, existing systems
   face unresolved issues such as collusion induced by compromised users,
   trusted third-party attacks, bottleneck concerns in key generation, and
   inefficient key distribution. This study introduces both user and
   file-specific attributes-based encryption. It incorporates Chebyshev
   chaotic map to generate hash functions, enabling efficient session-based
   and mutual authenticated key setup in fog-based data-sharing scenarios.
   The proposed method offers a significant benefit through its
   authenticated session management, ensuring that confidential data is
   shared exclusively with authenticated users. Moreover, the approach
   effectively reduces third-party processing overheads and enhances
   protection against diverse cryptographic attacks like sybil attack,
   reply attack, guessing attack and modify attack. The proposed method
   effectively addresses crucial security aspects like authenticity,
   integrity and unpredictability. The comparison of computational and
   communication times with current systems underscores the significance of
   integrating ABE and the Chebyshev chaotic map for data sharing on
   devices with limited resources.

AB Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with pervasive
   stigma that contributes to several consequences, such as inaccessible
   and inadequate healthcare. Existing literature concerning the
   experiences of BPD stigma within healthcare settings predominantly
   centers on mental healthcare contexts. However, individuals with BPD
   also present with elevated physical disabilities and health concerns,
   demonstrating a need for regular contact with medical professionals to
   manage and coordinate physical healthcare. The current qualitative study
   analyzes the dynamics of stigma and consequences in medical settings for
   physical healthcare among individuals diagnosed with BPD. Community
   adults (N = 16, Mage = 29.50, 44% cisgender women) provided qualitative
   responses describing their experiences with stigma in medical settings
   other than for mental health purposes. The inductive thematic analysis
   generated six key themes: (1) Dismissal and Misattribution of Physical
   Symptoms, (2) Delayed or Inappropriate Medical Diagnosis and
   Intervention, (3) Communication and Advocacy Challenges, (4)
   Invalidation of Emotional Well-Being and Distress, (5) Self-Harm Stigma,
   and (6) Presumed Drug-Seeking Behavior. This article demonstrates the
   persistent and complex role of stigma across physical healthcare
   settings for individuals with BPD, affecting their physical and mental
   healthcare outcomes. It also identifies areas for future research and
   improvement and offers insights to ameliorate these issues.

AB Nowadays, biological and biochemical analysis using droplet-based
   microfluidics has become common practice. This process involves
   precisely locating the interface between miscible flows and dynamically
   controlling the sizes of oil-infused droplets in the segmented stream.
   Miniaturization for point-of-care diagnostics is hampered by the
   existing optical detection technology because it is costly,
   time-consuming, and requires a lot of processing to detect droplet
   contents. So, Optimized deep learning approach is developed to detect
   microfluidic droplets in bio medical research. To improve image quality,
   this proposed model pre-processes raw input images with Perona Malik
   Anisotropic Diffusion and range constrained bi-histogram equalization.
   Perona Malik Anisotropic Diffusion is used to denoise the input image,
   and range-limited bi-histogram equalization is used to increase the
   contrast level of the denoised image. The pre-processed image serves as
   an input for the droplet segmentation procedure. Image segmentation
   creates masks or contours for each recognized object in an image, as
   well as bounding boxes around those objects. To segment the
   pre-processed image, this current research uses the Optimized You Only
   Look Once (YOLO v7) technique. Anchor boxes are utilized in YOLO to
   produce candidate regions as well as anticipate bounding box adjustments
   and objectness ratings. Cheetah Optimization Algorithm (COA) is used for
   optimal selection of best anchor boxes in YOLOv7 rather than manually
   mapping the coordinates of anchor boxes. Proposed optimized deep
   learning model provides 96% accuracy, 93% precision, and 93.3% recall
   through a simulation study by comparing the actual and predicted
   droplets. Thus, the YOLO v7 with COA based segmentation improves the
   droplet prediction and servers as an efficient tool in bio medical
   research.

AB IntroductionThe potential applications of large language models (LLMs)-a
   form of generative artificial intelligence (AI)-in medicine and health
   care are being increasingly explored by medical practitioners and health
   care researchers.MethodsThis paper considers the ethical implications of
   LLMs for medical practitioners in their delivery of clinical care
   through the ethical framework of principlism.FindingsIt finds that,
   regarding beneficence, LLMs can improve patient outcomes through
   supporting administrative tasks that surround patient care, and by
   directly informing clinical care. Simultaneously, LLMs can cause patient
   harm through various mechanisms, meaning non-maleficence would prevent
   their deployment in the absence of sufficient risk mitigation. Regarding
   autonomy, medical practitioners must inform patients if their medical
   care will be influenced by LLMs for their consent to be informed, and
   alternative care uninfluenced by LLMs must be available for patients who
   withhold such consent. Finally, regarding justice, LLMs could promote
   the standardisation of care within individual medical practitioners by
   mitigating any biases harboured by those practitioners and by protecting
   against human factors, while also up-skilling existing medical
   practitioners in low-resource settings to reduce global health
   disparities.DiscussionAccordingly, this paper finds a strong case for
   the incorporation of LLMs into clinical practice and, if their risk of
   patient harm is sufficiently mitigated, this incorporation might be
   ethically required, at least according to principlism.

   validated Read codelists, selecting and classifying them in three steps.
   The qualitative step included an in-depth revision of the codes by six
   doctors. Simultaneously, the quantitative step performed on UK primary
   care data included an exploratory factor analysis to cluster Read codes
   in MH conditions to obtain an independent classification. The
   statistical results informed the qualitative conclusions, generating a

   2007 Read codes, a total of 1638 were selected by all doctors. Later,
   they agreed on classifying these codes into 12 categories of MH
   disorders. From the same preselected list, a total of 1364 were
   quantitatively selected. Using data from 497,649 persons who used these
   Read codes at least once, we performed the exploratory factor analysis,
   retaining five factors (five categories). Both classifications showed
   good correspondence, while discrepancies informed decisions on
   reclassification.ConclusionsWe produced a comprehensive set of medical
   codes lists for 12 MH conditions validated by a combination of clinical
   consensus panel and quantitative cluster analysis with cross-validation.

AB RationaleThe Patient-Centred Medical Home (PCMH) is a model of
   team-based care that is patient centred, coordinated, accessible, and
   focused on quality and safety. To learn how this model of healthcare
   works in an Indigenous primary health care setting in Australia, we
   explored the experiences of health staff in an urban Aboriginal
   Community Controlled Health Service (ACCHS) transitioning to an adapted
   model of a PCMH. Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) was applied to
   better understand factors enabling and inhibiting implementation of the
   PCMH, and the work required to deliver it.Aims and ObjectivesApplying
   NPT, we aimed to examine enablers and barriers to implementing a PCMH in
   an ACCHS setting and identify practical strategies to strengthen its
   implementation and delivery.MethodsWe employed semi-structured
   interviews with 19 health staff in an urban ACCHS to explore mechanisms
   that inhibit and promote the implementation and delivery of a PCMH in
   their setting. Interview data were analysed using thematic analysis that
   mapped codes against NPT constructs (Coherence, Cognitive Participation,
   Collective Action and Reflexive Appraisal) to generate
   themes.ResultsFive key themes and 14 sub-themes related to NPT
   constructs were identified. Broadly, health staff found the model of the
   PCMH to be coherent, engaged with others to adapt their roles, and
   worked collectively to embed new practices. Characteristics and practice
   norms of the clinic already aligned with the PCMH model were key
   enablers. Barriers were related to inadequate resourcing and ill-defined
   roles. Stronger leadership and support, practical learning resources for
   staff, workforce mapping to better define staff roles, and training to
   address gaps in staff skills were strategies identified for
   strengthening implementation of a PCMH and sustaining its delivery in
   the ACCHS setting.ConclusionsApplying NPT revealed the characteristics
   and practice norms of Indigenous community controlled health care as key
   enablers of implementing a PCMH in an urban ACCHS. Less than optimal
   resourcing and workforce development emerged as barriers needing to be
   resolved to strengthen implementation and delivery of a PCMH in this
   setting.

AB RationaleLimited health literacy (HL) leads to poor health outcomes,
   psychological stress, and misutilization of medical resources. Although
   interventions aimed at improving HL may be effective, identifying
   patients at risk of limited HL in the clinical workflow is challenging.
   With machine learning (ML) algorithms based on readily available data,
   healthcare professionals would be enabled to incorporate HL screening
   without the need for administering in-person HL screening tools.Aims and
   ObjectivesDevelop ML algorithms to identify patients at risk for limited
   HL in spine patients.MethodsBetween December 2021 and February 2023,
   consecutive English-speaking patients over the age of 18 and new to an
   urban academic outpatient spine clinic were approached for participation
   in a cross-sectional survey study. HL was assessed using the Newest
   Vital Sign and the scores were divided into limited (0-3) and adequate
   (4-6) HL. Additional patient characteristics were extracted through a
   sociodemographic survey and electronic health records. Subsequently,
   feature selection was performed by random forest algorithms with
   recursive feature selection and five ML models (stochastic gradient
   boosting, random forest, Bayes point machine, elastic-net penalized
   logistic regression, support vector machine) were developed to predict
   limited HL.ResultsSeven hundred and fifty-three patients were included
   for model development, of whom 259 (34.4%) had limited HL. Variables
   identified for predicting limited HL were age, Area Deprivation
   Index-national, Social Vulnerability Index, insurance category, Body
   Mass Index, race, college education, and employment status. The
   Elastic-Net Penalized Logistic Regression algorithm achieved the best
   performance with a c-statistic of 0.766, calibration slope/intercept of
   1.044/-0.037, and Brier score of 0.179.ConclusionElastic-Net Penalized
   Logistic Regression had the best performance when compared with other ML
   algorithms with a c-statistic of 0.766, calibration slope/intercept of
   1.044/-0.037, and a Brier score of 0.179. Over one-third of patients
   presenting to an outpatient spine center were found to have limited HL.
   While this algorithm is far from being used in clinical practice, ML
   algorithms offer a potential opportunity for identifying patients at
   risk for limited HL without administering in-person HL assessments. This
   could possibly enable screening and early intervention to mitigate the
   potential negative consequences of limited HL without taxing the
   existing clinical workflow.

AB RationaleThe Drug Burden Index (DBI) measures exposure to
   anticholinergic and sedative drugs, which are associated with harm in
   older adults. To facilitate deprescribing in older Australian
   inpatients, we piloted an intervention bundle integrating the DBI in
   Electronic Medical Records, clinician deprescribing guides, consumer
   information leaflets and a stewardship pharmacist.ObjectivesTo
   understand (i) hospital clinician experiences of using the bundle and
   (ii) consumer (patient and carer) and General Practitioner (GP)
   experiences of in-hospital deprescribing, following bundle
   implementation.MethodsHospital clinicians from target services (General
   and Geriatric Medicine) at an Australian metropolitan tertiary-referral
   hospital, were invited to complete surveys, including the System
   Usability Scale (SUS), and interviews. Patients aged >= 75 years with
   high DBI (DBI >= 1) were admitted to target services, and their carers,
   received interview invitations. Consenting patients' GPs received
   surveys. Qualitative data was thematically analysed. Hospital clinician
   interviews were mapped to the Human Organisation Technology-fit
   Framework. Patient interviews were mapped to an adaptation of the
   National Health Service Patient Experience Framework.ResultsSeventeen
   hospital clinicians (n = 15 medical, n = 2 pharmacists) and four GPs
   completed surveys. Eight hospital clinicians (n = 7 medical, n = 1
   pharmacist), seven patients and two carers completed interviews.
   Hospital clinicians reported good usability (SUS score 71.5 +/- 12.5).
   Most themes were around system use and user satisfaction. They reported
   the intervention was useful for medication review, identified challenges
   from pre-existing heavy workload and suggested further integration into
   workflows. Patients and carers reported themes around information,
   communication and education. Patients reported feeling better or no
   different post-deprescribing. Patients, carers and GPs described poor
   communication regarding in-hospital medication changes and their
   rationale.ConclusionsThe intervention was well accepted by hospital
   clinicians. The bundle requires further integration into workflows for
   sustainability and assessment of generalisability in other health
   services. Given patients, carers and GPs reported poor
   medication-related communication, future interventions may target this.

AB RationaleFew have assessed the impact of group visits (GVs), or shared
   medical appointments, on community health centre (CHC) staff and
   provider burnout, wellness, and job satisfaction.Aims and ObjectivesThis
   study assesses the impact of diabetes GV implementation on staff and
   provider morale and burnout.MethodsIt is a pre-post study from a larger
   cluster randomised trial. Two cohorts of providers and staff from 13
   Midwestern CHC clinics implemented in-person (N = 39) and virtual (N =
   31) GVs for adults with diabetes. Semi-structured interviews
   (post-implementation) and surveys (pre and post-implementation) were
   conducted with staff and providers in both cohorts to assess changes in
   burnout, staff morale, and job satisfaction, along with reported
   benefits and burdens of GVs. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts
   and significance testing for survey data was then
   performed.ResultsInterview data came from the in-person cohort (N = 15)
   and the virtual cohort (N = 19). Survey data were collected from a total
   of 70 respondents from the in-person (N = 39) and virtual (N = 31)
   cohorts. Key results include reported improved relationships with
   colleagues ('it has made our professional relationships stronger and I
   feel more comfortable talking about other things, as well'.),
   strengthened connections with patients ('We were able to help patients
   on a deeper level and provide more detail and one-on-one care'.), and
   individual reward ('Morale has increased. They're contributing and doing
   something positive for the patients'.). When asked about in-person
   versus virtual GVs, respondents noted they preferred in-person care but
   appreciated the flexibility virtual care afforded. Survey results
   revealed improved job satisfaction in the 2018 cohort and improved
   morale in the 2020 cohort, as well as perceived benefits including
   increased interprofessional collaboration and increased connection to
   patients.ConclusionsImplementation of GVs in the CHC setting impacted
   key areas of burnout, including relationships, job attachment, and
   feelings of meaningful contribution in the workplace among providers and
   staff. Future clinic-based implementation studies may consider measuring
   staff and provider well-being as part of the evaluation.

AB INTRODUCTION: Understanding students' learning approach, modifying
   teaching methods, curriculum and material accordingly is essential to
   deliver quality education. Knowing more about the learning approaches
   assists in upgrading the profession's quality for continuous
   professional development.
   METHODS: The cross-sectional study was carried out among physiotherapy
   students studying in physiotherapy colleges affiliated with the same
   university. The Approaches and Study Skills Inventory for Students
   questionnaire was used to evaluate learning approaches in both
   preclinical and clinical students. Data were analysed using the IBM
   Statistical Package SPSS 27. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05.
   RESULTS: A total of 250 participants with a mean age of 21.09+1.93
   years, 129 (51.6%) in the preclinical group and 121 (48.4%) in the
   clinical group participated in the study. 67 (26.7%) of the students
   were male, while 183 (72.9%) were females. The vast majority of
   participants (97.6%) adopt a deep approach to learning, while only a
   small fraction (2.0%) use a surface approach, with the strategic
   approach being rarely used (0.4%). No significant difference was
   observed between the males and females, and students of different
   colleges under the same university.
   CONCLUSION: The predominant approach is the deep learning approach
   reflecting active learning. This may indicate that curriculum and
   strategies of teaching are employed over physiotherapy students to
   promote quality learning. Also, the teaching preferences varies between
   two group of physiotherapy students. Thus, this will also assist
   physiotherapy educators in planning and delivering learning activities
   according to learners by knowing their preferences.

AB Purpose of ReviewBurnout is a context-dependent, global issue among
   physicians in the medical field who often face job-related stressors,
   high workloads, and limited or lack of social support or autonomy.
   Within medicine, neurology is a specialty with high levels of burnout
   and low levels of work-life satisfaction. We, therefore, conducted this
   study to evaluate burnout rates among neurologists globally and identify
   the tools used to evaluate it. Recent FindingsAmong the 14 articles
   analyzed, the mean burnout prevalence rate among neurologists ranged
   from 18.1% to 94% (N = 8,735) across 6 countries (the United States,
   China, Philippines, Spain, Greece, and Brazil). Assessment of burnout
   using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) revealed that almost
   two-thirds (65.9%) of neurologists (N = 7,816) report experiencing
   burnout. Ten studies (71.4%) assessed burnout by using the MBI; the
   other 4 studies used the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory, a survey
   questionnaire generated by the American Academy of Neurology Stroke
   Practice Resources Workgroup, the Mini-Z survey, and a single question
   from the Physician Work Life Study. Among the 5 studies that used the
   same tool for measuring burnout (22-item MBI) and burnout criteria
   cutoff (emotional exhaustion [EE] >= 27 and/or depersonalization (DP) >=
   10 subscale), the mean burnout rate ranged from 45% to 67% (p < 0.05, N
   = 7,816) across 3 countries (China, the United States, and Brazil). Of
   the studies that used the MBI and reported the 3 subscales of EE, DP,
   and personal accomplishment (PA), only the mean EE score was
   statistically different between studies. There were no significant
   differences detected in burnout rates among residents, among attending
   physicians, or residents compared with attendings. SummaryThis
   meta-analysis of burnout among practicing neurologists reveals that
   available published data span different levels of training, different
   sample sizes, and different survey tools with different cutoffs used for
   burnout within the same tool. Although burnout rates among neurologists
   were found to differ by country, it is evident from this systematic
   review that a great deal of neurology physicians are experiencing
   burnout across the globe. This systematic review may inform future
   approaches to reduce burnout among neurologists.

AB Introduction: Screening colonoscopy is often performed on patients who
   are younger or older than the ages specified in national guidelines or
   at shorter intervals than recommended. The annual incidence of harms
   associated with overuse of screening colonoscopy in the U.S. is not
   known. This study estimated the incidence of low-value screening
   colonoscopies annually in the U.S. and the number of preventable harms
   associated with them.
   Methods: The 2018 National Health Interview Survey was used to estimate
   the number of annual screening colonoscopies. Rates of colonoscopy
   overuse and serious (bleeding and bowel perforation) and minor harms
   were drawn from 3 recent systematic reviews.
   Results: Approximately 12.4 million screening colonoscopies were
   completed in the U.S. in 2018. Given the credible range of overuse rates
   of screening colonoscopy, between 2.1 and 3.2 million low-value
   colonoscopies occur per year. Applying the credible ranges identified
   for serious and minor harms secondary to screening colonoscopy resulted
   in an estimated annual incidence of serious harm from unnecessary
   colonoscopies ranging from 9,055 to 11,874. The estimate for minor harms
   ranged from 359,5790 to 1,566,846.
   Conclusions: In the U.S., screening colonoscopies are often completed at
   intervals and in populations that are inconsistent with national
   recommendations, resulting in unnecessary serious and minor harm.
   Although individual risk is relatively low, the large number of
   nonindicated screening colonoscopies results in large numbers of adverse
   events that are preventable with better adherence to recommendations.

AB Introduction. - Since their creation 30 years ago, post-occupational
   (POM) and post-exposition (PEM) monitoring has remained under-utilized
   by potential beneficiaries, and their recent reform has not improved the
   situation. As secondary prevention programs, they aim to detect the
   onset of disease as early as possible in retirees who have been exposed
   to carcinogens. One of the reasons for non-use is the anxiety felt by
   beneficiaries when faced with medical examinations. The aim is to show
   how occupational physicians take into account the anxiety their patients
   experience during consultations, so as to achieve their prevention
   objectives. Materials and methods. - The data used come from the
   interventional research on post occupational cancer monitoring in Finist
   & egrave;re (Rispop29), financed by the French National Cancer Institute
   (Inca) and running since 2020. The analysis is based on the observation
   of medical consultations carried out at the Regional Center for
   Occupational and Environmental Pathologies of the CHRU in Brest.
   Results. - POM and PEM consultations occur at the patient's request,
   have no bearing on career orientation, and concern occupational exposure
   that is no longer relevant. Patients have very high expectations of the
   results of their examinations. Anxiety weighs heavily on the
   consultation process. Two case studies illustrate the denial and
   distress expressed in this context. the first case, the physician seeks
   to reveal the anxiety that the patient is protecting himself from, while
   in the second, he seeks to reduce this anxiety by offering psychological
   support. Discussion. - The challenge is to maintain the patient's
   commitment by finding a balance between highlighting the risk of
   pathology and the need for reassurance, so that the patient sufficiently
   aware of the risk but is not paralyzed by it. Conclusion. - The
   physician has resources at his disposal that he can mobilize to regulate
   the patient's anxiety. The introduction of psychological support for
   beneficiaries would certainly increase the take-up rate.

AB Background and aims: The interaction between full-spectrum chronic
   kidney disease (CKD) and atrial fibrillation (AF) on ischemic stroke and
   all-cause mortality risk, particularly in stage 4 and 5 CKD, remains
   undetermined. Methods: This matched cohort study identified incident AF
   patients using the International Classification of Disease codes and
   electrocardiograms from the Clinical Research Data Repository of China
   Medical University Hospital between 2003 and 2020. For each AF patient,
   we selected four controls without AF and matched them by age, sex, eGFR
   within 10 mL/min/1.73 m(2), end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) vintage, and
   diagnosis year. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were
   utilized to assess the interaction between AF and CKD on three-year
   ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality outcomes. Results: Within a
   total of 10,155 patients and 39,439 controls, incidence rates were 3.03
   % and 1.48 % for ischemic stroke and 15.6 % and 9.53 % for overall
   mortality, respectively. In AF, the stroke risk was the highest among
   patients with stage 4 and 5-ND (non-dialysis) CKD with adjusted hazard
   ratio (aHR) of 3.31 (95 % CI, 2.46-4.45) and 2.73 (1.88-3.96),
   respectively. The mortality risk difference varied between 45% and 177 %
   with the highest difference noted in ESKD (aHR 3.36 [95 % CI, 2.84-3.98]
   in AF vs. 1.59 [95 % CI, 1.28-1.96] in non-AF; interaction p < 0.001).
   Anticoagulation therapy significantly lowered the mortality risk among
   patients with AF and advanced CKD (3-way interaction p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: The risk of ischemic stroke and overall mortality was
   particularly high among patients with concurrent AF and stage 4 and 5-ND
   CKD, underscoring the urgent evidence to optimize prognosis.

AB When planning an oncology clinical trial, the usual approach is to
   assume proportional hazards and even an exponential distribution for
   time-to-event endpoints. Often, besides the gold-standard endpoint
   overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) is considered as
   a second confirmatory endpoint. We use a survival multistate model to
   jointly model these two endpoints and find that neither exponential
   distribution nor proportional hazards will typically hold for both
   endpoints simultaneously. The multistate model provides a stochastic
   process approach to model the dependency of such endpoints neither
   requiring latent failure times nor explicit dependency modeling such as
   copulae. We use the multistate model framework to simulate clinical
   trials with endpoints OS and PFS and show how design planning questions
   can be answered using this approach. In particular, nonproportional
   hazards for at least one of the endpoints are a consequence of OS and
   PFS being dependent and are naturally modeled to improve planning. We
   then illustrate how clinical trial design can be based on simulations
   from a multistate model. Key applications are coprimary endpoints and

AB Introduction: Increasing overdose deaths and criminal legal involvement
   among women necessitate women- specific solutions to curb the adverse
   consequences of substance use disorders (SUDs). The current study is the
   pre-implementation phase of an implementation science study that works
   with various stakeholders-affected women, criminal legal professionals,
   and SUD treatment professionals-to identify and address high-priority
   needs for criminal-legal involved women with SUDs. Methods: This study
   uses semi-structured interviews (N = 42) administered in 2022 to women
   with a history of SUD and criminal legal involvement (n = 20), SUD
   treatment professionals (n = 12), and criminal legal professionals (n =
   10). Interviews focused on participants' history of substance use and
   criminal legal involvement, facilitators and barriers to initiating and
   completing treatment, and gender-specific issues encountered during
   treatment and criminal legal involvement. Drawing on the social
   ecological model of health, analyses identified gender-specific
   challenges impacting criminal-legal involved women's treatment and
   recovery processes. Results: Participants identified five
   gender-specific challenges impacting women across social ecological
   levels. At the relational level, challenges stemmed from women's roles
   as mothers and from victimization within healthcare and criminal legal
   settings; at the community level, from unequal resource allocation for
   treatment; and at the societal level, from stigma associated with
   certain intersectional identities and cultural norms that constrict job
   opportunities. Participants noted that providing women with effective
   care coordination and women-specific guidelines and spaces within the
   criminal-legal system could mitigate some of these challenges.
   Discussion: Findings highlight the need to consider gender-specific
   challenges faced across relational, community, and societal levels when
   implementing medical interventions and criminal legal proceedings for
   women. Given these findings and extant literature, the authors are
   developing an all-female, trauma-informed intervention that includes
   case management with female certified recovery specialists who are in
   recovery and have navigated the criminal legal system. By reducing some
   of the gender-specific barriers identified in this study, this future
   intervention aims to improve the substance use and criminal legal
   outcomes of participating women.

AB Medicine repurposing is a strategy to identify new uses for the existing
   medicines for the purpose of addressing areas of unmet medical need.
   This paper aims to provide horizon scanning intelligence on repurposed
   medicines that are evaluated by non-commercial organizations such as
   academia and highlights opportunities for further research to improve
   patient health outcomes. A scan of the clinical landscape of
   non-commercially sponsored repurposed medicines is routinely conducted
   by the NIHR Innovation Observatory (IO). This ongoing project involves a
   horizon scan of clinical trial registries and the IO's internal horizon
   scanning Medicines Innovation Database to identify potential candidate
   medicines used as monotherapy or in combination to treat new indications
   outside the scope of their licensed indication. In addition to making
   these data publicly available, the output also supports the NHS England
   Medicines Repurposing Programme. The snapshot scan reported here (trials
   completing April 2020-March 2023) identified a total of 528 technologies
   (meaning, a single product or combination of medicinal products
   targeting a specific indication in one or more related trials). The
   technologies were classified according to their characteristics and
   targeted therapeutic indications as well as revealing the least treated
   disease conditions. The candidate medicines identified in this scan
   could potentially receive tailored support toward adoption into practice
   and policy. The NIHR IO regularly provides this scan as a source of
   intelligence on repurposed medicines. This provides valuable insights
   into innovation trends, gaps, and areas of unmet clinical need.

AB Bickerstaff Brainstem Encephalitis (BBE) is a rare immunologic condition
   characterized by CNS inflammation, presenting with ataxia, external
   ophthalmoplegia, altered consciousness, and quadriplegia. A 25-year-old
   male with no significant medical history exhibited symptoms of blurred
   vision, diplopia, facial numbness, and imbalance following a respiratory
   infection. Brain MRI revealed hyperintense lesions in the cerebral
   peduncle and pons on T2-weighted/FLAIR sequences but not on T1-weighted
   sequences, indicative of demyelination. Lumbar puncture showed clear
   cerebrospinal fluid with lymphocytic pleocytosis (80 cells/mul, 95%
   lymphocytes) and normal protein levels. The patient was treated with
   intravenous methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day for five days), resulting in
   recovery and normal follow-up MRI findings. Early diagnosis and
   treatment are crucial to minimize complications and improve outcomes.
   Additionally, airway management is essential for patients with impaired
   respiratory function, and long-term rehabilitation may be necessary for
   those recovering from encephalitis.

AB Feature selection is crucial in data preprocessing, especially in
   medical data analysis. Although the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO)
   algorithm has attracted attention because of its simplicity and
   efficiency, it is prone to falling into the local optimum when searching
   fora globally optimal solution when dealing with complex feature
   selection problems, which restricts its application potential. To solve
   this problem, this paper proposes the Elite-driven Grey Wolf Optimizer
   (EDGWO) algorithm. The EDGWO algorithm significantly improves the global
   search capability of Alpha, Beta, and Delta grey wolves by taking
   advantage of the social hierarchy of the grey wolf population and
   designing three global exploration operators. The algorithm smoothly
   transitions from extensive exploration to intensive exploitation by
   dynamically adjusting the search parameters A. In addition, the
   introduced stochastic probabilistic search strategy allows omega grey
   wolves to make a flexible choice between local exploitation and global
   exploration, effectively avoiding premature convergence during the
   search process. To evaluate the performance of the EDGWO algorithm, this
   study compared twenty-two standard benchmark functions of CEC2021 and
   CEC2022 and twelve cancer microarray datasets. The experimental results
   show that the EDGWO algorithm demonstrates superior exploration and
   exploitation capabilities compared to fifteen well-known algorithms,
   with fast convergence speed and effective circumvention of local optima.
   Various evaluations have shown that EDGWO achieved the best Friedman
   rankings in the 10- and 20-dimensional CEC2021 and CEC2022 benchmark
   functions. In particular, the EDGWO algorithm maintains high convergence
   speed and high accuracy in feature selection for cancer microarray
   datasets.

AB Introduction: Consequences of alcohol use disorder (AUD) are associated
   with mental and somatic burdens that result in alcohol withdrawal
   syndrome (AWS), with 30% of AWS cases leading to life- threatening
   delirium tremens (DTs). So far, biomarkers for tracking abstinence
   syndrome that are useful in clinical practice have yet to be detected.
   Current research focuses on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
   effects on neurogenesis, modulation of plasticity, and its role in the
   pathogenesis of AWS and DTs. Aims: The present study aimed to assess
   pro-BDNF and BDNF concentrations in a group of patients with AWS.
   Changes in BDNF and prof-BDNF were also evaluated with attention to
   subgroups of patients with coexisting mental and somatic disorders, with
   a particular emphasis on the presence or absence of DTs. Results: The
   AWS group had a higher concentration of BDNF and a lower concentration
   of pro-BDNF compared to the control group, and BDNF increased during 7
   days of hospitalisation. Patients with co- morbid psychiatric disorders
   had higher levels of pro-BDNF than those without disease and also had
   higher levels of BDNF at the end of the study than at the beginning. On
   the other hand, patients with coexisting somatic diseases had higher
   levels of pro-BDNF at the beginning than at the end of the study, while
   patients with delirium had higher BDNF levels at the end of the study
   than at the beginning. Conclusions: The obtained results indicate that
   pro-BDNF and BDNF may be useful markers for the course of withdrawal
   syndrome. In particular, BDNF showed an association with the development
   of delirium complications. The authors are aware of several limitations
   of the work only men in the SG, different age between SG and CG. (c)

AB Introduction: The impact of overweight and obesity on pathological
   outcomes, complications, and oncologic outcomes following surgery for
   gastric adenocarcinoma has been poorly reported in Western populations.
   This study aimed to better understand the impact of overweight and
   obesity on both surgical and oncological outcomes in patients who
   underwent surgery for gastric cancer. Methods: Data were retrospectively
   collected from a multi-institutional European database. 1589 patients
   underwent surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma between 2007 and 2017.
   Patients were divided into three groups according to their body mass
   index (BMI): 722 normoponderal patients (45.4 %), 585 overweight
   patients (36.8 %), and 282 obese patients (17.7 %). Results: The tumor
   stage, administration of perioperative chemotherapy, number of harvested
   lymph nodes, and reoperation rates were similar. Tumor location differed
   between the groups, with more distal locations in normoponderal patients
   than in overweight patients (51.4 % vs. 44.1 %, p = 0.04). Surgical
   complications were more frequent in obese patients than in normoponderal
   patients (34.8 % vs. 24.2 %, p = 0.005), and severe postoperative
   complications too. The medical complication rate was higher in
   overweight and obese patients (31.5 % and 32.6 % vs. 24.1 %, p = 0.003).
   There was no difference in the overall survival. Conclusions: Obesity
   was not related to tumor stage, pre- or intraoperative strategies, or
   survival in patients undergoing surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma.
   However, postoperative morbidity increases in patients with obesity.
   Surgery for gastric adenocarcinoma should be proposed for all patients
   and should be performed as usual, regardless of their BMI. However,
   obese patients should be counseled regarding the higher risk of
   postoperative complications.

AB Objective: This secondary analysis evaluates the logistics of achieving
   vaginal delivery following outpatient induction. This includes changes
   in Bishop score before and after cervical ripening, the need for
   additional ripening agents, time interval from induction to delivery,
   all of which provide invaluable information when developing an
   outpatient induction of labour service. Study design: We randomised
   healthy nulliparous women with no significant medical history, who
   agreed to elective induction of labour at 39 weeks' gestation, to one of
   three forms of initial cervical ripening at home: 12 h of Dilapan-S, 24
   h of Dilapan-S, or 24 h of slow-release dinoprostone (Propess). Patients
   returned to the hospital after 12 or 24 h for either amniotomy or, if
   the cervix remained unripe, additional doses of Prostin. We present our
   experience with the development of a regulated protocol for outpatient
   induction of labour, as well as safety considerations, in order to
   assist those wishing to adopt such practice. Effectiveness of each
   induction agent, time to delivery, and length of hospital stay were
   assessed as part of this secondary analysis. Results: A total of 180/271
   (66%) of all nulliparous women were delivered within 48 h of induction
   commencing, and 254/271 (94%) delivered within 72 h, inclusive of the
   time period spent at home. Participants in the Propess group were more
   likely to require early readmission than in the Dilapan-S groups (45% vs
   9%). Patients randomised to Dilapan-S 12 hand Dilapan-S 24 h were more
   likely to require additional Prostin prior to amniotomy being possible
   (65% vs 34%). Those who did not require additional ripening had very
   high vaginal delivery rates ranging from 80% to 88%. Induction agent
   removal time to delivery was similar across all groups. The length of
   hospital stay ranged from a median of 76 to 88 h from readmission to
   discharge. Conclusion: Outpatient cervical ripening is an efficient and
   useful option for dealing with the logistical challenges facing busy
   Labour Wards, with the majority of nulliparous patients delivering
   within 48 h, including time spent at home. This resource-friendly option
   requires less time within the hospital setting for a carefully selected
   cohort.

AB Background: While there is an extensive literature on low-value imaging,
   there is no agreed definition of the concept. However, a clear and
   consistent definition of low-value imaging is crucial for providing
   comparable and targeted research, and for increasing the quality,
   safety, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of imaging
   services. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to provide a
   definition of low-value imaging. Materials and Methods: Review and
   assessment of definitions of low-value care and of practical measures of
   low-value imaging in the literature combined with standard concept
   analysis to elaborate a definition of low-value imaging according to
   standard criteria for definitions, such as precision, non-circularity,
   applicability, (theoretical) justification, and distinctability. The
   applicability of the suggested definition is assessed by testing it on
   practical tasks and examples. Results: Based on a study of definitions
   of low value care and practical measures of low value imaging in the
   literature this study develops a definition of low-value imaging: Low
   value imaging is imaging that does not contribute to reducing the
   overall pain, dysfunction or suffering of the person that is examined
   (compared to alternative actions). Accordingly, low value imaging can
   result in more harm than benefit, may not change the clinical management
   of the patient, or not be costeffective. The suggested definition
   satisfies general criteria for definition, is able to address practical
   tasks and examples of imaging, and can differentiate valuable from
   non-valuable imaging. Conclusion: A clear and consistent definition of
   low-value imaging is provided and is crucial for improving the quality,
   safety, effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of medical
   imaging. The suggested definition can be used to differentiate between
   valuable and non-valuable imaging.

AB The foundations of human wellbeing are laid in early life during the
   preconception stage and the 1,000-days of life from conception to the
   child's second birthday. This period is therefore receiving scrutiny as
   a concept for guiding pregnancy-care innovation and public health
   policy. The Dutch government took responsibility to invest in this. In
   September 2018, the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare, and Sport
   launched the Solid Start action programme. Coordinated nationally, the
   programme is implemented locally through coalitions in all 342 Dutch
   municipalities involving collaboration between medical and social-care
   professionals, policymakers, parents and organisations. The programme
   has generated a nationwide movement in which medical and social-care
   professionals now develop forms of structural collaboration that support
   (future) parents by offering evidence-based interventions that
   simultaneously enhance early healthy human development and prevent
   unwanted pregnancies. Although monitoring of the programme does not
   currently make it possible to address the causal effects of the
   programme itself, lessons can be distilled which have contributed to the
   successful implementation of this nationwide programme. These lessons
   include 1) having and maintaining an unambiguous narrative, 2) creating
   a lasting sense of urgency among stakeholders, and 3) ensuring that the
   programme is multi-sectoral.

AB The scarcity of medical images significantly hampers the advancement of
   artificial intelligence techniques in the medical field. Medical images
   face the issue of inferior training accuracy and efficiency in
   classification tasks due to insufficient labeled data and privacy
   preserving demands. To address these issues, we propose a new and
   efficient federated learning (FL) scheme based on blockchain, called
   FedBG, to generate realistic images to expand the dataset for medical
   image classification. First, we design an enhanced classification-GAN
   (EC-GAN) algorithm based on cross-entropy, which expands the training
   target of the generator from a single improvement of image fidelity to a
   direction related to the classification tasks. EC-GAN increases the
   diversity of generated images and reduces the risk of pattern collapse.
   Second, we improve the generator's loss function, which is guided by the
   cross-entropy loss term of the classifier model and the gradient
   information from the discriminator model, to generate medical images
   with enhanced category features. This design overcomes the limitation of
   traditional GAN that focuses only on image authenticity judgment, and
   achieves the dual optimization of synthetic image and classification
   accuracy. Finally, we propose an improved consensus mechanism based on
   maximum mean discrepancy and data contribution to ensure the consistency
   and security of data in the blockchain. The mechanism optimizes the
   fairness and efficiency of the model training by dynamically evaluating
   the contribution of each participating node, and guarantees the trust
   system of FL. Experiments are performed on two datasets and results
   demonstrate that FedBG reduces the training time by 27-38% and improves
   the accuracy by 0.9-2% compared to existing methods while ensuring data
   privacy and generating high-quality images.

   registration algorithm is proposed in the paper. Firstly, BFGS algorithm
   is used to optimize the normal distribution transform (NDT) algorithm,
   so that the algorithm iterates continuously along the descending
   direction of the gradient, so as to avoid the algorithm falling into
   local extremum and improve the efficiency of coarse registration; then,
   the main curvature, Gaussian curvature and average curvature of the
   point cloud are calculated and fused to descript the local feature of
   the point cloud; finally, the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm
   based on fused curvature feature is used for precise registration of
   point cloud, so as to further improve the registration accuracy. In the
   experiment, the optimized hierarchical point cloud registration
   algorithm is used for public point cloud registration, skull point cloud
   detection and matching. The results show that, compared with existed
   registration algorithms, the proposed algorithm can effectively improve
   the accuracy and convergence speed of point cloud registration, and
   achieve accurate detection and matching of skull point cloud.

AB The current study examined qualitative data from hospice clinicians'
   perspectives on language, surrounding end-of-life (EOL), to understand
   challenges and opportunities for constructing a trajectory of
   communication leading towards a good death experience. Findings from two
   focus groups with nine clinicians' and 12 individual interviews, four of
   which were follow up interviews after the focus groups, were guided by
   framework analysis and revealed three themes, constructing language
   choices, roles and responsibilities, and socio-cultural considerations.
   We used the Opportunity Model for Presence during the End-of-Life
   Process (OMP-EOLP) to make sense of the findings and discuss
   implications for language use throughout the EOL process. We argue
   additional efforts should be made in recognizing the value of presence
   checks, re-constructing advance care planning, and utilizing different
   forms of media as an educational tool and connection mechanism for
   clinicians with patients and families to achieve a timely engagement of
   EOL conversations for all healthcare participants.

AB This article presents a conformal multi-channel
   multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) antenna designed for a leadless
   transcatheter pacing system (TPS), operating across the medical implants
   communications services (MICS) band (401-406 MHz), the wireless medical
   telemetry services (WMTS) bands (0.608 GHz and 1.4 GHz), and the
   industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) bands (0.433 GHz, 0.915 GHz,
   and 2.45 GHz). The proposed antenna has a size of 19 mm x 10 mm x 0.068
   mm (0.047 lambda(g) x 0.025 lambda(g) x 0.0001 lambda(g)), and it is
   constructed on a thin polyimide substrate and wrapped around the TPS
   capsule's inner wall, efficiently utilizing the inner space. For the
   simulation, the proposed antenna and TPS capsule containing dummy
   electronics are positioned within a homogeneous three-layered phantom
   (skin-fat-heart) with dielectric properties that mimic the human heart,
   as well as in a realistic heterogeneous voxel model (Gustav). The
   antenna is validated for a real environment using an ex-vivo setup
   comprised of fabricating the antenna prototype and measuring its
   performance metrics inside pork meat and phantom solution. The proposed
   MIMO antenna offers good isolation (>25 dB) between antenna elements,
   and the impedance bandwidths are 710 MHz (0.34 to 1.05 GHz), 560 MHz
   (1.26 to 1.82 GHz), and 990 MHz (2.01 to 3 GHz). Further, MIMO
   characteristics are evaluated, and antenna robustness and safety are
   tested by considering specific absorption rates using human voxel
   models. The proposed MIMO antenna is the thinnest conformal antenna
   designed to cover essential biotelemetry frequency bands, including low
   frequencies of 0.402 GHz and 0.433 GHz with circular polarization, which
   significantly reduces power consumption and improves transmission range,
   making it a viable candidate for wireless TPS applications.

AB Many previous studies have found that social participation improves the
   health and functional maintenance of older people. However, to determine
   whether promoting social participation can prevent functional decline in
   the elderly, it is necessary not only to compare the prognosis of those
   who participate in social activities to those who do not but also to
   demonstrate that the intervention was effective in promoting social
   participation. Although the effect of social participation in preventing
   caregiving has been demonstrated, the key question is whether preventing
   functional decline through social participation can reduce care costs.
   This study aims to examine the relationship between participation in
   salons aimed at care prevention through the promotion of social
   participation and the subsequent cost of care. We use the Japan
   Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) dataset to conduct longitudinal,
   individuallevel analysis. We focus on all residents 65 years and older
   who did not have a without disability in Taketoyo town and ran three
   regression analyses. First, a generalized linear model (GLM) with
   Tweedie distribution and log-link function, as well as robust estimation
   of variance components was used to estimate the dependent variables.
   Second, we used an inverse probability weighting (IPW) model to minimize
   selection bias. Finally, we performed the IV analysis. In this study,
   the GLM with IPW and IV models revealed link between salon participants
   and lower caregiving costs. The link between participation and
   caregiving costs was confirmed in a model with reduced selection bias,
   rather than in a simple GLM model.

AB Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a common disease among the elderly.
   Although its pathogenesis remains unclear by now, it is widely accepted
   that ARHL is associated with the degenerative alterations within each
   component of the cochlea. Extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a crucial
   role in cochlear structure and function, providing not only structural
   support but also participating in vital physiological processes
   including the development, differentiation, survival of auditory sensory
   cells, and sound perception. ECM is implicated in the pathogenesis of
   various neurodegenerative diseases, with certain ECM proteins or
   associated molecules emerging as potential therapeutic targets. However,
   few research were carried out on ECM in the cochlea and ECM associated
   molecules in ARHL. This review aims to delineate the composition of ECM
   in the cochlea, the changes of the main ECM structure in the cochlea
   such as the tectorial membrane (TM), the basilar membrane (BM) and the
   spiral ligament (SL) during aging, as well as the role of ECM associated
   molecules in ARHL. We hope that this review will foster further research
   into ARHL.

AB It has attracted considerable attention in the detection of salivary
   miRNAs for the non-invasive diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma
   (OSCC). Herein, we report an innovative magnetic separation-assisted
   auto-cyclic primer extension (MS-ACPE) for label-free and sensitive
   detection of miRNA-31 in human saliva. In this work, low-abundance
   miRNA-31 is initially transduced into primers that can be selectively
   separated and concentrated using a simple magnetic separation
   technology. By leveraging the high local concentration, the recognition
   and capture events between the primers and the hairpin can be greatly
   enhanced. Consequently, a "bind-copy- release" cycle can be effectively
   initiated, generating a user-prescribed, ultra-long single-stranded DNA
   with numerous repetitive quadruplex sequences. This allows for directly
   lighting up the fluorescence of thioflavin T, enabling amplified
   detection of miRNA-31. We experimentally demonstrate that MS-ACPE
   exhibits high specificity and sensitivity for miRNA-31, with a limit of
   detection as low as 0.31 pM. Furthermore, its reliability and
   applicability for the detection of miRNA-31 in saliva samples have been
   explored. More importantly, this novel MS-ACPE can effectively
   discriminate cancer patients from clinical samples with high accuracy
   (AUC = 1), potentially opening new avenues for the non-invasive
   diagnosis of OSCC in clinical applications.

AB Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global medical concern and has a
   lasting impact on brain activity with high risks of mortality. Current
   treatments are inadequate for repairing damaged brain cells or
   correcting cognitive and behavioral disabilities in TBI patients.
   Mounting evidence links TBI to the activation of the Integrated Stress
   Response (ISR) signaling in the brain. A novel small molecule, ISRIB, is
   an effective inhibitor of the ISR pathway, offering potential advantages
   for brain health. Here, we investigated how ISRIB affects brain
   transcriptome and behavior in zebrafish TBI model evoked by
   telencephalic brain injury. Overall, while TBI diminished memory and
   social behavior in zebrafish, administering ISRIB post-injury markedly
   reduced these behavioral deficits, and modulated brain gene expression,
   rescuing TBI-activated pathways related to inflammation and brain cell
   development. Collectively, this supports the role of brain ISR in TBI,
   and suggests potential utility of ISRIB for the treatment of TBI-related
   states.

AB Background: Elderly patients with advanced gastric cancer have poor
   prognoses. This study aims to develop a prediction model for long-term
   survival after radical surgery and to identify patients who may benefit
   from chemotherapy. Methods: Data from 555 elderly patients with advanced
   gastric cancer admitted to two medical centers from 2009 to 2018 were
   retrospectively analyzed. Sarcopenia was combined with the Controlling
   Nutritional Status (CONUT) score to create a modified nutritional index
   (mCONUT). Cox regression analyses were used to develop a novel nomogram
   prediction model (mCNS) that combined mCONUT, pN, and tumor size, and
   its performance was further verified both internally and externally.
   Results: Multivariate Cox analysis revealed that tumor size, pN, and
   mCONUT were independent prognostic risk factors for overall survival
   (OS). The mCNS model showed good fit and high predictive value (AUC:
   training set 0.711; validation set 0.707), outperforming the pTNM model
   (p < 0.05). To further investigate the association between the model and
   adjuvant chemotherapy, we categorized the model into two risk groups: a
   high-risk group and a low-risk group. Further analysis revealed that, in
   the low-risk group, the OS and recurrence-free survival (RFS) for
   patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly better than
   that of those who did not receive chemotherapy (p = 0.047,p = 0.019). In
   the high-risk group, this result was not observed (p = 0.120, p =
   0.053). Conclusion: The mCNS model has high predictive value in
   predicting long-term survival of elderly patients with advanced gastric
   cancer. Patients with mCNS-L were able to benefit from chemotherapy
   after laparoscopic radical gastrectomy.

AB PurposeThe aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of
   almond consumption on peripheral vascular function, ambulant blood
   pressure profiles (ABP), and serum/plasma markers reflecting endothelial
   dysfunction and inflammation in participants with overweight/obesity and
   prediabetes.MethodsThirty-four participants completed this
   single-blinded, randomized, cross-over trial with 5-month intervention
   and control periods, separated by a 2-month wash-out. During the
   intervention period, participants consumed 50 g of whole almonds daily.
   At the end of each intervention period, peripheral vascular function was
   assessed by measuring the carotid-to-femoral and carotid-to-radial pulse
   wave velocities (PWVc-f and PWVc-r, respectively) and retinal
   microvascular calibers. Serum/plasma concentrations of soluble
   intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell
   adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), serum amyloid A protein (SAA) and
   high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and 24-hour ABP were also
   analyzed.ResultsAlmond consumption did not significantly affect arterial
   stiffness (PWVc-f and PWVc-r), while central retinal venular equivalent
   (CRVE) was minimally increased by 2 mu m (P = 0.019). Central retinal
   arteriolar equivalent (CRAE), the arteriolar-to-venular ratio (AVR), and
   endothelial and inflammatory serum/plasma markers showed no significant
   changes after almond consumption. Almond consumption reduced systolic
   blood pressure (SBP; -3 mmHg 24-hour P = 0.035, -4 mmHg daytime P =
   0.046, and - 4 mmHg during nighttime P = 0.029), SBP variability during
   24-hour, daytime, and nighttime (P = 0.005, P = 0.019, and P = 0.003,
   respectively), and diastolic blood pressure variability during nighttime
   (P <= 0.001).ConclusionAlmond consumption did not affect arterial
   stiffness, retinal microvasculature calibers, or serum and plasma
   markers for endothelial dysfunction and inflammation in participants
   with prediabetics, while BP and BP variability were improved.Clinical
   trial registrationThis clinical trial was registered in February 2018 as

AB BackgroundThe global climate crisis requires a paradigm shift in dietary
   concepts, respecting the needs of children. A global reference diet has
   been suggested by the EAT-Lancet Commission. On this basis, the detailed
   "Planetary Health Diet Index" (PHDI) has been proposed. The objective of
   this assessment is (1) to apply the PHDI to the Food-Based Dietary
   Guidelines, the so-called Optimized Mixed Diet (OMD) for children and
   adolescents in Germany in its original composition and (2) to check how
   the planetary value of the OMD could be improved by modifying food
   selection within meals while keeping the high nutrient densities of the
   guideline diet.MethodsThe PHDI specifies 16 food groups and their
   proportion of total daily energy intake. The PHDI of the original OMD
   was calculated by assigning the foods of the 7-day menu to the PHDI food
   groups in order to score them. In this way, it became apparent which
   food groups had the potential to improve the sustainability. The diet
   was then updated by either reducing or increasing individual foods from
   these food groups in the meals and deriving the resulting PHDI. The
   nutrient densities of the original and updated daily OMD were
   calculated.ResultsThe original diet obtained a PHDI score of 68.24
   points, representing 45.5% of the theoretical maximum of 150 points. The
   following food groups achieved 9.9 to 10 out of 10 points: fruits, total
   vegetables, fish & seafood, vegetable oils, chicken (and substitutes).
   Conversely, food groups receiving a zero score included tubers &
   potatoes, dairy, red meat, animal fat, and added sugars. The updated
   diet resulted in increased consumption of 'nuts & peanuts', 'legumes',
   'green vegetables', 'whole grains', and decreased consumption of 'tubers
   & potatoes' and 'red meat'. Overall, the PHDI increased from 68.24 to
   81.51 points with the updated OMD, reflecting a 13.27% increase compared
   to the original diet. The nutrient densities were not significantly
   affected, but even slightly increased for most nutrients.ConclusionsThe
   PHDI was applied to demonstrate how the sustainability of the guideline
   diet for children and adolescents in Germany could be improved through
   changes in individual food groups that can be easily implemented in
   practice while maintaining high nutrient densities and acceptability for
   children.Trial registrationNA.

AB PurposeThis study aimed to investigate the role of a newly isolated
   strain L.reuteri LY2-2 in colitis in mice and explored the underlying
   mechanisms.Methods L.reuteriLY2-2 was orally administered to mice with
   dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. 5-Aminosalicylic acid
   (5-ASA) treatment was used as the drug control.ResultsThe results showed
   that the disease severity of colitis mice was significantly alleviated.
   The intestinal inflammation was restricted by synergistically reducing
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, inhibiting TLR4-NF-kappa B signaling,
   restoring the abnormal immune response, and enhancing intestinal barrier
   function. Of note, L.reuteri LY2-2 showed great potential in modulating
   macrophages polarization in colonic tissues. Moreover, the gut dysbiosis
   was improved. The potentially pro-inflammatory pathogenic bacteria such
   as Helicobacter and Romboutsia decreased and the probiotics including
   L.rhamnosus and L.plantarum increased. Interestingly, the above
   pathological indexes in the L.reuteri LY2-2 group were better than those
   in the 5-ASA group.ConclusionL.reuteri LY2-2 had a better protective
   effect on DSS-induced colitis via its anti-inflammatory and
   microbiota-balancing properties, which supports the potential value of
   this probiotic against colitis. These results contribute to product
   development of functional probiotics for colitis and provide valuable
   insights for their mechanisms of biological function to affect human
   health status.

AB Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and alcohol use disorder
   (AUD) are leading psychiatric causes of burden of disease. Although
   research has found pronounced gender differences in these disorders, the
   magnitude of these differences varies substantially between settings.
   However, integrated analyses of both disorders are lacking, limiting the
   comparability of findings. Moreover, few studies conceptualize political
   and socio-cultural characteristics as separate macro-level determinants
   of gender differences. This paper analyzes the association between
   gender differences in the prevalence of both MDD and AUD with social
   policy expenditures and indicators of gender equality. Methods: Data for
   adults from the U.S. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
   2006/2008 (n = 234,020) and the European Social Survey 2014 (n = 30,416)
   were used. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted using modified
   Poisson regression models adjusted for individual-level and macro-level
   covariates; multiplicative and additive interaction were evaluated.
   Results: Social policy expenditures and support for gender equality were
   negatively associated with gender differences in AUD in Europe (p <
   0.001), with the male excess prevalence varying between 26.1 % at lowest
   and 9.4 % at highest observed levels of expenditures, and between 23.3 %
   at lowest and 6.8 % at highest levels of gender equality. In the U.S.,
   state-level reproductive rights were negatively associated with gender
   differences in AUD (p = 0.036). No equivalent effects were observed for
   gender differences in MDD. Conclusion: The prevalence of AUD among men
   and women tends to converge in settings with higher levels of social
   policy generosity and gender equality, respectively. This effect does
   not seem to apply to gender differences in MDD in either setting.

AB Depression occurs in up to 13 % of all pregnancies and is associated
   with adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the literature regarding
   associations between depression and lower birth weight or fetal growth
   has been inconsistent. Here, we consider if high frequency heart rate
   variability (HF-HRV) may moderate the association between depression and
   birth weight. Lower HF-HRV has been associated with greater risk of
   depression and poorer health outcomes. However, during pregnancy, there
   is a normative decrease in HF-HRV that may be protective. Higher HF-HRV
   is associated with a person's ability to flexibly adapt to challenges.
   During pregnancy, less flexibility may reduce responses to challenges,
   including depression, thereby mitigating the vulnerability of the
   pregnancy to the effects of depression. The present study considers this
   possibility with 80 pregnant women who completed a measure of depressive
   symptoms during pregnancy at 24 to 28, 30 to 32, and 36 to 38 weeks
   gestation, and had HF-HRV measured at 24 to 28 weeks gestation. Fetal
   growth was derived using birth weight and length of gestation data
   gathered from medical charts. Results revealed that for women with
   higher HF-HRV, depressive symptoms were negatively associated with fetal
   growth. This relationship was not evident for women with lower HF-HRV,
   who appeared to be protected from the effects of depression on fetal
   growth. Considering the combined impact of HF-HRV and depression during
   pregnancy may help us better identify women at risk of having lower
   birth weight neonates, and improve our understanding of how depression
   is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB Background: Crisis Intervention Hotline can effectively reduce suicide
   risk, but suffer from low connectivity rates and untimely crisis
   response. By integrating speech signals and deep learning to assist in
   crisis assessment, it is expected to enhanced the effectiveness of
   crisis intervention hotlines. Methods: In this study, a crisis
   intervention hotline suicide risk speech dataset was constructed, and
   the speech was labeled based on the Modified Suicide Risk Scale. On the
   dataset, the variability of speech duration between different callers
   and different speech high-level features were explored across callers.
   Finally, this study proposed a data-theoretically dual-driven,
   gender-assisted speech crisis recognition method based on multi-tasking
   and deep learning, and the results of the model were obtained through
   five-fold cross-validation. Results: Analysis of the dataset
   demonstrated gender differences in callers, with male callers speaking
   more in crisis calls compared to females. Feature analysis revealed
   significant differences between crisis callers in terms of emotional
   intensity of speech, speech rate and texture. The proposed method
   outperformed other methods with an F1 score of 96 % on the validation
   data, and feature visualization of the model also demonstrated the
   validity of the method. Limitations: The sample size of this study was
   limited and ignored information from other modalities. Conclusion: These
   findings demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model in speech
   crisis recognition, and the statistical data analysis enhanced the
   Interpretability of the model, while showing that the integration of
   data and theoretical knowledge facilitates the effectiveness of the
   method.

AB Imputation methods for missing data may not always be applicable,
   namely, when the data were completely missing for the whole sample. To
   estimate the missing data, we compared three missing item substitution
   methods: (1) mean substitution; (2) last observation carried forward
   (LOCF); and (3) regression-predicted values. A total of 384 parents
   reported their 8- to 18-year-old children's anxiety level using the
   9-item Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders at baseline (Time 1)
   and two later time points, drawing from a larger longitudinal study
   (Ontario COVID-19 and Kids' Mental Health Study). We predicted a survey
   item measured one month after baseline (Time 2) using: (1) the mean
   value of the rest of the test items; (2) the value of the same item
   measured at baseline; and (3) the predicted value from the linear
   regression with all other test items as predictors. WithinSubjects ANOVA
   results showed a main effect of substitution methods on total score at
   Time 2. Post-hoc analysis indicated that mean substitution was
   significantly different from the actual data. Regression-predicted
   values overestimated the median compared to the actual values, while the
   LOCF estimation produced comparable means and identical medians. Similar
   results were found while using other indicators and extending the
   analysis to a larger 4-month time interval (Time 3), suggesting LOCF is
   more accurate and reliable than mean substitution or
   regression-prediction. This study proposes when advanced substitution
   methods are not applicable, a systematic comparison of alternative
   methods may help researchers to arrive at a more informed decision in
   data processing.

AB Background: Early identification of individuals at high risk for
   depression is essential for effective implementation of interventions.
   This study utilized the UK Biobank database to construct an individual
   depression risk score using nomogram and explored the potential of
   traditional risk factors and routine biochemical markers for the
   auxiliary diagnosis of individual depression. Methods: A total of
   369,407 participants were included in the study and divided into
   training and testing sets. LASSO regression was employed to select
   predictive variables for depression from 16 traditional risk factors and
   28 routine biochemical markers. Following variable selection, two
   multivariable logistic regression models were constructed. Nomograms
   were then generated to visualize the relationships between these
   variables and depression risk, and to facilitate the calculation of
   individual depression risk scores. Results: Twelve traditional risk
   factors and nine biochemical markers were selected for model building.
   Model 1, using only traditional risk factors, achieved the area under
   the curve (AUC) of 0.913 (95 % CI: 0.910-0.915), while Model 2,
   incorporating both traditional and routine biochemical markers, yielded
   an AUC of 0.914 (95 % CI: 0.912-0.917). Based on optimal cut-off values,
   Model 1 exhibited a sensitivity of 81.99 % and a specificity of 83.76 %,
   while Model 2 demonstrated a sensitivity of 81.54 % and a specificity of
   84.31 %. Limitations: External validation is still needed to confirm the
   model's generalizability. Conclusions: While the depression risk scoring
   model built using traditional risk factors effectively identifies
   highrisk individuals for depression and demonstrates good clinical
   performance, incorporating routine biochemical markers did not
   significantly improve the model's performance.

AB Background: We examined exposure to adulthood traumatic life events
   (TLEs) and their associations with depression in women and men. Then we
   examined whether those associations are independent of exposure loading
   and vulnerability including familial confounding. Methods: The fourth
   survey in 2011 of the population-based Finnish Twin Cohort had 8410
   participants (45 % men, mean age 60 years). Using the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale, depression was defined
   using a cut-off value >= 20. Participants reported exposure to TLEs
   during adulthood. Logistic regression adjusted for multiple covariates
   was used as the individual-based analyses. Familial confounding was
   tested using conditional logistic regression in 399 twin pairs
   discordant for depression. Results: More women (15 %) than men (11 %)
   were depressed. Men reported more traffic accidents (men: 11.8 %, women:
   7.4 %), other serious accidents (11.8 %, 5.8 %), and violent crime (3.1
   %, 2.0 %) whereas women reported more sexual assault (0.7 %, 10.6 %).
   Violent crime (Odds Ratio 3.86; 95 % Confidence Intervals 2.59, 5.73),
   sexual assault (3.49; 2.67, 4.55), physical assault (3.10; 2.45, 3.93),
   and other serious accidents (1.36; 1.01, 1.85) were associated with
   depression. These associations, except other serious accidents, remained
   significant after adjusting for multiple covariates including shared
   familial factors. The associations did not differ by sex. Limitations: A
   relatively small set of relevant TLEs was reported retrospectively and
   the order of TLEs was not assessed. Conclusions: Women and men differ in
   exposure to TLEs but, if exposed, they are equally vulnerable for
   depression. Because traumatic life events are robustly associated with
   depression, they should be considered in treatment.

AB Significance: I explore hyperspectral imaging, a rapid and noninvasive
   technique with significant potential in biometrics and medical
   diagnosis. Personal identification was performed using cross-sectional
   hyperspectral images of palms, offering a simpler and more robust method
   than conventional vascular pattern identification methods.
   Aim: I aim to demonstrate the potential of local cross-sectional
   hyperspectral palm images to identify individuals with high accuracy.
   Approach: Hyperspectral imaging of palms, artificial intelligence
   (AI)-based region of interest (ROI) detection, feature vector
   extraction, and dimensionality reduction were utilized to validate
   personal identification accuracy using the area under the curve (AUC)
   and equal error rate (EER).
   Results: The feature vectors extracted by the proposed method
   demonstrated higher intra-cluster similarity when the clustering data
   were reduced through uniform manifold approximation and projection
   compared with principal component analysis and t  -distributed
   stochastic neighbor embedding. A maximum AUC of 0.98 and an EER of 0.04%
   were observed.
   Conclusions: I proposed a biometric method using cross-sectional
   hyperspectral imaging of human palms. The procedure includes AI-based
   ROI detection, feature extraction, dimension reduction, and intra- and
   inter-subject matching using Euclidean distances as a discriminant
   function. The proposed method has the potential to identify individuals
   with high accuracy.

AB This commentary on Sturmberg and Mercuri's paper 'Every Problem is
   Embedded in a Greater Whole' [1] argues that those authors have
   approached complexity from a largely mathematical perspective, drawing
   on the work of Sumpter. Whilst such an approach allows us to challenge
   the simple linear causality assumed in randomised controlled trials, it
   is itself limited. Mathematical complexity can explain nonlinearity and
   network effects but it cannot explain human values. It overlooks, for
   example, how science itself is historically and culturally shaped and
   how values-driven misunderstandings and conflicts are inevitable when
   people with different world views come together to try to solve a
   problem. This paper argues that the mathematical version of complexity
   thinking is necessary but not sufficient in medical research, and that
   we need to enhance such thinking further with attention to human values.

AB Edwardsiella anguillarum and Aeromonas hydrophila are two common
   bacterial pathogens affecting cultivated eels, and the differences in
   their virulence remain unclear. In this study, after two groups of
   American eels (Anguilla rostrata) were administered the LD50 dose of E.
   anguillarum and A. hydrophila, respectively, the histopathology of the
   liver, trunk kidney, and spleen, as well as transcriptomic RNA
   sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of the spleen, was examined at three time
   points: pre-infection (Con group) and post-infection at 36 h (Ea_36
   group, Ah_36 group) and 60 h (Ea_60 group, Ah_60 group). The results
   showed that the differences in pathological changes were characterized
   by severe hepatocyte edema at 36 h post-infection (hpi) and hepatocyte
   atrophy at 60 hpi in the livers of eels infected by A. hydrophila, in
   contrast to the severe atrophy of glomeruli in the trunk kidneys and
   numerous bacterial nodules in the spleens of eels infected by E.
   anguillarum. The RNA-seq results revealed 906 and 77 typical
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in eels infected with E.
   anguillarum and A. hydrophila, respectively, compared to the control
   eels. The DEGs between the infected and control groups were
   predominantly annotated in GO terms related to binding, catalytic
   activity, membrane part, cell part, and cellular process, as well as in
   KEGG pathways associated with human diseases and organismal systems. The
   GO enrichment analysis showed 83 and 146 differential GO terms, along
   with 32 and 78 differential KEGG pathways in two comparisons of Ea_36 vs
   Con versus Ah_36 vs Con and Ea_60 vs Con versus Ah_60 vs Con,
   respectively. Furthermore, the analysis of differential alternative
   splicing genes (DASs) showed 1244 and 1341 DASs out of 12,907 and 12,833
   AS genes, respectively, in the comparisons of Ea_36 vs Ah_36 and Ea_60
   vs Ah_60. These DASs were enriched in two common KEGG pathways:
   "NOD-like receptor signaling pathway" and "necroptosis" which shared 11
   hub DASs. Finally, analysis of protein-protein interactions revealed
   that 91 of 412 cross DASs between Ea_36 vs Ah_36 and Ea_60 vs Ah_60
   potentially play an essential role in the difference in virulence of E.
   anguillarum and A. hydrophila in American eels, with 12 encoded proteins
   being particularly notable. Together, this study is the first to report
   a comparative pathogenicity and RNA-seq analysis of E. anguillarum and
   A. hydrophila in American eels, shedding new light on our understanding
   of the differences in virulence as revealed by pathological changes,
   DEGs, and DASs, contributing to more effective control strategies to
   prevent outbreaks of bacterial infections.

AB Accurate and rapid screening of adenocarcinoma cells in serous cavity
   effusion is vital in diagnosing the stage of metastatic tumors and
   providing prompt medical treatment. However, it is often difficult for
   pathologists to screen serous cavity effusion. Fixed agglutination cell
   block can help to improve diagnostic sensitivity in malignant tumor
   cells through analyzing larger volumes of serous cavity effusion,
   although it could accordingly lead to screening of more cells for
   pathologists. With the advent of whole slide imaging and development of
   artificial intelligence, advanced deep learning models are expected to
   assist pathologists in improving diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. In
   this study, so far as we know, it is the first time to use cell block
   technology combined with a proposed weakly supervised deep learning
   model with multiple instance learning method to screen serous
   adenocarcinoma. The comparative experiments were implemented through
   5-fold cross-validation, and the results demonstrated that our proposed
   model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under weak
   supervision while balancing the number of learnable parameters and
   computational costs and reduces the workload of pathologists but also
   presents a quantitative and interpretable cellular pathologic scene of
   serous adenocarcinoma with superior interpretability and strong
   generalization capability. The performances and features of the model
   indicate its effectiveness in the rapid screening and diagnosis of
   serous cavity effusion and its potential in broad clinical application
   prospects, eg, in precision medical applications. Moreover, the
   constructed 2 real-world pathologic data sets would be the first public
   whole slide imaging data sets of serous cavity effusion with
   adenocarcinoma based on cell block sections, which can help assist
   colleagues. (c) 2024 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf

AB Sepsis is a life-threatening disease characterized by a dysregulated
   immune response to infection, often leading to neuroinflammation. As a
   known immunomodulator, Maresin-1 (MaR1) may have potential applications
   in the treatment of sepsis-induced neuroinflammation, but its effects in
   this context are unknown. We used a mouse cecum ligation and puncture
   (CLP)-induced sepsis model and an in vitro lipopolysaccharide
   (LPS)-induced neuroinflammatory model of BV2 microglia. Expression of
   microglial cell markers (IBA1, CD11B, CD68, CD86 and CD206) and
   pro-inflammatory markers (iNOS and COX2) was assessed. The role of MaR1
   in regulating the P38 MAPK pathway was explored using the P38 MAPK
   inhibitor SB203580. In the CLP model, an increased proportion of M1-type
   microglia was observed, and MaR1 was able to reverse it. However, the
   combination of SB203580 and MaR1 did not enhance the therapeutic effect
   compared to SB20580 alone. In vitro experiments, MaR1 inhibited
   LPS-induced P38 MAPK nuclear translocation and decreased the expression
   of pro-inflammatory markers such as iNOS and COX2. As with the animal
   results, no stacking effect could be obtained with the co-administration
   of SB203580 and MaR1. Our findings suggest that MaR1 attenuates
   sepsis-induced neuroinflammation mainly by inhibiting phosphorylation of
   P38 MAPK in microglial cells. This suggests that MaR1 may have a
   potential therapeutic role in the treatment of sepsis
   neuroinflammation.Graphical AbstractUnder sepsis, the phosphorylation of
   P38 MAPK in the brain is increased, which may cause resting microglia in
   the brain in the transformation to M1-type microglia. At the same time,
   P38 MAPK in microglia translocates to the nucleus and increases its
   phosphorylation level, which may promote microglia to trigger
   neuroinflammation and further induce neuronal degeneration. MaR1 can
   inhibit the above process. This figure was created by Figdraw

AB Among the spectrum of gliomas, glioblastoma stands out as the most
   aggressive brain tumor affecting the central nervous system. In
   addressing this urgent medical challenge, exploring therapeutic
   alternatives becomes imperative to enhance the patient's prognosis. In
   this regard, Butia odorata (BO) fruit emerges as a promising candidate
   due to its array of bioactive compounds, including flavonoids, phenolic
   acids, and carotenoids, known for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,
   and antitumor properties. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the
   impact of standardized hydroalcoholic extract of BO on rat C6 and human
   U87MG glioma cell lines. Cells were exposed to varying extract
   concentrations (125-2000 mu g/mL) for intervals of 0, 2, 4, 6, 24, 48,
   or 72 h. Then, cell viability, proliferation, colony formation, redox
   equilibrium parameters, cell migration, and the relative mRNA expression
   of genes related to gliomagenesis were evaluated. Our findings revealed
   a reduction in viability, proliferation, colony formation, reactive
   oxygen species, and nitrite levels in both glioma cell lines upon
   exposure to the extract. Conversely, an increase in sulfhydryl content
   and the activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase were observed in
   both glioma cell lines. No significant changes in viability and
   proliferation were observed in astrocytes. Furthermore, in the C6 cells
   only, the BO extract reduced the migration and downregulated the
   relative mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2,
   O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, nuclear factor-kappa B,
   interleukin-6 genes, and upregulated caspase-3 gene. These results
   underscore the promising anti-glioma potential of BO extract, attributed
   to its diverse bioactive composition.

AB Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's
   diseases, share key characteristics, notably cognitive impairment and
   significant cell death in specific brain regions. Cognition, a complex
   mental process allowing individuals to perceive time and place, is
   disrupted in these conditions. This consistent disruption suggests the
   possibility of a shared underlying mechanism across all
   neurodegenerative diseases. One potential common factor is the
   activation of pathways leading to cell death. Despite significant
   progress in understanding cell death pathways, no definitive treatments
   have emerged. This has shifted focus towards less-explored mechanisms
   like ferroptosis, which holds potential due to its involvement in
   oxidative stress and iron metabolism. Unlike apoptosis or necrosis,
   ferroptosis offers a novel therapeutic avenue due to its distinct
   biochemical and genetic underpinnings, making it a promising target in
   neurodegenerative disease treatment. Ferroptosis is distinguished from
   other cellular death mechanisms, by distinctive characteristics such as
   an imbalance of iron hemostasis, peroxidation of lipids in the plasma
   membrane, and dysregulated glutathione metabolism. In this review, we
   discuss the potential role of ferroptosis in cognitive impairment. We
   then summarize the evidence linking ferroptosis biomarkers to cognitive
   impairment brought on by neurodegeneration while highlighting recent
   advancements in our understanding of the molecular and genetic
   mechanisms behind the condition. Finally, we discuss the prospective
   therapeutic implications of targeting ferroptosis for the treatment of
   cognitive abnormalities associated with neurodegeneration, including
   natural and synthetic substances that suppress ferroptosis via a variety
   of mechanisms. Promising therapeutic candidates, including antioxidants
   and iron chelators, are being explored to inhibit ferroptosis and
   mitigate cognitive decline.

AB Adult dogs and cats in overweight or obese condition are common, but
   prevalence data for different life stages, especially growth, are
   limited, and may help inform when preventative measures may be most
   effective. In this retrospective observational study, prevalences of
   overweight and obese condition were determined from the electronic
   medical records of dogs and cats of all life stages visiting Banfield
   Pet Hospital in the USA between 2020 and 2023. Animals were identified
   either by body condition score (BCS; overweight 6-7; obese 8-9) or from
   a clinical diagnosis of overweight condition or obesity when recorded.
   Life stages (early growth, late growth, young adult, adult, mature, and
   senior) were defined by age range, adjusted for species and breed size
   in dogs. Individuals could only be included once within each life stage,
   with the maximum BCS used. Prevalence was determined for the 4-year
   period and for each calendar year. The evolution of BCS was also
   assessed for animals with multiple records. In total, 4933,916 unique
   dogs and 1341,118 unique cats were included. In dogs, prevalences of
   overweight or obese condition were: 0.9 % and < 0.0 % (early growth),
   9.5 % and 0.3 % (late growth), 24.4 % and 1.9 % (young adult); 44.5 %
   and 8.4 % (adult), 50.1 % and 12.6 % (mature); 46.4 % and 11.3 %
   (senior). In cats, prevalences of overweight or obese condition were:
   0.8 % and < 0.0 % (early growth); 10.7 % and 0.4 % (late growth); 36.2 %
   and 3.6 % (young adult); 47.2 % and 13.9 % (adult); 44.8 % and 21.7 %
   (mature); and 32.0 % and 12.6 % (senior). From 2020-2021 and 2021-2022
   prevalences of overweight and obese condition in dogs and overweight
   condition in cats increased in most life stages. The prevalence of
   overweight condition in dogs and obese condition in cats and dogs
   significantly decreased between 2022 and 2023 for some life stages. The
   odds ratio of an overweight or obese condition in adulthood was 1.85 (95
   % confidence interval [CI]: 1.81, 1.86); P <= 0.001) for dogs and 1.52
   (95 % CI: 1.48, 1.56; P <= 0.001) for cats where an overweight or obese
   condition was recorded during growth. In conclusion, both overweight and
   obese condition are prevalent throughout adult life, peaking during the
   mature life stage in dogs and cats, with overweight or obese condition
   during growth persisting into adulthood in most affected animals.
   Veterinarian-led prevention strategies are recommended from growth
   onwards, including the use of growth standard charts.

   and they learn mathematics in the school context in the societal
   language (Italian in the present study). More evidence is needed on how
   Heritage Bilinguals (HBs) perform in different subtypes of numeracy and
   mathematics skills in a longitudinal perspective. This longitudinal
   study aimed to analyze the mathematical skills of heritage bilingual
   children. 220 HBs (50.5% female, from different linguistic/ethnic
   groups, including Indo-Iranian, Arabic, Chinese, Romanian, Albanian and
   Slavic languages) and 440 monolinguals (46.8% female, mostly Italian)
   were followed from second to third grade (aged between 7 and 9 years).
   The following tasks were administered: dictation, symbolic comparison,
   number line, mental calculation, multiplication tables, approximate
   calculation, problem-solving and written calculations. The results
   showed an advantage for HBs in approximate calculation, but they
   underperformed in problem-solving, multiplication tables, and mental
   calculations. A profile analysis highlighted the percentages of children
   at risk for math impairment. The study provides a longitudinal profile
   of strengths and weaknesses in the mathematics profile of children with
   HBs, with developmental trajectories that vary according to verbal load.
   The discussion focuses on the role of verbal load in math tasks in the
   assessment of HBs, and implications for clinical and educational
   contexts.

AB Extensive research highlights the multifaceted benefits of active
   musical engagement across all ages, from childhood to the elderly. The
   practice of a musical instrument activates numerous brain regions,
   enhancing a range of neurocognitive skills. Despite accumulating
   evidence from various clinical populations, research on the effects of
   musical training in individuals with ADHD is scarce, with virtually no
   studies focusing on adults. This study aims to fill the gap by
   evaluating the impact of long-term instrumental music training on
   cognitive abilities in young adults (18-35 years) diagnosed with ADHD.
   Cognitive abilities were compared across groups of 48 musicians
   (experienced guitar or piano players) and 46 matched non-musicians, all
   confirmed to have ADHD. The assessments covered cognitive domains such
   as sustained attention, visuospatial processing, processing speed,
   graphomotor speed, working memory, auditory recall, response inhibition,
   and executive function. Evaluation tools included the Digit-Symbol
   Coding Test, Digit Span Test, Symbol Search Test, Switching Task, and
   Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Collectively, the results indicated a
   notable enhancement in cognitive performance in the musician group
   compared to the non-musician group, including in functions central to
   the disorder, such as sustained attention and impulse control. Musicians
   scored higher on the Digit-Symbol Coding, Digit Span, and Symbol Search
   tests, showed lower error rates and greater consistency in reaction
   times in the Switching Task, and had fewer commission errors in the CPT.
   The findings support the integration of specialized musical training in
   therapeutic and support programs for ADHD, suggesting benefits that may
   extend into adulthood.

AB Mycotic aneurysms are a rare but potentially life-threatening
   complication of infections, particularly those involving the spine.
   Spondylodiscitis, a bacterial or fungal infection of the intervertebral
   disc, is a known risk factor for the development of mycotic aneurysms.
   Early diagnosis and prompt treatment are crucial for improving patient
   outcomes. We report the case of a 79-year-old patient with a history of
   diabetes admitted for chronic back pain refractory to medical treatment.
   A cervico-thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan showed infectious
   spondylodiscitis at the lumbar level complicated by a mycotic aneurysm
   of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. This case highlights the diagnostic
   challenges associated with mycotic aneurysms, particularly when they
   arise from a contiguous infectious focus. Imaging modalities, such as
   computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), play a
   pivotal role in identifying these aneurysms and assessing their extent.
   The patient underwent surgical management of the spondylodiscitis and
   the mycotic aneurysm. A stent was placed to reinforce the weakened
   aortic wall and prevent rupture. Postoperative management included
   long-term antibiotic therapy to eradicate the infection. The patient
   experienced a favorable outcome, with resolution of symptoms and
   improved quality of life.

   prevalence of aural plaques in Mangalarga Marchador (MM) and Quarter
   Horse (QH) horses in Brazil, to evaluate the association of this
   prevalence with some risk factors, and to detect the presence of EcPV
   DNA (types 1-10) in aural plaques biopsies. A total of 400 MM and 425 QH
   horses, were clinically evaluated. For each horse, an identification
   form was completed, containing information on breeding, sex, age,
   presence, and classification of aural plaque lesions, presence of
   ectoparasites, management type, ear clipping performed, and sensitivity
   to ear palpation. Biopsies of the lesions were taken from 30 horses and
   assessed for the presence of EcPV DNA using PCR. Among the MM and QH
   horses evaluated, 41.5% and 33.6%, respectively, had aural plaques. The
   MM horses showed a higher frequency of plaques than QH (p = 0.02). At
   least one viral type was identified in 90% of all aural plaque biopsies,
   with EcPV4 being the most frequently detected in both breeds, followed
   by EcPV6, EcVP5, EcVP3 and EcPV1 respectively. In one sample, EcPV1 was
   detected alone, although it had previously been described only in
   copresence. The copresence of viral DNA the MM 73% (11/15) QH 27% (4/15)
   horses. Aural plaques are widely distributed, with a higher prevalence
   of EcPV4. Additionally, MM horses have higher susceptibility and
   frequency of the disease than QH horses.

AB Background: Differences in the recording of cancer case status and
   diagnosis date have been observed between cancer registry (CR) - the
   reference standard - and electronic health records (EHRs); such
   differences may affect estimates of cancer risk or misclassify
   diagnostic pathways. This study aims to quantify differences in
   recording of case status and date of cancer diagnosis between cancer
   registry and EHRs. Methods: Linked primary care (Clinical Practice
   Research Datalink (CPRD)), secondary care (Hospital Episode Statistics
   (HES)) and national Cancer Registry (CR) data, were used to identify
   14,301 patients with a recorded diagnosis of brain, colon, lung,
   ovarian, or pancreatic cancer between 1999 and 2018. Agreement in case
   status between datasets, differences in recorded diagnosis dates, and
   change in agreement over time were investigated for each cancer site.
   Results: Between 84 % (ovary) to 92 % (colon) of diagnoses in cancer
   registry were also recorded in combined CPRD-HES data. Agreement with
   cancer registry was slightly lower in HES (78 % (ovary) to 86 % (colon))
   and CPRD (61 % (ovary, pancreas) to 72 % (brain)). The proportion of
   CPRD-HES diagnoses confirmed in CR varied by cancer site (50 % (brain)
   to 86 % (lung)). Agreement between CR and HES was relatively stable
   within cancer sites over time. Concordance between CR and CPRD was more
   heterogeneous between cancer sites and over time. Best agreement in
   diagnosis date was observed between CR and HES (median difference 0 or 1
   days, all cancer sites). Conclusion: Agreement between CR and EHR data
   is heterogeneous across cancer sites. Concordance does not appear to
   have improved over time. Combined data from primary and secondary care
   may be sufficient to approximate case status in CR in some
   circumstances, but the date we consider to represent the diagnosis may
   impact study outcomes.

AB The rising incidence of chronic diseases and the outbreak of infectious
   diseases have posed significant challenges to regional healthcare
   systems. As critical institutions within these systems, hospitals
   urgently need effective monitoring of their status and developing
   strategies to ensure their continued operation. This study introduces
   the concept of hospital robustness and investigates the ability of
   hospitals to maintain normal operations and provide continuous,
   efficient medical services under conditions of patient surges. Utilizing
   a cascade model, we construct a patient-sharing network to simulate the
   patient consultation and referral processes between doctors and explore
   the impact of different referral strategies on hospital robustness.
   Firstly, based on the daily new patient numbers, an analytical framework
   was proposed to classify hospital operational states into three phases
   (no-loss phase, stable phase, and fluctuating phase). Then, two referral
   strategies were considered: two edge-weighted and completely random
   referral strategies. When the edge-weighted referral strategy was
   implemented with lower values, the total average referral count (TAR)
   and total number of lost patients (TLP) reached their minimum without
   referral preferences, which helped reduce patient loss. Under the
   utterly random referral strategy, referring patients randomly to other
   doctors alleviated the workload of individual doctors and contributed to
   reducing patient loss. It was also observed that when the limit on
   referral times was low, the effectiveness of referral strategies
   diminished, highlighting the need to encourage multiple referrals.

AB Background: Thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography
   (TI-SPECT) imaging has been used historically to distinguish malignant
   cerebral neoplasms from infectious etiologies. Objectives: Our study
   aims to conduct a retrospective study, review existing literature, and
   perform meta-analysis on the use of TI-SPECT to differentiate malignant
   from non-malignant nervous system lesions when other advanced imaging
   modalities are not available, such as in resource-limited setting.
   Methods: A retrospective study on the use of TI-SPECT in differentiating
   malignant versus nonmalignant nervous system lesions was conducted in
   two tertiary hospitals in the Philippines. A systematic review of
   relevant studies regarding TI-SPECT for the central nervous system was
   also done. Meta-analysis was performed to generate pooled sensitivity
   and specificity. Results: A total of 19 patients from 2 institutions
   were included in the analysis. Data from Philippine General Hospital
   showed a sensitivity of 83% (95% CI: 36%, 100%) and a specificity of
   100% (95% CI: 16%, 100%), while St. Luke's Medical Center had a
   sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 40%, 100%) and specificity of 100% (95% CI:
   48%, 100%). Thirty-two (32) articles were qualitatively described and 24
   datasets were subjected to metaanalysis. Pooled sensitivity and
   specificity were 89% (95% CI: 81%-94%) and 81% (95% CI: 73%-87%),
   respectively with an area under the curve (AUC) for diagnostic accuracy
   of 92%. Conclusion: TI-SPECT imaging may be a potential diagnostic tool
   to discriminate malignant from non-malignant nervous system lesions when
   advanced imaging modalities such as PET/ MRI are not available. Due to
   the heterogeneity of the population in the studies included in both the
   quantitative and qualitative analyses, further studies are needed to
   validate these findings.

AB Introduction: Gestation is a critical period for fetal brain
   development, and extreme heat exposure during this stage may have
   adverse impact on neurodevelopment in children. However, current
   evidence is scarce. Methods: We examined the associations between
   maternal exposure to heat wave during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental
   delay in young children in a birth cohort study of 67,453 child-mother
   pairs from Foshan, China. Specifically, temperature data (spatial
   resolution: 0.0625 degrees x 0.0625 degrees) were assigned to study
   participants based on residential addresses. Then, heat wave events were
   defined by combining the intensity (temperature thresholds: >= 90th,
   92.5th or 95th percentile) and duration (number of consecutive days: 2,
   3 or 4 days). Neurodevelopmental status was assessed using a five-domain
   scale by trained medical professionals. Logistic regression was used to
   investigate the associations between gestational heat wave exposure and
   neurodevelopmental delay in children. Results: We found that exposure to
   heat wave during early and late pregnancy was associated with increased
   risks of neurodevelopmental delay in children. By contrast, the results
   for mid-pregnancy heat wave exposure were mixed. The observed
   associations remained stable in a group of sensitivity analyses.
   Conclusions: Our study adds some suggestive evidence that prenatal
   exposure to heat wave may have detrimental impact on children's
   neurodevelopment. More investigations are needed to verify our findings.

AB Introduction: Suicide is a major social issue in Korea. Suicide attempt
   or self-harm (SA/SH)-a risk factor for suicides-is in itself a major
   public health problem. Investigating vulnerable populations is the first
   step for designing an effective prevention program. This study aimed to
   investigate the epidemiology and outcomes of patients with severe
   injuries related to suicide attempts or self-harm (SA/SH) by age groups,
   using a nationwide database. Materials and Methods: This retrospective
   observational study was conducted in Korea between 2016 and 2020. Its
   participants were patients with severe injuries, who were treated by
   emergency medical service (EMS). From among injured patients who met the
   criteria for a field-based injury triage scheme or had a prehospital
   physiological abnormality, those with SA/SH were included. Exposure was
   based on age groups: adolescents (10-18 years), adults (19-64 years),
   and older adults (>= 65 years). The study's outcomes were in-hospital
   mortality. Patients' characteristics and outcomes were compared by age
   groups and SA/SH mechanisms. Predictors of mortality were investigated
   using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: Among the
   204,211 patients with severe injuries transferred by EMS, 43,945 (21.5
   %) were SA/SHrelated. Their median (interquartile) age was 48 (35-61)
   years, and 52.9 % were female patients. The common SA/SH mechanisms
   were: poisoning (67.6 %), hanging (16.3 %), and jumping (8.1 %).
   Overall, the mortality was 21.9 %, but it was higher for hanging (69.2
   %) and jumping (62.0 %), than for common poisoning (6.5 %). Among
   adolescents, poisoning (46.1 %), followed by jumping (34.0 %) was
   common, and the mortality was 23.3 %. In the older adults, poisoning
   (68.6 %), followed by hanging (20.2 %) was common, and the mortality was
   34.9 %. Older adults compared to adults, males compared to females, and
   hanging and jumping compared to poisoning, were associated with higher
   mortality. Conclusions: More than 20 % of EMS treated patients with
   severe injury were SA/SH-related, and the mortality was over 20 %.
   Although poisoning was the most common mechanism, the high proportions
   of jumping and hanging with high mortality, resulted in adolescents and
   the older adults groups having high mortality. Therefore, designing
   target-specific SA/SH prevention programs based on age, sex, and common
   SA/SH mechanisms are necessary.

AB Background: Due to lack of knowledge and misunderstanding, parents may
   mismanage a fever and seek unnecessary medical attention. Aim: The study
   aimed to determine the effectiveness of video and booklet discharge
   instructions for childhood fever in the pediatric emergency department.
   Methods: This randomized controlled trial (NCT05929131) consisted of
   three groups: video (n = 48), booklet (n = 48), and verbal (n = 48)
   discharge instructions. Data were collected using the Introductory
   Information Form, Parent's Childhood Fever Management, Post-Discharge
   Coping Difficulties Scale for Parents, and Post-Discharge Information
   Form. Results: Within the first 3 days after receiving discharge
   instructions, parents in the video group had lower scores on the
   Parents' Fever Management Scale (video: 20.29 f 1.99, booklet: 20.65 f
   2.07, verbal: 28.41 f 1.51; p < 0.05) and the Post-Discharge Coping
   Difficulties Scale for Parents (video: 39.44 f 3.91, verbal: 54.03 f
   9.12; p = 0.019) compared to the verbal group. After discharge, the
   number of hospital readmissions was lower in the video group of parents
   compared to the verbal group (video: 1.12 f 0.44, verbal: 1.54 f 0.96, p
   = 0.015). Conclusion: Visual discharge instructions, such as booklets
   and videos to support discharge instructions, have been shown to be
   effective in improving mothers' fever management skills and reducing
   their return to the emergency department.

AB Background: Like in all posterior fossa surgeries the avoidance of
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks is of paramount importance for foramen
   magnum decompression in Chiari I malformation in children. The present
   technical note decribes the experience with the creation of a T-shaped
   myofascial cuff to reduce the risk of postoperative CSF leaks. Methods:
   The medical records of 98 children were evaluated. They underwent
   foramen magnum decompression without dural closure using a T-shaped
   myofascial cuff whose incision lines run completely within the fascia
   and the muscles not extending beyond their attachment line to the bone.
   Results: There were 2 CSF leaks and no infections in 98 operated
   patients. The follow-up was between 4 and 48 months. Conclusions: The
   placement of a T-shaped myofascial cuff allows for watertight closure of
   the muscles and the fascia which is likely to reduce the rate of CSF
   leaks in pediatric Chiari I patients operated on without closure of the
   dura.

AB Introduction: Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS) is a technique
   that uses a device that allows the surgeon to insert a hand into the
   abdomen while maintaining the pneumoperitoneum. While there are a few
   reports of HALS in pediatric patients with benign diseases, there are no
   documented cases in pediatric oncology. Case presentation: A 13-year-old
   girl presented with the onset of left-sided abdominal pain. An abdominal
   ultrasound (US) revealed a mass in the left kidney. A magnetic resonance
   (MRI) of the abdomen and a total-body computerized tomography (CT) scan
   confirmed the presence of a 10cm left renal mass without evidence of
   metastatic lesions. Following the UMBRELLA SIOP-RTSG 2016 protocol, the
   patient underwent preoperative chemotherapy, after which a follow-up MRI
   showed a reduction in the mass size to 7 cm. We subsequently proceeded
   with a hand-assisted laparoscopic left nephrectomy. A GelPort (R)
   (Applied Medical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA, USA) was inserted through
   a 6-cm Pfannenstiel incision. Two additional 5-mm and 10-mm trocars were
   added in the left upper quadrant and the umbilicus. During the
   operation, a neoplastic infiltration was seen on the diaphragm, which
   had not been seen on MRI. A portion of the diaphragm was resected, and
   the defect was repaired using an interrupted resorbable suture. Eight
   lymph nodes were sampled from the hilar, supra-hiliar, infra-hiliar,
   paraaortic, and interaortocaval areas. Pathological examination
   confirmed a blastemal-predominant Wilms tumor, negative lymph nodes, and
   a positive diaphragmatic infiltrate. The postoperative course was
   uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the third postoperative
   day. She received the postoperative chemotherapy regimen indicated by
   the protocol. At a follow up of 41 months she has no recurrence.
   Conclusion: Hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery appears to be a safe and
   effective approach for the resection of solid renal tumors requiring
   total nephrectomy, potentially reducing the risk of tumor spillage and
   bleeding.

AB Background: Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) is characterized by excessive
   thoughts, emotions, and behaviors related to physical symptoms
   irrespective of their etiology. Estimates of SSD frequency assessed via
   self-report questionnaires range between 6.7% (general population) and
   53% (specialized setting). This study aims to examine the frequency of
   risk of SSD and associated factors in people with Major Medical
   Disorders (MMD) using cross-sectional data from the population-based
   Hamburg City Health Study. Methods: Risk of SSD was operationalized
   using the Somatic Symptom Scale-8, the Somatic Symptom Disorder-B
   Criteria Scale-12, and one item on symptom persistence. People at risk
   of SSD and not at risk were compared regarding biopsychosocial factors.
   Factors associated with risk of SSD were identified by hierarchical
   multiple logistic regression analysis. Results: N = 1944 people (mean
   age 64.8 +/- 8 years, 43.8% female) reported at least one MMD. Of those,
   6.8% [95%, CI 5.6-7.9%] were at risk of SSD and reported greater
   healthcare utilization and lower health-related quality of life.
   Logistic regression identified higher age (p=.032), lower education
   (p=.002), number of somatic comorbidities (p<.001), and elevated
   neuroticism (p<.001) and depression (p<.001) scores as factors
   associated with risk of SSD, with an explained variance of Nagelkerke R
   2 =0.45. Conclusion: The observed frequency of risk of SSD in people
   with MMD does not point towards an excessive symptom burden in this
   sample. However, those at risk experience significant psychosocial
   burdens and increased healthcare utilization, highlighting a vulnerable
   subgroup prone to SSD.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the systemic
   sequelae, as well as the dental and craniofacial development, of
   patients with rhabdomyosarcoma in relation to the treatment received and
   clinicalpathological variables. Materials and Methods: A retrospective
   cross-sectional study was performed. All individuals diagnosed with RMS
   between 1990 and 2022 were considered eligible. Cases who survived the
   primary tumor were included. Data were collected from medical records,
   and patients were called for clinical and radiographic examinations.
   Results: Thirty-eight patients were assessed, with a mean disease-free
   survival of 216.68 months ( 84.99). The primary location of the tumor
   was mainly the head and neck region (57.9 %). All patients received
   chemotherapy, and 30 (78.9 %) also underwent radiotherapy. The most
   frequently observed sequela was sensory impairment, which was
   significantly associated with tumors in the head and neck (p < 0.05), as
   well as with the use of radiotherapy (p = 0.034). Root formation failure
   was observed in 60% of cases, microdontia in 50%, and delayed tooth
   eruption in 40 %. A convex profile was predominant (80 %), along with
   maxillary (50 %) and mandibular (80%) retrusion and a skeletal class II
   diagnosis (60 %). Conclusions: Late systemic, dental, and craniofacial
   developmental sequelae are observed in pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma
   survivors, especially in patients who underwent radiotherapy in the head
   and neck region. Younger individuals at the time of treatment are at
   greater risk of late sequelae. (c) 2024 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

AB Fascioliasis is a globally distributed zoonotic parasitic disease that
   affects ruminants, including sheep. This study conducted from January to
   December 2023, aimed to determine the prevalence of Fasciola hepatica in
   sheep across three governorates in Egypt's Nile Delta and to assess
   associated risk factors. A total of 455 serum samples were analyzed
   using a commercial ELISA kit, revealing antibodies against F. hepatica
   in 22.2 % of the tested sheep. There was no significant association
   between locality or sex and the seroprevalence of F. hepatica in sheep;
   however, the highest prevalence was observed in Kafr ElSheikh and in
   female sheep. Concerning risk factors, poor conditioned sheep aged
   between 1 and 2 years showed 2.1 and 3.8 times higher of infection
   probability than others. In addition, the risk of F. hepatica infection
   in sheep increased significantly in winter season (OR = 6.6, 95 %CI:
   2.6-16.8), in absence of prophylactic treatment (OR = 2.2, 95 %CI:
   1.3-3.3) and in presence of snail (OR = 3, 95 %CI: 3-5.4). The existence
   of antibodies against F. hepatica in examined sheep raising in Nile
   Delta indicating that the disease is reported in the studied areas and
   needs to be managed on farms through control and preventative measures.

AB Radiochromic sensors, which enable express visualization of ionizing
   radiation by change in color or transparency, are ubiquitous in medical,
   scientific, and industrial applications. Most of the currently known
   radiochromic materials belong to organic compounds, while the potential
   of inorganic materials in terms of radiochromicity remains nearly
   unexplored. Here we report the measurements of dose sensitivity of
   radiochromic coloration intensity and decay kinetics of
   radiation-induced color centers for inorganic Ba-Sr fluoride borates
   with the compositions Ba-7(BO3)(3.5)F-3.5 and Ba3Sr4(BO3)(4)F-2.
   Experiments with irradiation of these polycrystalline materials using
   broadband synchrotron radiation (5-17 keV) revealed that the
   Ba3Sr4(BO3)(4)F-2 material has dose sensitivity of radiochromic
   coloration potentially suitable for measurements of doses from several
   cGy to similar to 10 Gy air kerma. The Ba-7(BO3)(3.5)F-3.5 material
   demonstrated a slightly lower dose sensitivity of radiochromic
   coloration than Ba3Sr4(BO3)(4)F-2, but also revealed the possibility of
   quick bleaching of the radiochromic coloration using intense visible
   light, which may be used in the development of reusable radiochromic
   sensors.

AB Estimating comparison functions is crucial in numerous domains, such as
   econometrics, clinical medicine, and public health, where evaluating the
   effectiveness of interventions or treatment effects is a central
   concern. While the response variables are much more expensive to collect
   than the covariates in many scenarios, to tackle the challenge of
   limited labeled data, we present a unified semi-supervised learning
   (SSL) framework to estimate comparison functions, like the difference
   between two independent samples in means, probabilities for events, the
   survival competition probability, by leveraging the information of
   unlabelled data with only covariate observations to improve estimation
   accuracy. Specifically, a class of efficient and adaptive estimators for
   comparison functions is proposed to effectively utilize both the labeled
   data and unlabelled data under the semi-supervised (SS) framework. We
   establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed
   estimators and provide the optimal weight yielding the most efficient
   estimator. Furthermore, the resulting estimator is shown to be
   semiparametric efficient if the working model is correctly specified.
   Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to confirm the consistency
   and efficiency of our proposed estimators. An application to a real data
   extracted from the 2001 Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) is also
   included.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and
   neurodegenerative disease characterized by neurofibrillary tangles
   (NFTs) and amyloid plaque. Familial AD is caused by mutations in the
   APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes and these mutations result in the early
   onset of the disease. Sporadic AD usually affects older adults over the
   age of 65 years and is, therefore classified as late-onset AD (LOAD).
   Several risk factors associated with LOAD including the APOE gene have
   been identified. Moreover, GWAS studies have identified a wide array of
   genes and polymorphisms that are associated with LOAD risk. Currently,
   the diagnosis of AD involves the evaluation of memory and personality
   changes, cognitive impairment, and medical and family history to rule
   out other diseases. Laboratory tests to assess the biomarkers in the
   body fluids as well as MRI, CT, and PET scans to analyze the presence of
   plaques and NFTs are also included in the diagnosis of AD. It is
   important to diagnose AD before the onset of clinical symptoms, i.e.
   during the preclinical stage, to delay the progression and for better
   management of the disease. Research has been conducted to identify
   biomarkers of AD in the CSF, serum, saliva, and urine during the
   preclinical stage. Current research has identified several biomarkers
   and potential biomarkers in the body fluids that enhance diagnostic
   accuracy. Aside from genetics, other factors such as diet, physical
   activity, and lifestyle factors may influence the risk of developing AD.
   Clinical trials are underway to find potential biomarkers, diagnostic
   measures, and treatments for AD mainly in the preclinical stage. This
   review provides an overview of the genes and biomarkers of AD.

AB Despite advancements in medicine and vaccination, the global death toll
   from dengue disease continues to rise, especially in developing
   countries, where modern healthcare access and prevention are limited. In
   the twenty-first century, dengue disease has emerged as a severe global
   challenge for the health sector because it severely affects more than
   100 countries and causes thousands of deaths annually. This study
   designs an SEIR-SEI mathematical model of the dengue virus by
   introducing a control parameter within the mosquito population. The
   inclusion of this parameter enables us to determine the impact of
   control measures on the transmission dynamics of the dengue virus.
   Firstly, we ensure that all state variables are bounded and remain
   non-negative throughout the study. Then, we calculate the two
   equilibrium points, the dengue-free equilibrium (DFE) and dengue-endemic
   equilibrium point (DEE), of the model for further analysis. We also
   calculate the reproductive number R, which is a crucial threshold
   parameter in epidemiology. The qualitative analysis shows that the model
   possesses local and global stability at the DFE and DEE points if R<1
   and R>1, respectively. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to
   identify the parameter with the most significant impact on the
   transmission dynamics of the dengue virus. This insight assists health
   policy makers in optimizing their struggles to lower the infection rates
   between susceptible humans and infected mosquito populations. We apply
   the two numerical schemes, the non-standard finite difference scheme
   (NSFD) and the Runga-kutta (RK4) scheme, to validate the theoretical and
   numerical results of the proposed SEIR-SEI dengue epidemic model.
   Numerical simulations are also provided in support of these results.

AB Background: Extensive burns are associated with a high mortality rate.
   Early prediction and action can reduce mortality. The National Early
   Warning Score (NEWS) is considered the best early warning score for
   predicting mortality. However, there has been no assessment conducted on
   the clinical prognostic significance of NEWS in individuals suffering
   from severe burns. The objective of this research was to establish a
   nomogram based on burn characteristics and the NEWS to predict survival
   in severely burned patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis was
   performed on 335 patients diagnosed with extensive burns from 2005 to
   2021 in the Department of Burn Surgery of Changhai Hospital, the First
   Affiliated Hospital of Naval Medical University. Univariate and
   multivariate analyses were used to determine independent prognostic
   factors. A nomogram was developed using these prognostic factors and its
   internal validity was assessed through bootstrap resampling. Results:
   The results of multivariate analysis showed that the independent factors
   affecting the prognosis of severe burn patients were age, full-thickness
   burn, creatinine, inhalation tracheotomy, and the NEWS, all of which
   were identified to create the nomogram. The Akaike Information Criterion
   and Bayesian Information Criterion values of the nomogram demonstrated
   superior goodness-of-fit in predicting severe burns compared to NEWS,
   with lower scores (195.21 vs. 201.24; 221.91 vs. 224.12, respectively).
   The bootstrap-adjusted concordance index (Cindex) of the nomogram
   yielded a higher value of 0.923(95 % CI 0.892-0.953), compared to NEWS
   which had a C-index of 0.699 (95 % CI 0.628-0.770). The calibration
   curves demonstrated excellent agreement between predicted probabilities
   and observed outcomes in the nomogram analysis. Furthermore, decision
   curve analysis indicated promising clinical utility for the proposed
   nomogram model. By applying an appropriate cutoff value derived from
   receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, it was observed that
   the high-risk group identified by the nomogram exhibited a significantly
   higher mortality rate than the low-risk group. Conclusion: This study
   introduces an innovative nomogram that predicts the survival rate of
   individuals with severe burn injuries by combining clinical attributes
   and laboratory examinations, demonstrating superior efficacy compared to
   conventional NEWS systems.

AB Our study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using lenvatinib

   the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system and US third-party
   payers. We estimated and compared the cost and effectiveness of the
   therapy with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab or everolimus with those of
   sunitinib therapy for treating advanced RCC. Background: Recently, due
   to its promising efficacy against advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC),
   the combination therapy with lenvatinib and pembrolizumab or everolimus
   has been approved as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced
   RCC in China and the United States. However, the high costs of
   combination therapies, especially of those new drugs, may limit their
   viability as clinical treatment options. Thus, our study aimed to
   evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab
   or everolimus as a first-line treatment for patients with advanced RCC
   from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system and US third-party
   payers. Methods: We established a Markov model using TreeAge Pro 2022
   software to estimate and compare the cost and effectiveness of the
   therapy with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab or everolimus with those of
   sunitinib therapy for treating advanced RCC based on the clinical data
   derived from a phase III randomized controlled trial (CLEAR,
   ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02811861). Transition probabilities and
   other data were calculated and obtained by using parametric survival
   modeling. The direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs),
   and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used as economic
   indicators in this analysis. The robustness of the model was assessed by
   performing one-way and probabilit y sensitivit y analyses (PSA).
   Results: Among the 3 treatment strategies, the sunitinib 1 was the least
   expensive option. All ICERs were far higher than the thresholds of
   $38,024 and $100,000 selected for China and the United States,
   respectively. The ICERs of the therapy with lenvatinib plus
   pembrolizumab versus sunitinib therapy were 106,749.06 US$/QALY and
   $414,672.19 US$/QALY in China and the United States, respectively. Thus,
   among these 2, the former strategy was less cost-effective than the
   latter. In addition, the ICERs of the lenvatinib plus everolimus
   treatment vs. sunitinib treatment were $44,353.18 US$/QALY and
   $292,653.10 US$/QALY in China and the United States, respectively. Thus,
   among these 2 strategies, the former was less cost-effective than the
   latter. The total cost of the lenvatinib plus everolimus treatment
   strategy was lower than that of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab; however,
   the former treatment was less effective than the latter. Conclusion: The
   treatment with lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab or everolimus is less
   cost-effective than the sunitinib treatment for patients with advanced
   RCC in China and the United States.

AB Background & aims: Meal timing is an emerging branch of science that
   investigates the influence of eating patterns on the circadian rhythm
   and overall health. There are still discrepancies in the literature as
   to whether late distribution of food intake and sleep disorders could
   impact biochemical, anthropometric, and cardiovascular markers. The
   objectives of this study were firstly observe skipping breakfast and
   sleep disorders over 12 months. Secondarily, analyze the individual
   influence of these findings on changes biochemical, anthropometric, and
   cardiovascular markers during the same period. Methods: This descriptive
   study is part of a tertiary analysis in a recently published study. This
   research recruited 84 participants with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) who were
   divided: Control-40 participants received only medical care;
   Intervention-44 participants received the same medical care along with
   nutritional assessment. Consultations occurred quarterly over 12th
   months, and a follow-up was conducted after 3 months. For influence
   analysis, non-normal variables were compared using Mann-Whitney, while
   normal variables were compared using unpaired t-tests. In all instances,
   a = 0.05 and P < 0.05 were adopted. Results: Analysis revealed a high
   percentage of patients in both groups who skipped breakfast, slept less
   than 6 h, and experienced nighttime awakenings during the 1st visit. By
   the 12th month, there was deterioration in all data in the control group
   and significant improvement in the intervention group. Those with sleep
   disturbances also had lower HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) values (p = 0.0054).
   For the other analyzes no significant differences were found.
   Conclusion: Participants who skipped breakfast and had more nocturnal
   awakenings possibly had worse glycemic and weight control, but this
   difference was not statistically significant and only trends were
   observed. Sleep disorders could affect HDL-C levels. However, the
   influence analysis does not establish a causal relationship and more
   clinical trials are needed to analyze this topic on T2D. (c) 2024

AB Accurate segmentation of medical images is of great significance for
   computer-aided diagnosis. Transformers show great promise in medical
   image segmentation, where they can complement local convolutions by
   capturing long-range dependencies via self-attention. Recent methods
   have shown good performance in dealing with variations in global context
   modeling. However, they do not deal well with problems such as boundary
   blurring because they ignore the edge prior and the complementarity of
   the global context. To address this challenge, we propose a segmentation
   network based on informative priors across scales. The encoder in our
   network utilizes the self-attention mechanism to capture long-range
   dependencies, while the proposed cross-scale prior decoder makes full
   use of the multi-scale features in the hierarchical vision transformer
   to capture boundary information by using a prior perceptron, and
   enhances both remote and local context information by suppressing
   background information using a pattern perceptron. Through the internal
   organic combination, the edge prior and the global background are fully
   used to complement each other, and the problem of inaccurate boundary
   segmentation is better solved. Extensive experiments have been conducted
   on multiple segmented datasets to validate the advanced performance of
   the model.

   highly effective in diagnosing and providing expedited treatment to
   these patients, they have recently begun to fall out of favor due to
   ethical concerns about their use. Today, over one-fourth of epilepsy
   monitoring units do not utilize PNEA provocation techniques in those
   suspected of the condition. Of the monitoring units that do, less than
   10% have an established protocol, and only 20% reported patient consent.
   The ethics and implications of the methods of diagnosing PNEA have been
   debated for decades. Specifically, the ethicality of attempting to
   provoke PNEA episodes using the proven effective methods of suggestion,
   nocebo, and other techniques have often left clinicians and medical
   ethicists offering opposing views. Here we review the personal and
   societal costs of PNEA, the efficacy of these provocation techniques,
   and the ethical considerations regarding their use, with specific
   emphasis on the importance of how these techniques are described to
   patients, as to both ensure informed consent and removed deception.
   Additionally, addressing these concerns, we propose ethical guidelines
   for the use of provocation techniques for the diagnosis of PNEA,
   concluding that such techniques can be ethically applied when certain
   conditions are met.

AB Objective: Reliable performance of medical devices is crucial for
   hospitals. However, these devices are increasingly connected with the
   internet and, thus, prone to cyberattacks resulting in risks for patient
   safety and financial loss. As the number of specialists in this field is
   limited in most hospitals, technology partnerships with medical
   technology manufacturers can be a suitable concept for increasing the
   level of security or limiting damage in the event of a cyberattack.
   Methods: Based on a discrete event simulation model (DES), the effects
   of security incidents with different degrees of impact on downtime
   costs, length of stay, staff utilization and lost arrivals in an
   emergency department of a general hospital were modelled and simulated.
   The effects of a technology partnership were simulated using what-if
   scenarios in order to be able to draw conclusions about the benefits by
   comparing the avoidable damage effects and the investment costs incurred
   for a technology partnership. Results: Depending on the scenario, the
   resulting savings range from <euro>245,579 to <euro>315,768, with a
   cost-benefit ratio between 4 and 5 over a 21-day period. Non-financial
   benefit (e.g. shorter lengths of stay or reduction IT resources) can
   also be achieved. Conclusion: Our analysis demonstrates that the level
   of security for hospitals and their medical devices as well as the
   operational functionality in the event of damage can be increased if
   such a concept it applied, i.e., patient safety can be increased while
   costs can be cut.

AB Healthcare data has become a powerful resource for generating insights
   that drive medical research. Association Rule Mining (ARM) techniques
   are widely used to identify relationships among diseases, treatments,
   and symptoms. However, sensitive information is often exposed, creating
   significant privacy challenges, particularly when data is integrated
   from multiple sources. Although Privacy-Preserving Association Rule
   Mining (PPARM) methods have been developed to address these issues, most
   rely on a single, predefined Minimum Support Threshold (MST) that is
   inflexible in adapting to diverse rule patterns. In this study, a
   Multi-Threshold Particle Swarm Optimization for Association Rule Mining
   (MPSO4ARM) model is introduced, integrating the Apriori and Particle
   Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms to perform data mining while
   protecting sensitive rules. A novel approach is employed by the proposed
   model to dynamically adjust the MST, allowing for more adaptive and
   effective privacy preservation. The MPSO4ARM model adjusts the MST
   on-the-fly based on rule length, improving its ability to safeguard
   sensitive data across various datasets. The proposed model was evaluated
   on the Chess, Mushroom, Retail, and Heart Disease datasets. The
   experimental results showed that the MPSO4ARM model outperforms
   traditional Apriori and conventional PSO algorithms, achieving higher
   fitness values and reducing side effects such as Hiding Failure (HF) and
   Missing Cost (MC), particularly in the Heart Disease and Mushroom
   datasets. Although the dynamic MST function introduces a moderate
   increase in computational runtime compared to Apriori and conventional
   PSO, this trade-off between execution time and enhanced privacy
   protection is considered acceptable, given the model's substantial
   improvements in data utility and rule sanitization.

AB Deep learning has demonstrated significant potential and advantages,
   achieving notable success in the medical field, particularly in the
   application of brain network analysis. However, most models ignore the
   uncertainty caused by inconsistent view quality and fail to effectively
   leverage the potential correlations and temporal sequences present in
   multi-view data, preventing neural networks from fully showcasing their
   strengths. To this end, this paper proposes dynamic evidence fusion
   neural networks (DEF-NNs) with uncertainty theory, and applies it to
   brain network analysis. Our model is established within a multi-view
   learning framework that considers the functional connections under each
   window as a view. We employ a dynamic evidence learning module to
   capture the evidence for each time window of the dynamic brain network,
   utilizing three distinct convolutional filters to extract feature maps.
   Then, a dynamic evidence fusion mechanism is designed and a dynamic
   trust function is constructed according to the temporal nature of dFC
   data. The evidence generated by multiple windows is fused at the
   decision level of classification, dealing with the uncertainty caused by
   inconsistent view quality and improving the classification performance.
   We verified the effectiveness of DEF-NNs through comparison with
   advanced algorithms on three schizophrenia datasets, and the results
   show that DEF-NNs significantly improved the classification performance
   of brain disease diagnosis tasks.

AB The interpretability of disease prediction models is often crucial for

   Existing methods in interpretable artificial intelligence improve model
   transparency but fall short in identifying precise, disease-specific

   algorithm called the data space landmark refiner was developed, which
   not only enhances both global interpretability and local
   interpretability but also reveals the intrinsic information of the data
   distribution. Using the proposed method, a type 2 diabetes mellitus
   diagnostic model with high interpretability was constructed on the basis
   of the electronic health records from two hospitals. Moreover, effective
   diagnostic information was directly derived from the model's internal
   parameters, demonstrating strong alignment with current clinical

   approaches, the proposed method offered more precise and specific

AB Fibrillar adhesive, as a novel biomimetic controllable adhesive, holds
   broad application prospects in the fields of medical devices, aerospace,
   and robotics. Evaluating the critical detachment force (pull-off force)
   of such materials, that is, establishing a pull-off force model, is one
   of the key issues to be addressed in the application process. The
   experimental results show that preload, dwell time, and retraction
   velocity are key factors affecting critical detachment force. However,
   there is no model that can take into account the influence of these
   three factors. In order to accurately evaluate the adhesion performance
   of fibrillar adhesive, this study took mushroom- shaped fibrillar
   adhesive (MFSA) as the object and carried out theoretical and
   experimental research on the modeling problem of its pull-off force.
   First, we derived a new pull-off force model based on the Gent & Schultz
   hypothesis and linear elastic fracture theory. In this model, the
   relative contact area is introduced to quantify the impact of preload
   and dwell time on the pull-off force, and the rate-dependent properties
   of the effective adhesion work are used to describe the impact of
   retraction velocity on the pull-off force. Then, the validity of the
   model is experimentally investigated. The experimental results show that
   this paper' s model can accurately predict the pull-off force of MFSA
   after parameter identification, thereby verifying the model's
   effectiveness. Finally, we used the pull-off force model to study the
   effects of model parameters on pull-off force.

AB The indication for treatment of viral hepatitis B and C depends on the
   degree of deterioration of liver function and secondarily viral load.
   APRI and MELD scores are WHO-validated tests for the assessment of liver
   fibrosis. They are inexpensive and non-invasive. Many patients suffer
   from viral hepatitis B or C in the Democratic Republic of Congo. These
   scores are an asset in the medical management of these patients. The
   objective of this study was to compare APRI and MELD scores in the
   prediction of fibrosis in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B in
   Lubumbashi. It included infected patients followed in the
   gastroenterology departments of the hospitals of Lubumbashi and the
   Center of Excellence and Expertise for Viral Hepatitis and other
   Pathologies (CEEHP). Biological parameters of patient samples were
   evaluated to calculate APRI and MELD scores. Analytical performance of
   APRI and MELD scores was evaluated by using liver biopsy as gold
   standard. The APRI and MELD scores had a sensitivity of 100 % and a
   specificity of 93.5 and 88.6 %, respectively. In the fibrosis group of
   patients infected with HBV, the mean APRI score was of 1.89 whereas the
   mean MELD score was of 12.4 Incorporating these scores in routine
   clinical practice could reduce the morbidity rate, the costs related to
   the practice of liver biopsy and thus improve the routine management of
   viral hepatitis in Lubumbashi.

   oxide (PEO) is a promising candidate for these devices due to its broad
   band gap, mechanical flexibility, chemical and thermal stability, water
   solubility, biocompatibility, and low cost. This study demonstrates a
   flexible transparent nonvolatile memory device utilizing a PEO and

   PET/ITO/PEO:PC61BM multilayer stack exceeds 86% in the optically visible
   range from 380 nm to 800 nm. The PET/ITO/PEO:PC61BM/Al device exhibits
   typical nonvolatile memory behavior, with the maximum electrical ON/OFF
   state ratio exceeding 103. Furthermore, retention tests for both ON and
   OFF states, along with bending cycle measurements and
   Write-Read-Erase-Read cycle endurance tests, indicate that the device
   remains stable under ambient conditions. The electrical conduction
   transition mechanisms are attributed to the formation of carbon
   filaments by PCBM aggregates.

AB Background: Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) allow the evaluation of
   safety levels in healthcare settings. Despite their use in various
   medical fields, a specific and comprehensive PSI catalogue for radiation
   oncology (RO) is lacking. The Patient Safety in German Radiation
   Oncology (PaSaGeRO) study aims for the development of a specific PSI
   catalogue in radiation oncology. Objectives: The primary objective of
   this systematic literature review as part of the PaSaGeRO study is to
   identify, formulate, and categorize PSIs specific to RO to bridge
   existing gaps in comprehensive patient safety evaluation. Methods: An
   electronic search in PubMed included studies from 1989 onwards, in
   English or German, focusing on safety and quality indicators in RO,
   patient safety measures, or risk analyses. Exclusions were
   non-transferable, country-specific measures, techniques exclusive to
   specific departments, and legally mandated procedures. Additional
   sources were identified through reference tracking and professional
   society websites. Two experts independently extracted PSIs from the
   included references. Results: Out of 157 included publications and nine
   secondary sources, we identified and formulated 145 PSIs. These were
   categorized into patient-specific processes (82, 56%), quality and risk
   management (42, 28%), human resources (15, 10%), and institutional
   culture (13, 9%). Conclusion: The hereby developed PSIs provides a base
   for professionals to systematically evaluate and improve safety
   practices, addressing previously unmet needs in this field. By offering
   clear guidance on safety assessment, the catalogue has the potential to
   drive significant improvements in patient care and safety outcomes in
   RO. Funded by Deutsche Krebshilfe. Registered in the German Clinical

   in Asian populations. We estimated the prevalence and incidence of
   narcolepsy and IH in Japan. Methods: The Japan Medical Data Center
   (JMDC) database includes healthcare claims data for employed individuals
   <= 74 years of age. Narcolepsy and IH cases were defined by >= 2
   diagnosis codes within 12 months, or a multiple sleep latency test with

   the database on December 31, 2019, 6,110,751 (86.4 %) had >= 12 months'
   continuous enrollment and were eligible for inclusion in the prevalence
   population. Age-sex standardized overall prevalences of narcolepsy and
   IH were 37.5 (95 % confidence intervals 35.9-39.1) and 7.7 (7.0-8.4) per
   100,000 persons, respectively. Prevalence for both conditions peaked at
   age 20-29 years and declined with increasing age. Age-sex standardized
   overall incidences of narcolepsy and IH were 5.1 (4.8-5.4) and 1.2
   (1.0-1.5) per 100,000 person-years, respectively. Narcolepsy and IH
   incidences peaked in the 10-19 and 20-29 years age groups then declined

AB The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) aggregates numerous smart medical
   devices and fully employs the collected health data to enhance patients'
   experiences. In IoMT, patients generate various encryption keys and
   receive keyword information sent by data requesters to securely share
   selected health data, which increases the potential risk of key leakage.
   Besides, the cloud server may tamper with search results. The existing
   schemes did not consider that patients may inadvertently disclose the
   keyword information of data requesters. Additionally, these schemes
   entail a significant cost for verifying the search results. To deal with
   these challenges, we innovatively propose a secure multi-key aggregation
   (SMKA) scheme with verifiable search for IoMT. Firstly, the SMKA scheme
   is built upon key-aggregate searchable encryption, utilizing an
   oblivious search request and blockchain technology to achieve secure key
   aggregation. Secondly, a dual verifiable algorithm is integrated into
   the scheme to provide lightweight verification for the search results.
   The proposed scheme can achieve access control, requester privacy,
   accountability, and dual verification while ensuring secure search.
   Furthermore, the security analysis and proof have shown the
   effectiveness of the proposed protocol in achieving the intended
   security goals. Finally, the performance analysis indicates the
   significant feasibility and scalability of the proposed scheme.

AB Objective: Infantile epileptic spasm syndrome (IESS) is a kind of
   developmental epileptic encephalopathy that can lead to severe outcomes,
   including drug-resistant epilepsy and impaired neurodevelopment. The
   underlying etiology, early diagnosis, and adequate treatment impact the
   outcome. Our study focused on examining the factors that influence the
   prognosis and the level of knowledge among families regarding IESS.
   Methods: In the Department of Pediatric Neurology at Gazi University
   Hospital, we examined 62 IESS children's demographics, neuroimaging,
   metabolic and genetic findings, seizure characteristics, treatment
   choices, and long-term outcomes. Our study examined family awareness of
   seizures, lead time to treatment (LTT), and their impact on prognosis.
   Results: Forty-two (67.8 %) patients presented with a symptomatic cause,
   with over half experiencing intraventricular hemorrhage and/or
   periventricular leukomalacia attributable to prematurity. The hormonal
   therapy (tetracosactide or oral prednisolone) was the preferred
   treatment. Treatment was effective for two-thirds of the patients.
   Nevertheless, hardly 50 % of the families acknowledged the "event" as a
   seizure. However, 34 (61 %) individuals had sought medical advice from a
   doctor during the first seven days. The mean time from the start of
   seizures to seeking medical care was 9.2 +/- 5.7 days. Conclusion: Our
   research revealed that the etiology was the most significant factor
   influencing the long-term outcomes of IESS. Additionally, we
   demonstrated that the clinicians who initially encountered the patients
   promptly referred them to pediatric neurology departments, despite the
   fact that the families' seizure awareness was poor. To help prevent this
   circumstance, it is important to provide information about infantile
   spasms to the families of high-risk infants.

   retrospective, monocentric, cohort study with a description of the local
   protocol, treatment results and tolerance profile. Design Classification
   III. Setting: Tertiary Referral center. Patients: All patients with CSP,
   confirmed by a reference ultrasound, without severity criteria requiring
   emergency surgery, between March 2015 to August 2022 were consecutively
   included. Interventions: All patients were treated by an Echo-guided
   trans-vaginal aspiration of the gestational sac followed by a local
   injection of Methotrexate 1 mg/kg under general anesthesia combined with
   Mifepristone and followed by an injection of 1 mg/kg within 2 days.
   Measurement and main finding: We included 35 patients with a mean hCG
   level of 28 872 UI/l +/- 38 063 UI/l and a mean gestational age of 6.8
   +/- 1.6 weeks of gestation. All patients were managed effectively with a
   good reduction in hCG serum levels. The mean duration of hCG
   negativation was 66 +/- 38 days after the start of management. Only one
   patient who had received the department's Methotrexate protocol required
   a second line of treatment. Among major complications, 2 patients
   experienced hemorrhagic shock which resolved without recourse to
   hemostasis hysterectomy. The success rate defined by the absence of
   recourse to secondary treatment was therefore 91.4 %. Among minor
   complications, the main complication was methotrexate-induced hepatic
   cytolysis in 7 patients (20 %). Nine women (26 %) required secondary
   hysteroscopic resection of trophoblastic retention. Twenty-one patients
   (60 %) had an ultrasound diagnosis of caesarean scar defect (CSD) after
   CSP management. Conclusion: The combination of transvaginal
   ultrasound-guided local MTX, Mifepristone and systemic MTX appears to be
   an effective treatment protocol for patients with CSP.

   Library, to evaluate racial and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular
   medicine. Results: A total of 1704 references were screened, of which 11
   articles were included in the final analysis. Applications of AI-based
   algorithms across different race/ ethnic groups were varied and involved
   diagnosis, prognosis, and imaging segmentation. Among the 11 studies, 9
   (82%) concluded that racial/ethnic bias existed, while 2 (18%) found no
   differences in the outcomes of AI models across various ethnicities.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest significant differences in how AI models
   perform in cardiovascular medicine across diverse racial and ethnic
   groups. Clinical relevance statement: The increasing integration of AI
   into cardiovascular medicine highlights the importance of evaluating its
   performance across diverse populations. This systematic review
   underscores the critical need to address racial and ethnic disparities
   in AI-based models to ensure equitable healthcare delivery.

AB Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials have attracted widespread attention
   due to their extremely low permittivity at plasma frequencies. In this
   work, carbon nanofibers encapsulating high-entropy alloy nanoparticles
   (HEA@CNFs) were prepared by electrospinning and three-dimensional (3D)
   printed into thin films with polydimethylsiloxane resin, achieving ENZ
   performance at 21 MHz when HEA@CNFs content reached 20 wt%. Theoretical
   calculations analyzed the mechanism of achieving radio frequency ENZ
   performance. When HEA was generated in CNFs, the delocalization ability
   of electrons around carbon atoms decreased, resulting in a decrease in
   carrier concentration. In addition, the non-parabolic enhancement and
   the increase in effective electron mass led to a decrease in plasma
   frequency. In addition to the ENZ response, the
   polydimethylsiloxane/HEA@CNFs ENZ film also exhibited biocompatibility
   and can be constructed into wearable electronic devices, realizing the
   detection of human body movements. It also has great application
   prospects in the fields of wearable medical devices and medical
   biological detection.

AB Background: Antimicrobial resistance caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa is
   a pressing global health issue impacting both hospitals and communities.
   Methodology: We analyzed demographic and susceptibility data from 1087
   samples, and tested them against five different antibiotics at the
   Institute of Medical Sciences & SUM Hospital. Eight machine learning
   algorithms (linear: multiple linear regression, generalized linear
   model-elastic net regularization, support vector machinelinear kernel,
   linear discriminant analysis; non-linear: support vector machine-radial
   basis function kernel, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, kernel
   k-nearest neighbors), were evaluated to develop the PerSceptoMed 1.0
   model for susceptibility prediction. Performance metrics such as
   accuracy, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, Hamming loss, 0/1 loss, and
   Receiver Operating Characteristic curves were computed. Statistical
   analysis was conducted to compare model performance. Results: Gender
   disparities were observed, with male patients showing higher infection
   rates, potentially due to occupational exposure, microbiome differences,
   comorbidities, and healthcare-seeking behaviors. age, clinical status,
   and antibiotic susceptibility were significant factors, complicating
   treatment strategies. Infections extended to outpatient departments,
   indicating a shift from hospital to community settings. Kernel k-nearest
   neighbors exhibited strong predictive capabilities, improving accuracy
   from 84.39% pre-balancing to 91.01% post-balancing, and an Area Under
   the Curve of 0.92. Statistical tests showed significant performance
   variations among models. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance
   of gender-sensitive approaches in infection management and the superior
   performance of nonlinear models in decoding complex data patterns.
   PerSceptoMed 1.0 demonstrates promise in enhancing antimicrobial
   resistance management by providing actionable insights based on
   demographic data.

AB The ongoing challenge of infectious pathogens highlights the need for
   accurate and accessible methods to discern their genetic signatures,
   especially in resource-limited settings. In response to this crucial
   requirement, we introduce an affordable large-scale screening platform
   for infectious pathogen detection, using Hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a
   fundamental model. This proposed biosensor integrates an exonuclease
   III-assisted target recycling amplification strategy within a
   high-throughput 96-well microplate format. The HBV DNA target binds to a
   capture probe DNA and exonuclease III digests the probe to release the
   target. This mechanism enables the target to engage in binding cycles
   with new probes, each digested in turn, increasing detection sensitivity
   for even small quantities of HBV DNA. The implemented approach
   incorporates a biotin-streptavidin interaction allowing the undigested
   capture probe DNA to bind to a 5 '-biotin-modified detection probe for
   effective HBV DNA quantification. This interaction generates a signal
   that, following the enzyme-substrate reaction, can be detected on-site
   using a smartphone, offering either optical or electrochemical readouts.
   The developed biosensor was capable of detecting HBV DNA with a
   detection limit of 5.62 fM and provided a considerable linear range
   covering concentrations from 100 fM to 100 nM. The determination of HBV
   DNA quantities in spiked human serum was achieved with a recovery of
   90.0 % - 107.4 % as well. The results suggest that the developed
   dual-mode biosensor offers an adaptable and cost-effective approach for
   detecting infectious diseases, with promising applications in medical
   diagnostics and environmental monitoring to support public health
   efforts.

AB Objectives: An inadequate intake of calcium in pregnancy is associated
   with higher risks of maternal hypertensive pregnancy disorders,
   premature birth and intrauterine growth restriction. An evidence based
   and clinically applicable tool to efficiently estimate the adequacy of
   calcium intake in pregnant women currently does not exist. The aim of
   this study is to develop an effective and simple digital screening tool
   for calcium intake in pregnancy. Study Design: We extracted all data
   from the Rotterdam Periconceptional cohort (PREDICT study) conducted at
   the Erasmus MC, University Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,
   between November 2014 and December 2020. Data was extracted from food
   frequency questionnaires. The estimated average requirement of 750 m/day
   was defined as the lower limit for an adequate calcium intake. We
   created a prediction model, using multivariable binary logistic
   regression with backward stepwise selection, predicting the probability
   of adequate calcium intake. We developed a simple screening tool based
   on the prediction model. Results: 694 participants are included, of
   which 201 (29 %) had an adequate calcium intake. Total daily or weekly
   intakes of cheese, milk, and yogurt or curd were selected as predictors
   for the prediction model. The model had excellent discrimination (AUC
   0.858), a good fit (Brier score 0.136, HL statistic p = 0.499) and
   satisfactory calibration. The test accuracy measures were: sensitivity
   80.9 %, specificity 77.1 %, PPV 89.7 %, NPV 62.2 %. A colour coded
   digital screening tool was developed for use in clinical practice.
   Conclusions: This evidence-based and simple screening tool is a reliable
   and efficient instrument to predict inadequate calcium intakes in
   pregnancy, which can easily be incorporated in daily clinical practice
   and existing pregnancy coaching platforms.

   pandemic's impact on TRPI incidence. Design: Secondary analysis of
   Global Tracheostomy Collaborative database and a multi-center hospital
   system's electronic medical records. Setting: 27 hospitals, primarily in
   the United States, United Kingdom, and Australasia. Patients: 6,400
   adults and 2,405 pediatric patients hospitalized with tracheostomy
   between 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2021. Measurement: TRPI as a
   binary outcome, reported as odds ratios. Results: TRPI incidence was
   4.69 % in adults and 5.65 % in children. For adults, associated risks
   were female sex (OR: 0.64), severe obesity (OR: 2.62), ICU admission
   (OR: 2.05), cuffed tracheostomy (OR: 1.49), fenestrated tracheostomy
   (OR: 15.37), percutaneous insertion (OR: 2.03) and COVID-19 infection
   (OR: 1.66). For children, associated risks were diabetes mellitus (OR:
   4.31) and ICU admission (OR: 2.68). TRPI odds increased rapidly in the
   first 60 days of stay. Age was positively associated with TRPI in adults
   (OR: 1.014) and children (OR: 1.060). Black patients had higher TRPI
   incidence than white patients; no moderating effects of race were found.
   Hospital cluster effects (adults ICC: 0.227; children ICC: 0.138)
   indicated unmeasured hospital-level factors played a significant role.
   Conclusions: Increasing age and length of stay up to 60 days are TRPI
   risk factors. Other risks for adults were female sex, severe obesity,
   cuffed/fenestrated tracheostomy, percutaneous insertion, and COVID-19;
   for children, diabetes mellitus and FlexTend devices were risks.
   Admission during the COVID-19 pandemic had contrasting effects for
   adults and children. Additional research is needed on unmeasured
   hospital-level factors. Implications for Clinical Practice: These
   findings can guide targeted interventions to reduce TRPI incidence and
   inform tracheostomy care during public health crises. Hospital
   benchmarking of tracheostomy-related pressure injuries is needed.

   prevent the adverse consequences of malnutrition. However, nutritional
   risk screening is often disregarded in hospitals. Purpose: To evaluate
   the agreement of nutritional risk screening results between screening
   performed by emergency medical services (EMS) and at the hospital ward.
   Methods: The EMS used the Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) to
   screen the nutritional risk of community-dwelling patients aged >= 70
   years transported to the emergency department of a large Finnish
   hospital. The NRS-2002 results from the EMS were compared to results
   obtained during hospitalization. Results: The EMS screened 472 patients
   and recognized nutritional risk in 81 (17 %). NRS-2002 was repeated at
   hospital ward in 97 of the screened. In about two-thirds of the cases
   (69 %), the EMS and ward personnel agreed on whether the patient had
   nutritional risk or not, and one-third of patients (31/97, 32 %) had the
   exact same score. The EMS tended to give lower scores (mean difference
   0.70 +/- 1.29, p < 0.001). Twenty-four patients considered not to be at
   nutritional risk according to the EMS were recognized as risk patients
   at the ward. Conclusion: Nutritional risk screening by the EMS could
   help in identifying persons requiring more detailed assessment of
   nutritional status.

AB Background: Penetrating skull base injuries are complex clinical
   scenarios requiring multidisciplinary management to address both
   immediate life-threatening conditions and long-term complications.
   Anterior skull base fractures account for 21% of skull fractures from
   which 4% were caused by head trauma [1]. Post-traumatic cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF) leaks may arise, becoming a major source of morbidity; these
   can lead to the development of severe intracranial infections [2].
   Endoscopic Endonasal Approach is a conservative technique that uses a
   multilayer coverage including a nasoseptal flap to create durable
   reconstruction [3]. We describe our experience using this technique to
   repair a wide anterior skull defect after extraction of a foreign body.
   Case description: A 46-year-old male experienced a traumatic CSF leak
   following a penetrating head injury from a fall at a construction site,
   where a steel bar penetrated from the left temporo-mandibular juntction
   through the sphenoid sinuses to the right eye socket. Initial brain
   involvement was minimal, and the injury was isolated to the head.
   Conclusion: This case highlights the complexities of managing
   penetrating brain injuries. Prior to deciding the extraction of the
   foreign body and subsequent endoscopic repair of the skull base, the
   multidisciplinary team relied on imaging for a secure removal.
   Maintaining airway, stabilizing the patient, and executing skilled
   surgical intervention were key to successfully manage the case.
   Postoperative treatment was crucial, including monitoring for
   complications such as diabetes insipidus and ensuring the closure of the
   CSF leak through endoscopic techniques. The integration of fluorescein
   in CSF during surgery allowed us to localize leaks effectively. This
   case highlights the importance of a well-coordinated medical response to
   assess patient management in severe traumatic scenarios. Lessons learned
   from such cases contribute significantly to the evolving field of trauma
   surgery, emphasizing the need for a structured approach to both acute
   and postoperative care.

   through cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and
   amperometry, with different weight ratios of ZnO and rGO (3:1, 1:1, and
   1:3). The results show that the ZnO/rGO (1:1) nanocomposite modified
   electrode exhibits remarkable sensitivity (850.15 mu A(-1) mM(-1)
   cm(-2)), a low limit of detection (0.07 mu M), excellent selectivity,
   and long-term stability for urea detection. Developed sensor leverages
   the advantages of electrochemical sensing, including simplicity, rapid
   response, high sensitivity, and good selectivity, making it a promising
   solution for environmental monitoring and medical diagnostics.

AB Deep learning shows promise for medical image segmentation but suffers
   performance declines when applied to diverse healthcare sites due to
   data discrepancies among the different sites. Translating deep learning
   models to new clinical environments is challenging, especially when the
   original source data used for training is unavailable due to privacy
   restrictions. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt models
   to new unlabeled target domains without requiring access to the original
   source data. However, existing SFDA methods face challenges such as
   error propagation, misalignment of visual and structural features, and
   inability to preserve source knowledge. This paper introduces Continual
   Learning Multi-Scale domain adaptation (CLMS), an end-toend SFDA
   framework integrating multi-scale reconstruction, continual learning,
   and style alignment to bridge domain gaps across medical sites using
   only unlabeled target data or publicly available data. Compared to the
   current state-of-the-art methods, CLMS consistently and significantly
   achieved top performance for different tasks, including prostate MRI
   segmentation (improved Dice of 10.87 %), colonoscopy polyp segmentation
   (improved Dice of 17.73 %), and plus disease classification from retinal
   images (improved AUC of 11.19 %). Crucially, CLMS preserved source
   knowledge for all the tasks, avoiding catastrophic forgetting. CLMS
   demonstrates a promising solution for translating deep learning models
   to new clinical imaging domains towards safe, reliable deployment across
   diverse healthcare settings.

AB Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) aims to adapt a pretrained model to
   new classes with as few as a single labeled training sample per class.
   Despite the prototype based approaches have achieved substantial
   success, existing models are limited to the imaging scenarios with
   considerably distinct objects and not highly complex background, e.g.,
   natural images. This makes such models suboptimal for medical imaging
   with both conditions invalid. To address this problem, we propose a
   novel D etail S elf-refined P rototype Net work ( DSPNet ) to construct
   high-fidelity prototypes representing the object foreground and the
   background more comprehensively. Specifically, to construct global
   semantics while maintaining the captured detail semantics, we learn the
   foreground prototypes by modeling the multimodal structures with
   clustering and then fusing each in a channel-wise manner. Considering
   that the background often has no apparent semantic relation in the
   spatial dimensions, we integrate channel-specific structural information
   under sparse channel-aware regulation. Extensive experiments on three
   challenging medical image benchmarks show the superiority of DSPNet over
   previous state-of-the-art methods. The code and data are available at
   https://github.com/tntek/DSPNet.

AB Multivariate time series classification (MTSC), which identifies
   categories of multiple sensor signals recorded in continuous time, is
   widely used in various fields such as transportation, finance, and
   medical treatment. The focused challenge remains learning the
   dependencies between subsequences to capture discriminative patterns
   while providing convincing explanations. In this paper, we propose a
   temporal-variable parallel deep learning framework to mine global and
   local features to achieve a win-win situation in performance and
   interpretability. Specifically, for harmonizing the inattention
   blindness of global features, we introduce a graph attention mechanism
   with global awareness (GAT-g), where the learning of edge
   representations incorporates both inter-node relationships and the
   node-to-graph context. Furthermore, for evaluating the feature
   combinations utility, we exploit game interactions for the first time,
   which quantifies the utility of feature combination through Shapley
   values to illustrate the dynamically coordinating representation ability
   of the model for diverse time series features. In addition, the
   interpretation module leverages temporal and variable subspace attention
   distributions to provide instantiated explanations with additive
   computational complexity, enhancing the comprehension of prediction
   results. Experimental evaluation on the University of East Anglia (UEA)
   archive of 30 multivariate time series datasets shows that the proposed
   method outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets.

AB The PALLAS-reactor is an advanced nuclear reactor designed for producing
   medical isotopes and for carrying out research on (medical) nuclear
   technology. RELAP5 is the primary tool for modeling the accident
   scenarios relevant to the licensing of this reactor. The Groeneveld
   Look-Up Tables (LUT) are the default model of RELAP5 for estimating
   Critical Heat Flux (CHF). Literature has shown that the LUT over-predict
   CHF inside narrow, rectangular channels such as the cooling channels of
   the core of the PALLAS-reactor. Empirical correlations such as that of
   Sudo-Kaminaga or its modified version by Kim et al. (SK-Kim) are better
   suited for these geometries. However, these correlations are typically
   implemented in one-dimensional (1D) System Thermal-Hydraulics codes
   whereby the quantities of interest are averaged-out over the control
   domains. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) could capture
   three-dimensional effects that could help reducing unnecessary
   conservatism embedded in some 1D approaches (e.g. Sudo-Kaminaga or
   SK-Kim correlations). Therefore, CFD is to be employed to support the
   Deterministic Safety Analyses of the PALLAS-reactor if there are
   scenarios in which the SK-Kim correlation predicts CHF. Boiling flows
   inside round or annular vertical channels have been extensively modeled
   with CFD. However, attempts at modeling CHF in narrow, rectangular
   geometries are still scarce. Therefore, this work aims at developing and
   validating a CFD approach for predicting CHF in rectangular channels.
   Four combinations of turbulence interaction and turbulent dispersion
   models are investigated; the results are compared against experiments
   and the SK-Kim correlation; sensitivity analyses are conducted on the
   turbulence models as well as the mesh. Certain combinations of
   turbulence interaction and turbulent dispersion models promote the
   transport of steam towards the center of the channel, thus increasing
   CHF, while other cause the steam to remain confined at the wall, thereby
   lowering the CHF. This study provides several CFD options to estimate
   CHF depending on the required level of conservatism. Estimating CHF in a
   conservative manner is crucial for licensing the PALLAS-reactor and
   other reactors of similar design, thereby securing the production of
   medical isotopes in Europe and the rest of the world.

AB Study objectives: The comorbidity of insomnia and obstructive sleep
   apnea (COMISA) is common and associated with adverse clinical
   consequences. While insomnia is often underdiagnosed among individuals
   with OSA, the identification of insomnia among these individuals may
   lead to improved medical care. Our objective was to assess the
   performance of two simplified tools (insomnia severity index-2 (ISI-2)
   and ISI-3) to identify insomnia among individuals with OSA. We
   hypothesized that the ISI-2 and ISI-3 perform well to diagnose insomnia
   among individuals with OSA. Methods: Four different cohorts of
   individuals with sleep disorders were studied. Cohorts 1,2 and 3
   included individuals with OSA. Cohort 4 included individuals with
   insomnia only. The performance of ISI-2 and ISI-3 was compared to
   ISI-7-based diagnosis of insomnia using receiving operating
   characteristic curve analysis. Results: Cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4 included
   490, 124, 39 and 118 individuals, respectively. Individuals from cohorts
   1, 2 and 3 were middle-aged, obese and had severe OSA on average.
   Individuals from cohort 2 were predominantly male while from cohorts 3
   and 4 were predominantly female. Individuals from cohort 4 were slightly
   younger, and eutrophic on average. Cohorts 3 and 4 had higher insomnia
   severity (ISI-7) than cohorts 1 and 2. Using cohort 1, the best cut-offs
   for ISI-2 and ISI-3 were >= 6 and >= 8, respectively. Area under the
   curve (AUC) for ISI-2 was .900, .951 and .893 among cohorts 1, 2 and 4,
   respectively. AUC for ISI-3 was .924, .961 and .936 among cohorts 1, 2
   and 4, respectively. Conclusion: ISI-2 and ISI-3 are accurate screening
   tools for insomnia among individuals with sleep disorders. Easy
   recognition of insomnia among individuals with COMISA may improve
   clinical outcomes.

AB In reliability engineering or medical studies, more information about

   inference when the lifetime of a product or material has the power
   failure rate distribution is developed. To save the cost and time
   induced by units the experiment is designed with respect to partially
   step-stress accelerated life tests (ALTs) with type-I generalized hybrid
   censoring scheme (GHCS). The point estimate of the model parameters as
   well as the accelerated factor are obtained with respect to the maximum
   likelihood (ML) and Bayes methods. Also, the asymptotic normal
   properties of ML estimates, two bootstrap techniques and Markov Chain
   Monte Carlo techniques are used to formulate interval estimators. A real
   lifetime data set is used to illustrate the application of the proposed
   model. Finally, a Monte Carlo simulation study is constructed to discuss
   and assess, the proposed model and estimation methods.

AB Background: Combat casualty care has advanced significantly with the
   implementation of evidence-based protocols designed to lower
   combat-related mortality. Over the last decade, two major urban
   conflicts in southern Israel have challenged the evolving military
   trauma system. This study aimed to assess differences in prehospital
   care and compare the outcomes of aeromedically evacuated casualties from
   the 2014 and 2023 conflicts. Methods: This retrospective registry-based
   cohort study utilized records from the Military Airborne Combat
   Evacuation Unit (MACEU) and the Israeli National Trauma Registry.
   Eligible patients evacuated by MACEU between 07.17.14 and 08.16.14 and
   between 10.27.23 and 03.17.24 were compared. Groundevacuated casualties
   were excluded. Demographics, prehospital interventions, and clinical
   outcomes were compared. Results: During the 2014 conflict, 251 patients
   were evacuated alive, compared to 940 in 2023. Both conflicts involved
   mostly young males injured by explosions, with comparable injury
   distributions across body regions. The time from injury to hospital
   arrival decreased from 65 min (IQR 47-94) in 2014 to 60 min (IQR 47-180)
   in 2023 (d = 0.5, p < 0.001). The proportion of severely injured
   patients (ISS >= 16) increased from 18.3 % to 25.2 % (OR 1.5 [95 % CI
   1.06-2.14], p = 0.03), and critically injured patients (ISS >= 25) from
   7.6 % to 12.8 % (OR 1.79 [95 % CI 1.08-2.96], p = 0.03). Prehospital
   advanced airway interventions and tube thoracostomies decreased from
   11.6 % to 6.0 % (OR 0.48 [95 % CI 0.30-0.76], p < 0.001) and from 7.0 %
   to 2.1 % (OR 0.28 [95 % CI 0.15-0.54], p < 0.001), respectively.
   Prehospital blood transfusions use increased from 6.6 % to 16.4 % (OR
   2.78 [95 % CI 1.64-4.76], p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality rates
   remained stable (2.7 % vs. 2.5 %, OR 1.12 [95 % CI 0.44-2.81], p =
   0.99). Although not statistically significant, lower mortality rates
   were recorded among the severely (13.0 % vs. 8.4 %, OR 0.61 [95 % CI
   0.23-1.61, p = 0.48) and critically injured (26.3 % vs. 15.8 %, OR 0.53
   [95 % CI 0.17 -1.64], p = 0.32). Conclusion: Over the past decade, there
   has been a decline in prehospital airway interventions and
   thoracostomies, coupled with an increase in early blood transfusions.
   Despite greater injury severity, mortality rates have remained stable.
   Although not statistically significant, lower mortality rates were
   recorded among the severely and critically injured. These findings
   support the "less is more" approach in modern pre hospital combat
   casualty care .

   which slows the dissemination of research and can influence the academic
   progress of authors. This study evaluated the publication times for
   articles in radiology journals, in particular the relationship between

   data was obtained from Journal Citation Reports to conduct a comparative
   analysis of radiology journals against those in other disciplines of
   clinical medicine using highest IF, median IF, cited halflife, immediacy
   index, and number of journals. Journals from various radiology
   subcategories were further examined to assess IF trends over time. The
   Pearson correlation coefficient was used to identify any statistically
   significant relationships between IF and other variables. Results: Among
   28 medical disciplines, there was a significant positive correlation of
   0.63 between the number of journals and the highest journal IF of a
   given discipline. Among 135 radiology journals categorized into 12
   subcategories, there was a similar significant correlation of 0.64. For
   high-ranking radiology journals, the median time from submission to
   publication online was 22.7 weeks [IQR = 9.3] and median time from
   submission to publication in print was 37.9 weeks [IQR = 7.1]. The
   former time interval showed a positive correlation of 0.58 with journal
   IF at p < 0.05. Conclusion: There is wide variation in the time from
   submission to publication in radiology journals. Authors can expect a
   longer turnaround time when publishing in higher-impact journals.

AB Background and objective: Chest radiography is a medical imaging
   technique widely used to diagnose thoracic diseases. However, X-ray
   images may contain artifacts such as irrelevant objects, medical
   devices, wires and electrodes that can introduce unnecessary noise,
   making difficult the distinction of relevant anatomical structures, and
   hindering accurate diagnoses. We aim in this study to address the issue
   of these artifacts in order to improve lung diseases classification
   results. Methods: In this paper we present a novel preprocessing
   approach which begins by detecting images that contain artifacts and
   then we reduce the artifacts' noise effect by generating sharper images
   using a CycleGAN model. The DenseNet-121 model, used for the
   classification, incorporates channel and spatial attention mechanisms to
   specifically focus on relevant parts of the image. Additional
   information contained in the dataset, namely clinical characteristics,
   were also integrated into the model. Results: We evaluated the
   performance of the classification model before and after applying our
   proposed artifact preprocessing approach. These results clearly
   demonstrate that our preprocessing approach significantly improves the
   model's AUC by 5.91% for pneumonia and 6.44% for consolidation
   classification, outperforming previous studies for the 14 diseases in
   the ChestX-Ray14 dataset. Conclusion: This research highlights the
   importance of considering the presence of artifacts when diagnosing lung
   diseases from radiographic images. By eliminating unwanted noise, our
   approach enables models to focus on relevant diagnostic features,
   thereby improving their performance. The results demonstrated that our
   approach is promising, highlighting its potential for broader
   applications in lung disease classification.

   (EMR-LIP) framework, a lightweight approach for optimizing the
   preprocessing of longitudinal, irregular EMR data, aiming to enhance
   research efficiency, consistency, reproducibility, and comparability.
   Materials and Methods: EMR-LIP modularizes the preprocessing of
   longitudinal irregular EMR data, offering tools with a low level of
   encapsulation. Compared to other pipelines, EMR-LIP categorizes
   variables in a more granular manner, designing specific preprocessing
   techniques for each type. To demonstrate its versatility, EMR-LIP was
   applied in an empirical study to two public EMR databases, MIMIC-IV and
   eICU-CRD. Data processed with EMRLIP was then used to test several
   renowned deep learning models on a range of commonly used benchmark
   tasks. Results: In both the MIMIC-IV and eICU-CRD databases, models
   based on EMR-LIP showed superior baseline performance compared to
   previous studies. Interestingly, using data preprocessed by EMR-LIP,
   traditional models such as LSTM and GRU outperformed more complex
   models, achieving an AUROC of up to 0.94 for inhospital death
   prediction. Additionally, models based on EMR-LIP showed stable
   performance across various resampling intervals and exhibited better
   fairness in performance across different ethnic groups. Conclusion:
   EMR-LIP streamlines the preprocessing of irregular longitudinal EMR
   data, offering an end-to-end solution for model-ready data creation, and
   has been open-sourced for collaborative refinement by the research
   community.

AB As a critical component of computer-aided diagnosis systems, medical
   image segmentation plays a vital role in assisting clinicians in making
   rapid and accurate decisions and formulating treatment plans.
   Nevertheless, precise medical image segmentation still presents a number
   of challenges, including insufficient feature extraction capabilities in
   the presence of limited sample sizes, blurred segmentation boundaries,
   and information loss between the encoder and decoder. In order to
   address these issues, we propose a Multi-Scale BoundaryAware Aggregation
   Network with Bidirectional Information Exchange and Feature Refinement
   (MBF-Net) for medical image segmentation. Initially, we design a
   Multi-Scale Boundary-Aware Aggregation Encoder (MBAE) that aggregates
   features from different scales and pixel levels within the input images,
   capturing fine-grained boundary information in deep features and
   establishing comprehensive global and local multi-scale contextual
   dependencies. This design significantly enhances the model's
   understanding of the overall image structure and its ability to discern
   subtle differences between lesions and background. Subsequently, a
   Multi-Scale Bidirectional Information Transmission (MBIT) module is
   introduced, which integrates bidirectional information flow between
   low-level and high-level features, enabling multi-scale features to flow
   bidirectionally across different layers. The MBIT module effectively
   preserves crucial boundary details during cross-layer information
   transmission, thereby bridging the semantic gap between the encoder and
   decoder, and thereby improving the clarity of the segmentation
   boundaries. Finally, we develop a Feature Refinement and Aggregation
   Fusion (FRAF) module, designed to integrate feature information from
   various semantic levels, which alleviates discrepancies between features
   at varying scales, thus enhancing the segmentation accuracy of the
   network. The generalisation and effectiveness of MBF-Net are validated
   through comprehensive experiments on a range of tasks, including nuclear
   segmentation, breast cancer segmentation, polyp segmentation and skin
   lesion segmentation. Both subjective and objective evaluations
   demonstrate that MBF-Net significantly outperforms current
   state-of-the-art methods, achieving average Dice Similarity Coefficient
   (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 86.34 % and 78.37 %,
   respectively. The superior performance of MBF-Net in terms of
   segmentation accuracy and quality is demonstrated across five public
   datasets.

AB Introduction: Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a significant global health
   challenge that results in profound physical and neurological
   impairments. Despite progress in medical care, the treatment options for
   SCI are still restricted and often focus on symptom management rather
   than promoting neural repair and functional recovery. This study focused
   on clarifying the impact of Schwann cell (SC) transplantation on the
   molecular, cellular, and functional basis of recovery in animal models
   of SCI. Material and methods: Relevant studies were identified by
   conducting searches across multiple databases, which included PubMed,
   Web of Science, Scopus, and ProQuest. The data were analyzed via
   comprehensive meta- analysis software. We assessed the risk of bias via
   the SYRCLE method. Results: The analysis included 59 studies, 48 of
   which provided quantitative data. The results revealed significant
   improvements in various outcome variables, including protein zero

AB Nano compounds such as nanocomposites and developing due to their unique
   capabilities and numerous properties. These compounds have many
   properties and have a special place in the field of medical sciences.
   Therefore, synthesizing and reporting new nanocompounds with biological
   properties is essential and valuable. A novel nanocomposite containing
   Iridium and 1,3,5-benzene-tri-4-carboxyphenyl (Iridium-BTB MOF) was
   synthesized. Biological properties of newly synthesized nanocomposites,
   such as antioxidant activity (against DPPH), antimicrobial activity
   (against fungal strains, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative
   bacteria), and anticancer activity (against skin cancer cells and breast
   cancer cells), were evaluated and reported. Using FT-IR, XRD, XPS, EDAX,
   and EDAX mapping, the proposed structure of synthesized nanocomposite
   was confirmed. Other structural features of the synthesized
   nanocomposite were characterized using SEM, TEM, BET, and TGA. Being
   nano-sized (91 nm), having a desirable specific surface area (52.36
   m2/g), BJH volume pore (0.49 cm3/g), and high thermal stability (350
   degrees C) gave it the ability to have potent biological activity and
   the best MIC, MFC, MBC, and IZD on the studied species were observed as
   2 mu g/mL (against Staphylococcus aureus), 128 mu g/mL (against
   Aspergillus fumigatus), 4 mu g/mL (against Staphylococcus aureus), and
   22 mm (against Staphylococcus aureus), respectively, which were higher
   than some commercial drugs. In anticancer activity studies, the IC50
   values were 29.72 mu g/mL against skin cancer cells and 33.53 mu g/mL
   against breast cancer cells, respectively. The obtained results
   demonstrated that the synthesized nanocomposite exhibited strong
   activity against various disease-causing agents, including microbial,
   cancer, and oxidant agents, and can be considered a strong bioactive
   candidate.

AB Introduction: Patient safety has become a central research theme in
   emergency medical services (EMS). The population age structure is
   changing in high-income countries, potentially causing increases in the
   need for EMS. As the number of EMS missions is growing, the safety of
   non-conveyance has become the topic of wide discussion. Managing adverse
   events is part of quality management and safety improvement. This study
   aimed to examine the incidence, reasons, and process of complaints
   related to EMS. Methods: A retrospective mixed methods study was
   conducted on EMS-related complaints that were evaluated by Regional
   State Administrative Agency during 2013-2019. The data was classified
   according to conveyance and authority's decision, and finally analysed
   thematically. Results: The data included 73 complaints, 39 of which were
   included in the study. There were more complaints related to
   non-conveyance than conveyance. The authority provided administrative
   guidance in approximately half of the cases in both groups. One of the
   most common event types in both groups was related to ethical competence
   and conduct. Conclusions: The number of complaints was very low. A
   considerable portion of the complaints related to paramedics' behavior
   and patient treatment. Respecting and actively listening to patients may
   further decrease these complaints. No administrative caveats to
   paramedics were observed in our data.

AB Background: Over the last few decades: heart disease (HD) has emerged as
   one of the deadliest diseases in the world. Approximately more than 31 %
   of the population dies from HD each year. The Diagnosis of HD in an
   earlier stage is a cognitively challenging task due to the vast and
   complex availability of medical datasets. Many tests are available for
   the diagnosis of HD, such as ECG, etc.; but the proper diagnosis of the
   disease is still a great challenge. Methods: Motivated by existing
   challenges and the significance of HD, the authors developed a novel
   hybrid XGBoost Classifier framework for HD prediction that incorporates
   outlier removal and optimized hyperparameter tuning. In this approach,
   outliers were handled using z-score and interquartile range (IQR)
   methods, and hyperparameters were optimized using the "Optuna"
   framework. Additionally, the impact of different traintest ratios
   (70,30, 80:20, and 90:10) on model performance was evaluated using
   Cleveland HD dataset, both with and without outliers. Results: The
   proposed hybrid model achieved the finest performance metrics without
   outliers on a 90:10 train-test ratio with an accuracy of 95.45 %,
   sensitivity of 92.86 %, precision of 100 %, specificity of 100 %,
   f1-score 96.3 %, training time 0.8 x 10_16 s and testing time 0.1 x
   10_17 s. It was validated by Stratify K-Fold CrossValidation.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of data preprocessing,
   appropriate train-test ratios, and hyperparameter optimization in HD
   prediction. The proposed framework provides a promising solution for
   accurate and efficient HD diagnosis, offering potential benefits for
   cardiac patient healthcare and decision-making.

AB Tungsten-rhenium (W-Re) alloys are extensively used in medical devices,
   electronics, industrial equipment, aerospace, and nuclear energy sectors
   due to their low ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT),
   excellent high-temperature creep resistance, and superior properties
   related to recrystallization, ablation, and irradiation at elevated
   temperatures. However, with the advancement of technologies in these
   critical fields, the performance demands on W-Re alloys are continually
   increasing. As a result, optimizing the fabrication processes of WRe
   alloys to enhance their performance under ultra-high temperature
   conditions has become essential. This review provides a detailed
   overview of the ultra-high temperature applications of W-Re alloys, the
   effects of Re alloying on their performance, various strengthening
   methods and mechanisms, and fabrication techniques. By analyzing the
   strengthening mechanisms, we identify that advancements in powder
   preparation, bulk densification, and deformation processing are key to
   improving the stable performance of W-Re alloys under extreme
   temperatures. Additionally, we address several challenges related to the
   fabrication methods and propose solutions. We hope that this
   comprehensive review will support researchers in developing W-Re alloys
   with enhanced performance while addressing the production and

AB Background: Dysphagia is a swallowing impairment with adverse health
   consequences. The impact of preoperative dysphagia on postoperative
   outcomes is not known. This study will examine the association between
   preoperative dysphagia and postoperative outcomes. Methods: This is a
   retrospective, observational study of patients >= 50 years of age
   undergoing surgery not directly involving the swallowing mechanism
   (i.e., oral cavity, larynx, pharynx, or esophagus). The National COVID
   Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database from January 1st, 2020 to August
   31st, 2023 was used. The N3C database comprises electronic health record
   (EHR) data from more than 75 US health systems and harmonizes these data
   in a centralized resource. The main predictor was dysphagia with or
   without malnutrition in the 3 months prior to surgery. Logistic
   regression models assessed the association between our main predictor
   and outcomes of mortality, readmission, and medical/surgical
   complications adjusted for covariates. A negative binomial regression
   model was used for length of stay (LOS). Results: 380,869 adults >50
   years old were included, mean age 66.0 (SD = 9.2), 52.6 % male. 7.9 %
   had dysphagia and/or malnutrition 3 months preoperatively including 3.0
   % preoperative dysphagia alone, 3.8 % preoperative malnutrition alone,
   and 1.1 % both. Adjusted models demonstrated higher odds of mortality
   (1-year mortality odds ratio (OR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI)
   1.29 to 1.44), readmission (90-day readmission OR 1.19,95% CI 1.14 to
   1.24), and medical/surgical complications (OR 1.35,95% CI 1.28 to 1.42)
   among patients with 3 months preoperative dysphagia with or without
   malnutrition compared to patients with neither condition. Conclusion:
   Patients with 3 months preoperative dysphagia with and without
   malnutrition had poor postoperative outcomes. These findings highlight
   the rationale for integrating dysphagia screening and intervention into
   routine preoperative protocols to mitigate the risk of adverse
   postoperative outcomes.

   antibiotic treatments. This review explores the novel potential of
   piezocatalysts as antimicrobial agents, offering an innovative approach
   to mitigating AMR. Piezocatalytic materials, capable of generating
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) under mechanical stress, present a
   promising method to counteract pathogenic bacteria. Mechanistic insights
   into the actions of piezocatalysts such as cell wall and membrane
   disruption, biofilm degradation, induction of bacterial stress
   responses, and interference with cellular functions are analyzed to
   highlight their targeted antimicrobial effects. Furthermore, the diverse
   applicability of piezocatalysts across medical, environmental, and water
   purification systems is explored, underscoring their relevance in
   contexts requiring sustained antimicrobial action. In addition to these
   roles, piezocatalysts hold potential in energy harvesting, sensing
   technologies, catalytic reactors, and biomedical engineering.
   Piezocatalysts thus emerge as promising contributors to advanced,
   antibiotic-free strategies, promoting sustainable antimicrobial
   practices within both academic research and industrial applications.

AB Background and Objectives The neurologic examination is a key part of
   neurologist visits. The neurologic examination leads to more accurate
   diagnoses, avoidance of unnecessary tests and procedures, and a stronger
   doctor-patient relationship. However, the neurologic examination takes
   time to perform, leading to longer visits with neurologists than with
   other specialists. We hypothesize that the neurologic examination adds
   quantifiable time to patient visits to a neurologist. Methods We
   examined a 5-year cross-section of the National Ambulatory Medical Care
   Survey, 2012-2016, selecting visits to a neurologist. We extracted an
   indicator for neurologic examination, time spent with the patient in
   minutes, patient demographics, new or established visit, reasons for
   visit, new vs chronic problems, insurance status, geographic region,
   collection year, and survey design variables. We report descriptive
   statistics among patient visits with and without neurologic examinations
   and built a generalized linear model of visit time and neurologic
   examination with patient and visit information as covariates and
   interaction terms between neurologic examination and new/established
   visits. A subgroup analysis was conducted by reasons for visit. All
   analyses incorporated survey design variables for accurate standard
   errors. Results There were 4,009 patient visits among 211 neurologists,
   comprising 11.3 million annual visits in the weighted sample. Neurologic
   examination was reported in 58%, with no difference in demographics,
   geographic regions, or reasons for visit between those who did or did
   not receive a neurologic examination. The mean time spent with the
   patient in visits with a neurologic examination was 29.9 minutes,
   compared with 25.0 minutes without (p = 0.002). In the adjusted model,
   new visits with a neurologic examination were associated with 4.1
   minutes greater time spent with the patient (95% CI + 0.6 minutes, +7.7
   minutes, p = 0.02) and established visits with a neurologic examination
   were 4.6 minutes longer (95% CI + 1.5 minutes, +7.5 minutes, p = 0.006.)
   In subgroup analysis, association of neurologic examination with time
   spent with the patient was greatest for visits for pain (+6.7 minutes,
   95% CI + 0.7 minutes, +12.9 minutes, p = 0.03) and known neurologic
   diagnoses (+7.5 minutes, 95% CI + 4.2 minutes, +10.7 minutes, p <
   0.001). Discussion This study demonstrates the association of neurologic
   examinations with increased time spent with the patient in ambulatory
   care. Further work is needed to assess the effects on medical decision
   making, costs of care, and patient access to neurologists.

AB We are writing in response to the recent publication on the use of
   artificial intelligence, particularly ChatGPT, in generating educational
   materials for pediatric kidney transplant patients (Patient Education

   caregivers, adolescents, and children facing complex medical
   procedures[1]. As researchers working at the intersection of healthcare
   and technology, we would like to offer further reflections on the
   study's findings, providing both constructive feedback and innovative
   solutions for advancing the use of AI in this field. One of the most
   compelling aspects of the study is the potential for ChatGPT to
   revolutionize patient education by significantly reducing the time and

   demonstrated that even a free version of ChatGPT allows healthcare
   providers to rapidly generate materials, which is particularly
   advantageous for overstretched healthcare systems. Additionally, the
   study highlights ChatGPT's ability to bridge communication gaps in
   resource-limited settings by providing patients and families with
   accessible, personalized information about transplant procedures. We
   strongly support the idea that AI-driven education can democratize
   access to essential health information, especially in regions where
   medical expertise is limited. Furthermore, AI's real-time response
   capabilities could enable healthcare providers to offer more interactive
   and tailored education, empowering patients to make informed decisions

AB Background: Building rapport with young patients is crucial for
   fostering a sense of comfort that enhances their cooperation during
   clinical encounters and improves clinical outcomes. The available data
   on children with neurodevelopmental disabilities in community-based
   settings, including data on child-physician rapport, is limited. Aims:
   To examine how children with neurodevelopmental disabilities perceive
   rapport with treating physicians compared to parents and treating
   physicians and to evaluate the relationship between the child-reported
   rapport and its impact on their cooperation. Methods: One hundred two
   children with neurodevelopmental disabilities (M years = 9.63, SD =
   2.42) completed the CHARM-C Questionnaire, which assessed their
   experience of rapport with their examining physicians following
   neurodevelopmental assessments. In parallel, their parents and
   physicians completed the CHARM-A Questionnaire, which assessed how they
   perceived the children's experience of rapport (a total of 306
   questionnaires). The physicians also rated children's cooperation. The
   data were analyzed using correlation, regression, and mixed linear
   analyses. Results: Children's perceptions of rapport were significantly
   less positive than those of parents (d = -0.60) and physicians (d =
   -0.45). A moderate partial correlation (r = .37) was found between
   children's and parents' perceptions. Neither children's nor parents'
   perceptions were correlated with physicians' perceptions. Children's
   perceptions of rapport were positively associated with greater
   cooperation (beta = .28). Discussion: Children with neurodevelopmental
   disabilities rated their rapport with physicians lower than parents and
   doctors. Their evaluations offer valuable insights, complementing
   caregivers' and professionals' perspectives. Training physicians to
   improve their assessments of children's needs during medical encounters
   is critically important.

AB Panoramic X-rays are crucial in dental radiology, providing detailed
   images that are essential for diagnosing and planning treatment for
   various oral conditions. The advent of automated methods that learn from
   annotated data promises to significantly aid clinical experts in making
   accurate diagnoses. However, these methods often require large amounts
   of annotated data, making the generation of high-quality annotations for
   panoramic X-rays both challenging and time-consuming. This paper
   introduces a novel bilateral symmetry- based augmentation method
   specifically designed to enhance tooth segmentation in panoramic X-rays.
   By exploiting the inherent bilateral symmetry of these images, our
   proposed method systematically generates augmented data, leading to
   substantial improvements in the performance of tooth segmentation
   models. By increasing the training data size fourfold, our approach
   proportionately reduces the effort required to manually annotate
   extensive datasets. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging
   the symmetrical properties of medical images to enhance model
   performance and accuracy in dental radiology. The effectiveness of the
   proposed method is evaluated on three widely adopted deep learning
   models: U-Net, SE U-Net, and TransUNet. Significant improvements in
   segmentation accuracy are observed with the proposed augmentation method
   across all models. For example, the average Dice Similarity Coefficient
   (DSC) increases by over 8%, reaching 76.7% for TransUNet. Further,
   comparisons with existing augmentation methods, including rigid
   transform- based and elastic grid-based techniques, show that the
   proposed method consistently outperforms them with additional
   improvements up to 5% in terms of average DSC, with the exact
   improvement varying depending on the model and training dataset size. We
   have made the data augmentation codes and tools developed based on our
   method available at

AB Osteoid Osteoma (OO) is a common primary bone tumor that often presents
   with night pain in younger orthopedic patients. Although typically
   extra-articular, intra-articular presentations may be difficult to
   diagnose. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent
   detailed imaging of the articular surface, it has been reported to lead
   to occasional misdiagnosis given limitations in spatial resolution,
   particularly for smaller lesions. Computed tomography (CT) remains the
   gold standard imaging modality for OO. The treatment for osteoid osteoma
   consists of medical management, minimally invasive image guided
   techniques, and surgical resection in order of most conservative to most
   aggressive. We present the case of a 31-year-old male with persistent
   posterolateral knee pain after subchondroplasty. CT demonstrated an OO
   in the posterior tibial plateau. The patient was successfully treated
   with CT-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation with complete
   resolution of symptoms. We also provide a brief literature review of the
   diagnosis and treatment of OO to help heighten the awareness of this
   sometimes inconspicuous diagnosis.

AB Background: Post-9/11 veterans were exposed to environmental and
   occupational pollutants during deployment.
   Objective: Our aim was to determine associations between
   deployment-related exposures and sinusitis and rhinitis.
   Methods: Between April 2018 and March 2020, veterans with land-based
   deployment after 9/11 who were living within 25 miles of 6 Department of
   Veteran Affairs medical centers were randomly chosen by using a Defense
   Manpower Data Center roster. Participants completed
   interviewer-administered questionnaires, which included a 32-item
   deployment exposure battery and self-report of rhinitis and health
   professional-diagnosed sinusitis. Exposure categories included burn pit
   smoke, combustion engine exhaust/ground dust, other open combustion
   sources, toxicants, and military job-related VGDF. Each item was scored
   on the basis of frequency and duration of exposure; ordinal scores were
   summed and scaled to 100 within each category. Odds ratios (ORs) were
   estimated using logistic regression for sinusitis and rhinitis
   separately. ORs were scaled per 20-point exposure score.
   Results: Among the 1960 participants, the incidences of sinusitis and
   rhinitis with onset during deployment were 2.1% and 3.6%, respectively;
   the incidences of postdeployment onset were 5.1% and 5.6%, respectively.
   Toxicant exposure consisted mainly of "applying pesticide, insecticide,
   or repellent to your own skin or to your own clothing" and was
   associated with rhinitis with onset during deployment (OR= 1.50 [95% CI=
   1.31-1.84]) and onset after deployment (OR= 1.21 [95% CI= 0.93-1.50]).
   There were no associations with burn pit smoke or other exposure
   categories.
   Conclusion: Veterans with deployment exposures to toxicants were at
   increased risk of rhinitis, particularly during deployment. The clinical
   evaluation of postdeployment veterans should address rhinitis as a
   deployment-related condition.

AB This study addresses the critical challenges faced in cancer care,
   particularly in predicting survival times for patients with lung cancer
   and acute myeloid leukemia. Despite recent advancements in medical
   science, existing models often fall short in accurately capturing
   disease progression, leading to less effective clinical decision-
   making, and compromised patient outcomes. The need for advanced
   predictive models is urgent to improve survival time forecasts and
   enhance treatment strategies. In response to this, we introduce a novel
   probabilistic approach, the New Weibull (NEWE) model, which is part of a
   newly generated class designed to model cancer patient data more
   effectively. Our methodology includes using seven well-known estimation
   methods, each rigorously evaluated for consistency through Monte Carlo
   simulation studies focused on key metrics such as absolute bias, mean
   square error, and mean relative error. The datasets analyzed include
   survival times for twenty acute myeloid leukemia patients, 121 breast
   cancer patients from 1929 to 1938, 33 patients with acute myelogenous
   leukemia, data from eighteen individuals who died from causes unrelated
   to cancer, and survival times of advanced lung cancer patients
   undergoing standard chemotherapy. The NEWE model outperformed competing
   models, particularly in Anderson-Darling, Cramer-von Mises, and
   Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, with significantly higher p-values. These
   findings highlight the NEWE model's potential to transform predictive
   oncology by offering more precise survival time predictions, improving
   the quality of care and decision-making in cancer treatment.

AB Background: Crystalloid administration during early resuscitation of
   bleeding trauma patients is recommended by current guidelines, yet
   evidence supporting this practice is limited. We aimed to evaluate the
   trends in the utilization of crystalloids during the last decade and to
   determine the threshold crystalloid volume independently associated with
   mortality risk in trauma patients at risk of or experiencing shock.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study using data from the Israel
   National Trauma Registry (January 2013 to December 2022) was conducted.
   We included patients >= 16-years-old transported by emergency medical
   services from the injury scene and subsequently hospitalized. Inclusion
   criteria included systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg and/or shock index
   >1 in the field or emergency department (ED). Patients transferred
   between facilities, those who received prehospital blood products, or
   those who suffered burns were excluded. The primary outcome was
   all-cause in-hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was
   performed to investigate the association between the total volume of
   crystalloid administered during prehospital and ED treatment and the
   primary outcome, adjusting for clinical variables. Results: Among 10,707
   eligible patients, the median age was 39.0 years (IQR 25.0-65.0), 63.5 %
   were male, and 81.4 % suffered from blunt trauma, mainly caused by motor
   vehicle collisions. There was a trend toward reduced crystalloid use
   over the study period both prehospital and in the ED. Crystalloid
   volumes >= 2 liters were independently associated with increased
   mortality with an aOR of 1.47 (95 % CI 1.09-1.96, p = 0.01) for
   2000-2499 ml and an aOR of 1.49 (95 % CI 1.08-2.04, p = 0.01) for >=
   2500 ml. Older age, male gender, lower blood pressure, and severe injury
   (ISS >15) were also independently associated with higher mortality.
   Conclusion: The administration of >= 2 liters of crystalloids during the
   initial phase of care was independently associated with increased
   mortality in hemodynamically compromised trauma patients. These findings
   support the judicious and goal-directed use of crystalloids in the
   resuscitation of trauma patients. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights are

AB The escalating global incidence of allergy patients illustrates the
   growing impact of allergic issues on global health. Allergens are small
   molecule antigens that trigger allergic reactions. A widely recognized
   strategy for allergy prevention involves identifying allergens and
   avoiding re-exposure. However, the laboratory methods to identify
   allergenic proteins are often time-consuming and resource-intensive.
   There is a crucial need to establish efficient and reliable
   computational approaches for the identification of allergenic proteins.
   In this study, we developed a novel allergenic proteins predictor named
   Alg-MFDL, which integrates pre-trained protein language models (PLMs)
   and traditional handcrafted features to achieve a more complete protein
   representation. First, we compared the performance of eight pre-trained
   PLMs from ProtTrans and ESM-2 and selected the bestperforming one from
   each of the two groups. In addition, we evaluated the performance of
   three handcrafted features and different combinations of them to select
   the optimal feature or feature combination. Then, these three protein
   representations were fused and used as inputs to train the convolutional
   neural network (CNN). Finally, the independent validation was performed
   on benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of AlgMFDL. As a
   result, Alg-MFDL achieved an accuracy of 0.973, a precision of 0.996, a
   sensitivity of 0.951, and an F1 value of 0.973, outperforming the most
   of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all key metrics. We
   anticipated that the proposed model could be considered a useful tool
   for predicting allergen proteins.

AB Bulk Metallic Glasses (BMGs) are becoming prevalent as specialty
   components in aerospace, energy, and medical technologies, and hold
   long-term potential as consumer good components. When manufacturing BMG
   components by solidification and thermoplastic forming, however, even
   small deviations from optimal processing conditions can alter the
   structural glass state, promote crystallization, and introduce geometric
   flaws. Established techniques to evaluate the integrity of BMG
   components are often expensive, time-consuming, and destructive in
   nature. In this study, we employ Resonance Ultrasound Spectroscopy (RUS)
   as an inexpensive, fast, and nondestructive alternative to accurately
   measure the elastic properties of BMG components and thus estimate their
   fictive temperature. Further, RUS can detect crystallinity and geometric
   flaws. These capabilities are demonstrated even for complex component
   geometries, based on a BMG planet gear here.

AB White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) has emerged as a significant viral
   pathogen in shrimp aquaculture since it was first identified in 1992.
   Similar to most crustacean pathogens, cannibalism is the most crucial
   mechanism for the horizontal transmission of WSSV. While several studies
   have reported the impact of cannibalism on WSSV transmission, a
   comprehensive investigation that reflects varying conditions has not yet
   been conducted. Herein, we investigated the impact of cannibalism on
   WSSV transmission in whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) from the
   perspective of a relative risk assessment. In Experiment 1,
   cannibalistic behaviors of healthy whiteleg shrimp were monitored at
   three different stocking densities. The number of cannibalism incidents
   increased threefold at higher densities, whereas the odds ratios were
   not significantly different. In Experiment 2, WSSV infection and
   mortality were observed in shrimp administered high-severity (G2-G3)
   tissues (1 to 20% biomass inoculum), whereas shrimp administered
   low-severity (G0-G1) tissues were not infected with WSSV, regardless of
   the amount of inoculum. However, shrimp administered high-severity
   (G2-G3) tissue showed a 3.47-fold increase in hazard as biomass
   increased from 1 to 20%. Experiment 3 compared feeding challenge tests
   at 30 degrees C and 25 degrees C. When shrimp were administered 10%
   biomass of high-severity (G2-G3) tissue, the hazard ratio increased
   3.88-fold at 25 degrees C compared with 30 degrees C. This study found a
   direct correlation between WSSV severity grade, prevalence, water
   temperature, and transmission through the cannibalism route. These
   findings provide insights into WSSV transmission via cannibalism and
   clarify that proper carcass removal measures can directly aid in
   inhibiting white spot disease progression.

AB Ageing is an inevitable and multifaceted biological process that impacts
   a wide range of cellular and molecular mechanisms, leading to the
   development of various diseases, such as liver fibrosis. Liver fibrosis
   progresses to cirrhosis, which is an advanced form due to high amounts
   of extracellular matrix and restoration of normal liver structure with
   failure to repair damaged tissue and cells, marking the end of liver
   function and total liver failure, ultimately death. The most important
   factors are reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cellular senescence.
   Oxidative stress is defined as an impairment by ROS, which are
   by-products of the mitochondrial electron transport chain and other key
   molecular pathways that induce cell damage and can activate cellular
   senescence pathways. Cellular senescence is characterized by
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and proteases secreted by
   senescent cells, collectively known as the senescence-associated
   secretory phenotype (SASP). The presence of senescent cells, which
   disrupt tissue architecture and function and increase senescent cell
   production in liver tissues, contributes to fibrogenesis. Hepatic
   stellate cells (HSCs) are activated in response to chronic liver injury,
   oxidative stress, and senescence signals that drive excessive production
   and deposition of extracellular matrix. This review article aims to
   provide a comprehensive overview of the pathogenic role of ROS and
   cellular senescence in the aging liver and their contribution to
   fibrosis.

   It is recommended that clinicians finish the administration of BFLUID
   within 6 h; however, this recommendation currently lacks supporting
   empirical evidence. Accordingly, the present study aimed to investigate
   the risk of B. cereus infection associated with BFLUID infusion
   according to the administration time. In the present single-center
   retrospective observational cohort study, clinical information was
   extracted from the medical records of patients aged ≥18 years who
   received BFLUID infusions via a peripheral line between April 2017 and
   October 2020 at Saitama Red Cross Hospital (Saitama, Japan). A total of
   96 patients were enrolled during the study period, of whom 32 developed
   B. cereus infection. No patients with BFLUID infusions administered
   within 6 h developed B. cereus infection. Compared with patients who
   received BFLUID infusions within 8 h, those who received BFLUID
   infusions after 8 h had a 7-fold higher risk of infection. The present
   study provided empirical evidence supporting the recommendation that
   amino acid infusions should be administered to patients within 6 h to
   minimize the risk of B. cereus infection.

AB Poor osseointegration markedly compromises the longevity of prostheses.
   To enhance the stability of titanium implants, surface functionalization
   is a proven strategy to promote prosthesis-bone integration. This study
   developed a hydrogel coating capable of simultaneous osteoangiogenesis
   and vascularization by incorporating deferoxamine (DFO) into a sodium
   alginate mineralized collagen composite hydrogel. The physicochemical
   properties of this hydrogel were thoroughly analyzed. In vivo and in
   vitro experiments confirmed the hydrogel scaffold's osteogenic and
   angiogenic capabilities. Results indicated that sodium alginate notably
   enhanced the mechanical characteristics of the mineralized collagen,
   allowing it to fully infiltrate the interstices of the 3Dprinted
   titanium scaffold. Furthermore, as the hydrogel degraded, collagen,
   calcium ion, phosphate ion, and DFO were gradually released around the
   scaffolds, altering the local osteogenic microenvironment and strongly
   inducing new bone tissue growth. These findings offer novel perspectives
   for the creation and utilization of functionalized bone implant
   materials.

AB Introduction: Glycemic control is a major concern during critical
   illness. Several prospective studies have yielded conflicting results
   regarding its mortality effect. Current recommendations are to initiate
   insulin therapy for all patients when glucose levels are higher than 180
   mg/dL. Some suggest decreasing this threshold for non-diabetic patients
   to 140 mg/dL. These thresholds haven't been compared to each other or to
   other glucose thresholds. This study aimed to find out whether different
   glucose levels are associated with 90-d mortality. Methods: A
   retrospective cohort study. Critically ill patients who were admitted
   from 2019 to 2022 to a mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit for
   more than 48 h were included. Collected data included baseline
   characteristics, and all glucose levels recorded (time-indexed to the
   admission time). Glucose levels were considered constant until the
   following glucose level. The percentage of time above several chosen
   glucose cutoff levels was calculated and analyzed for mortality adjusted
   to other baseline covariates. Results: 45,512 glucose measurements of
   1429 patients were included in the study; 21.76 % of the patients had
   diabetes. Mean glucose level and glucose variability were higher in
   diabetic patients (165.86 mg/dL vs 135.47 mg/dL, p <0.0001, and 30.81 %
   vs 20.86%, p <0.0001, respectively), along with a higher incidence of
   hypoglycemia (40.84 % vs 24.89 %, p < 0.001). 90-d mortality was higher
   in diabetic patietns (42.12 % vs 32.41 %, p = 0.0014) and was found
   associated with age, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation 2
   score, medical or surgical admission reasons. Percentage of time above
   cutoffs >= 150 mg/dL was associated with 90-d mortality only in
   non-diabetic patients. Conclusions: In non-diabetic patients,
   hyperglycemia greater than 150 mg/dL, was associated with increased
   90-day mortality. (c) 2024 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and

AB Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized computer
   vision, demonstrating remarkable performance in various tasks. However,
   their end-to-end learning strategy poses challenges to explainability.
   In this work, we explore the application of explainability techniques in
   brain tumor segmentation using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data.
   Our adaptive learning class activation map (AL-CAM) employs a unique
   multiple-pop-out training strategy and contrastive learning to enhance
   internal outputs, improving interpretability. Additionally, we introduce
   a novel approach to explainability in graph convolutional neural
   networks (GCNNs). The usage of traditional CNN interpretability tools
   such as saliency maps, CAM, and EB are often unable to handle the
   complexity of graph-structured data. Our work brim this gap by adapting
   and improving these techniques for graph convolutional neural networks
   (GCNN). We present two innovative tools: adaptive CAM for differentiated
   interpretability and contrastive EB for deeper insights into functions.
   Using a novel feature fusion approach, we further push the boundaries
   and combine the feature strengths of GNN and CNN for a holistic
   understanding of GCNN decision-making. Our proposed framework enables
   interpretability in various areas, not just medical imaging. Our work
   demonstrates the versatility of explainability methods and demonstrates
   their power in unlocking the secrets of GCNNs and ultimately solving
   real-world challenges, particularly in the field of medical image
   analysis.

AB Depression is associated with premature mortality, but evidence is
   mainly derived from Western countries. Very limited research has
   evaluated shortened lifespan in depression using life-years-lost (LYLs),
   a recently developed mortality metric taking into account the illness
   onset for life expectancy estimation. Temporal trends of differential
   mortality gap are understudied. This population-based cohort study,
   which utilized a territory-wide medical-record database of public
   inpatient and outpatient healthcare services in Hong Kong, evaluated the
   extent of premature mortality in 126,573 individuals with depression
   (persons-years=1,139,073) between January 2002 and December 2021
   regarding the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) and excess LYLs. Trends
   in annual SMRs over 20 years were assessed by joinpoint analyses. The
   results showed that individuals with depression exhibited significantly
   higher all-cause (SMR=1.84 [95% CI=1.82-1.88]), natural-cause (1.69
   [1.66-1.72]), and unnatural-cause (5.24 [4.97-5.51]) mortality rates
   than the general population. Suicidespecific SMR was markedly elevated
   (7.92 [7.47-8.38]), particularly in the 15-34 year-olds (12.75
   [10.87-14.79]). Respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases and
   cancers accounted for the majority of deaths. Excess LYLs extended to
   men (5.67 years, 95% CI = 5.45-5.90) and women (4.06 years, 95% CI =
   3.89-4.23). Overall and natural-cause mortality rates improved over
   time, but unnatural-cause and suicide-related mortality gaps persisted.
   Taken together, this study indicates that depression is associated with
   increased premature mortality and reduced lifespan in a predominantly
   Chinese population, mainly attributed to natural causes. Relative
   suicide-specific mortality is substantially elevated, especially among
   young people. The pronounced mortality gap underscores an urgent need
   for effective interventions targeting improved physical health and
   suicide risk reduction in individuals with depression.

AB To ensure the aroma and flavour quality of dried herbs, it is essential
   to understand flavour reactions that occur during complex drying
   mechanisms. This study investigated aroma formation in dried Dendrobium
   nobile stems (Shihu), valued in Chinese cuisine and traditional
   medicine. Stems were dried in a convection oven over 48 h (70 degrees
   C). Carotenoids, amino acids, monosaccharides, and the resultant
   volatile compounds were quantified using HPLC-DAD, LC-MS/MS, HPAEC-PAD
   and GC-MS, respectively. beta-ionone, 4-oxoisophorone and
   dihydroactinidiolide were formed through carotenoid degradation
   (supported by the concomitant loss of the precursor beta-carotene).
   Safranal and beta-damascenone were formed only through thermal drying.
   Methional and 3methylbutanal were formed through Strecker degradation as
   part of the Maillard reaction, flavour precursors methionine and
   leucine, in addition to glucose, levels also reduced. This study
   provides quantified evidence revealing the mechanisms of flavour
   formation in Shihu during the drying process. This offers scientific
   strategies to enhance the flavour quality of other comparable food
   ingredients.

AB Causal effect estimation is a critical task in statistical learning that
   aims to find the causal effect on subjects by identifying causal links
   between a number of predictor (or, explanatory) variables and the
   outcome of a treatment. In a regressional framework, we assign a
   treatment and outcome model to estimate the average causal effect.
   Additionally, for high dimensional regression problems, variable
   selection methods are also used to find a subset of predictor variables
   that maximises the predictive performance of the underlying model for
   better estimation of the causal effect. In this paper, we propose a
   different approach. We focus on the variable selection aspects of high
   dimensional causal estimation problem. We suggest a cautious Bayesian
   group LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) framework
   for variable selection using prior sensitivity analysis. We argue that
   in some cases, abstaining from selecting (or, rejecting) a predictor is
   beneficial and we should gather more information to obtain a more
   decisive result. We also show that for problems with very limited
   information, expert elicited variable selection can give us a more
   stable causal effect estimation as it avoids overfitting. Lastly, we
   carry a comparative study with synthetic dataset and show the
   applicability of our method in real-life situations.

AB Objective: This study aimed to examine the potential of experiencing
   aesthetic chills to enhance reward learning in individuals with elevated
   depressive symptoms, specifically anhedonia, by investigating the effect
   of chills on participants' ability to modulate behavior as a function of
   rewards. Methods: A total of 103 participants with elevated depressive
   symptoms took part in the experiment. Among them, 59 participants had
   depressive symptoms (BDI >= 20), with 26 classified as "High Anhedonic"
   (HA) and 33 as "Low Anhedonic" (LA). Additionally, 39 participants
   without elevated depressive symptoms (BDI < 20 and SHAPs <32) were
   included as the control group. We utilized ChillsDB, an open-source
   database of validated audiovisual stimuli known to elicit chills in the
   US population. Results: Anhedonic participants who experienced chills
   demonstrated a significant increase in response bias (p = .004) towards
   rewards compared to those who did not experience chills. Highlighting
   specificity, no significant difference in reward bias was observed among
   LA participants. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the experience
   of chills has the potential to impact reward learning in anhedonic
   individuals, aligning with the known neurobiology of this phenomenon.
   These results highlight the potential of aesthetic chills as a novel
   approach to elicit and enhance positive affect in depressed populations.

AB Background: The intricate role of pain in non-suicidal self-injury
   (NSSI) makes the investigation of alterations in brain function during
   pain processing a critical yet underexplored topic. The aim of this
   study was to investigate fNIRS correlates of experimental pain and how
   these differed between adolescent patients engaging in NSSI and healthy
   controls. Methods: 154 adolescent patients with NSSI and 48 healthy
   controls underwent a heat pain stimulation with linearly increasing
   temperature from 32 degrees C to max. 50 degrees C, during which fNIRS
   activity was recorded. Associations between fNIRS activity and pain
   perception (i.e. pain threshold, pain tolerance and pain intensity) were
   examined using linear mixed models and linear regression analyses.
   Results: Across groups, we found a decrease in prefrontal oxygenation
   during increasing pain stimulation: Oxygenated hemoglobin was higher
   during baseline than during pain threshold (b = -0.36, p < .001) and
   higher during pain threshold than during pain tolerance (b = -0.10, p <
   .001). We did not find differential patterns of prefrontal oxygenation
   across the pain assessment between patients and healthy controls. Also,
   no association between pain intensity and fNIRS activity was found.
   Limitations: fNIRS was only recorded in prefrontal regions and our
   design did not include a non-painful stimulation as a control condition.
   Conclusion: While our study adds to the understanding of prefrontal
   hemodynamic changes associated with pain processing, it did not
   contribute further evidence to the few existing findings regarding
   altered neural processing of pain in adolescents engaging in NSSI.

AB Background: The involvement of cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) in the
   metabolism of quetiapine has been proposed, though conclusive evidence
   is lacking. This study aimed to quantitatively assess the impact of
   CYP3A5 genetic variability on quetiapine exposure in a Chinese patient
   population. Methods: Patient data were retrospectively collected from
   the database of the Mental Health Centre at the First Hospital of Hebei
   Medical University, covering the period from September 1, 2019, to July
   1, 2023. The study included patients genotyped for CYP3A5 who were
   treated with quetiapine. Inclusion criteria for the analysis of
   pharmacokinetic parameters, such as serum concentrations of the drug and
   its metabolites, included oral administration of quetiapine,
   availability of information on the prescribed daily dose and concomitant
   medications, and the determination of steady-state blood levels at the
   time of sampling (after at least 3 days of continuous administration at
   the same dose). Exclusion criteria comprised polypharmacy with known
   CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors, as well as patients with hepatic or renal
   insufficiency. The primary endpoint was the exposure to quetiapine and
   N-dealkylquetiapine, measured using dose-corrected concentrations (C/D).
   The secondary endpoint was the metabolism of quetiapine to
   N-dealkylquetiapine, assessed by the ratio of metabolite to parent drug
   concentrations. The third endpoint is the differences in adverse
   reactions, QTc intervals, and biochemical parameters among patients with
   different CYP3A5 genotypes. Result: Based on the inclusion and exclusion
   criteria, clinical data from 207 patients were ultimately included in
   the study. Of these, 20 patients had the CYP3A5*1/*1 genotype, 78 had
   the CYP3A5*1/*3 genotype, and 109 had the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype. The
   CYP3A5*3 variant was found to significantly impact the metabolism of
   quetiapine. The C/D values for both quetiapine and N-dealkyl quetiapine
   were notably higher in individuals with the *3/*3 genotype compared to
   those with the *1/*1 and *1/*3 genotypes (P-1 < 0.001 and P-2 = 0.002,
   respectively). A comparison of the variability in metabolic ratios among
   different genotype groups revealed no significant difference (P =
   0.067). However, a post hoc analysis indicated that the metabolic ratio
   in poor metabolizers was significantly lower than that in intermediate
   metabolizers (P = 0.021). The analysis of adverse reaction incidence and
   QTc intervals among different genotypes showed no statistically
   significant differences (P = 0.652, P = 0.486). However, comparison of
   biochemical parameters across different genotype groups revealed that
   alanine aminotransferase, uric acid, hemoglobin, and gamma-glutamyl
   transferase levels were significantly higher in patients with the
   CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype compared to those with the CYP3A5*1/*1 and
   CYP3A5*1/*3 genotypes. Conclusion: The results indicated that the
   genetic polymorphism of CYP3A5*3 significantly influences the metabolism
   of quetiapine. Specifically, carriers of the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype
   exhibited higher blood levels of quetiapine, with a greater likelihood
   of these levels exceeding the therapeutic range. This finding
   underscores the need for clinicians to pay special attention to the
   efficacy and occurrence of adverse reactions when prescribing quetiapine
   to patients carrying the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype.

AB Background: Neuroticism, known for its association with a greater risk
   of psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety, is a critical
   focus of research. Methods: Cis-expression quantitative trait loci
   (eQTLs) from 31,684 whole blood samples provided by the eQTLGen
   Consortium, alongside data from a large neuroticism cohort, were
   analyzed to identify genes causally linked to neuroticism. To further
   explore the influence of gene expression changes on neuroticism,
   colocalization analysis was conducted. Identified drug targets were
   assessed for potential side effects using a phenome-wide association
   study (PheWAS). Additionally, we utilized multiple databases to explore
   the interactions between drugs and genes for drug prediction and assess
   the current medications for drug repurposing. Results: The analysis
   involved a total of 4473 druggable genes, with two-sample Mendelian
   randomization (MR) identifying 186 genes that are causally linked to
   neuroticism. Colocalization analysis highlighted 11 genes (TLR4, MMRN1,
   EP300, BRAF, ORM1, ACVR1B, LRRC17, NOS2, ADAMTS6, GPX1, and VCL) with a
   posterior probability of colocalization (PPH4) >0.8. PheWAS revealed
   that drugs targeting BRAF, LRRC17, ADAMTS6, and GPX1 were also
   associated with other traits. Notably, six of these genes (TLR4, MMRN1,
   BRAF, ACVR1B, NOS2, and GPX1) are already being explored for drug
   development in psychiatric and other diseases. Conclusion: This study
   pinpointed six genes as promising therapeutic targets for neuroticism.
   The repurposing and development of drugs targeting these genes hold
   potential for managing neuroticism and associated psychiatric disorders.

AB Background: The occurrence of PTSD, depression, and anxiety is notably
   high among older adults following an earthquake. This research aimed to
   assess the prevalence and determinants of mental health conditions among
   older survivors after an earthquake. Methods: The review was conducted
   in accordance with the PRISMA process. A comprehensive search was
   conducted across various databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of
   Science, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, SinoMed, China National
   Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the VIP Database for Chinese Technical
   Periodicals, and the Wan Fang Database for Chinese Periodicals for
   studies reporting on the prevalence of PTSD, depression, and anxiety
   among older survivors post-earthquake. Each database was searched from
   inception to August 1, 2023 each database, and updated the search on
   October 1, 2024. The random effects model was employed to conduct
   meta-analysis, and the I2 index was taken into account to evaluate
   heterogeneity among studies. A narrative synthesis was performed to
   identify the risk factors associated with these mental health
   conditions. Results: A total of 33 studies were analyzed in this
   meta-analysis, mainly from China, Japan, Nepal, and Mexico. The
   prevalence rates of PTSD, depression, and anxiety among older earthquake
   survivors were found to be 19.3 % (95 % CI [16.0-22.6 %]; I2 = 99.486 %,
   P = 0.000), 23.5 % (95 % CI [13.9-33.1 %]; I2 = 99.901 %, P = 0.000) and
   10.9 % (95 % CI [6.7-15.1 %]; I2 = 99.287 %, P = 0.000), respectively.
   The identified major risk factors were categorized into four dimensions,
   including demographic variables (e.g., older age, chronic illness),
   predisaster mitigation variables (e.g., lack of insurance), responding
   in disaster variables (e.g., being injured, property damage) and
   post-disaster relief variables (e.g., inadequate psychological care, low
   levels of social/ family support). Limitations: The optimal cut-off for
   different screening tools may be sensitive to changes in the prevalence
   of older survivors post-earthquake. Furthermore, due to the
   heterogeneity of the studies, a narrative synthesis of risk factors was
   conducted. Conclusions: The findings of this review may increase the
   awareness of the burden and risk factors associated with PTSD,
   depression, and anxiety in older survivors post-earthquake. It serves as
   a reference for the government in formulating recovery policies focusing
   on interventions, such as financial allocation, psychological treatment,
   and insurance claims. These policies aim to mitigate the long-term
   psychological effects on older survivors and ultimately lower the
   prevalence of mental health conditions.

AB Background: Despite growing evidence linking loneliness and depressive
   symptoms, the underlying pathways remain unclear. This study aims to
   assess the impact of loneliness on depressive symptoms among Chinese
   adolescents and investigate the potential mediating role of sleep
   disturbance. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between
   November and December 2021. Loneliness, depressive symptoms, and sleep
   disturbance were assessed using the UCLA Loneliness Scale, the 9-item
   Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index
   questionnaire, respectively. Baron and Kenny's causal steps method and
   the Karlson-Holm-Breen method were applied to explore the mediating role
   of sleep disturbance. Subgroup analysis by gender was also conducted.
   Results: A total of 6838 adolescents were included, with 52.2 % boys and
   a mean age of 14.5 (SD = 1.6) years. Approximately 15.8 % of the
   adolescents reported depressive symptoms. Loneliness was positively
   associated with depressive symptoms after controlling for covariates (OR
   = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.31-1.36). After incorporating sleep disturbance into
   the model, the association was still significant (OR = 1.28, 95%CI =
   1.25-1.31). Sleep disturbance partially mediated this association,
   contributing to 18.89 % of the total effects. The associations and
   mediation effects were consistent across both genders, with no
   moderating effect of gender observed. Limitations: The cross-sectional
   design limits the ability to establish causality. Conclusion: Loneliness
   was significantly associated with depressive symptoms in Chinese
   adolescents and this association was partially mediated by sleep
   disturbance. Interventions aimed at reducing loneliness and improving
   sleep quality may help lower the risk of depressive symptoms in Chinese
   adolescents, regardless of genders. Nevertheless, further randomized
   controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.

AB Elevated youth irritability is characterized by increased proneness to
   frustration relative to peers when rewards are blocked, and is a
   transdiagnostic symptom that predicts multiple forms of psychopathology
   and poorer socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood. Although mechanistic
   models propose that irritability is the result of aberrant
   reward-related brain function, youth irritability as it relates to
   multiple components of reward processes, including reward anticipation,
   gain, and loss, has yet to be examined in large, population-based
   samples. Data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD)
   baseline sample (N = 5923) was used to examine associations between
   youth irritability (measured by parent-report) and reward-related brain
   activation and connectivity in a large, preadolescent sample.
   Preadolescents (M age = 9.96 years, SD = 0.63) performed the Monetary
   Incentive Delay task during functional MRI acquisition. In the task,
   during the anticipation period, participants were informed of the
   upcoming trial type (win money, lose money, no money at stake) and
   waited to hit a target; during the feedback period, participants were
   informed of their success. Whole brain and region of interest (ROI)
   analyses evaluated task conditions in relation to irritability level.
   Preadolescents with higher compared to lower levels of irritability
   demonstrated blunted prefrontal cortex activation in the anticipation
   period and exaggerated striatum-prefrontal connectivity differences
   among reward conditions during the feedback period. These effects
   persisted after adjusting for co-occurring anxiety, depression, and
   attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder symptoms. These findings
   provide evidence for the role of reward salience in pathophysiological
   models of youth irritability, suggesting a mechanism that may contribute
   to exaggerated behavioral responses.

AB Background: No previous research has specifically investigated the
   relationship between postoperative glycemic variability (GV) and acute
   kidney disease (AKD) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In this
   study, several methods of modelling postoperative GV were used to
   examine the association between GV and AKD risk and subtypes of AKD.
   Methods: We undertook a retrospective study involving a total of 8,090
   adult patients from three academic medical centers in Eastern China who
   underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass between 2015 and
   2023. Seven-day postoperative GV was calculated using the standard
   deviation (SD), coefficient of variation (CV), mean amplitude of
   glycemic excursion (MAGE), average daily risk range (ADRR), and time out
   of target range (TOR). The primary focus was on the occurrence of AKD
   between 8 and 90 days post-surgery, which was further categorized into
   persistent AKD and delayed AKD depending on the acute kidney injury
   (AKI) status in the first 7 days. Results: During the 8-90 days
   postoperative period, AKD occurred in 522 out of 8,090 patients (6.5%).
   Seven-day postoperative GV was significantly and consistently higher in
   the AKD group (p<0.001 for each metric). After adjusting for relevant
   covariates, 7-day GV metrics were significantly associated with elevated
   AKD risk (standardized hazard ratio (SHR):1.20 (95% confidence interval
   (CI): (1.12 - 1.27) for SD; SHR: 1.30 (95% CI: 1.201.40) for TOR). GV
   was correlated with persistent AKD, while no statistically significant
   association was observed between GV and delayed AKD. Unique cutoff
   thresholds were calculated for each GV metric to provide a quantitative
   indicator of high GV, enhancing its practical utility. Conclusions: Our
   study highlights the association between postoperative GV and increased
   AKD risk, and identifies specific GV thresholds in adults undergoing
   cardiac surgery.

AB Glutathione (GSH) is a master antioxidant which primarily protects cells
   from oxidative stress. Clinical studies have found significant depletion
   of GSH from the hippocampus in patients with mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI), a transitional stage before conversion to Alzheimer's disease
   (AD). Significant depletion of GSH is considered an early diagnostic
   biomarker of AD. Postmortem studies have confirmed significant GSH
   depletion in hippocampal tissue in MCI patients. The stability of GSH in
   different microenvironments is essential to validate GSH as a reliable
   biomarker for AD. Accordingly, we have conducted longitudinal monitoring
   of GSH from various brain regions (frontal cortex (FC), parietal cortex
   (PC), occipital cortex (OC), and cerebellum (CER)) from healthy subjects
   using MEshcher-GArwood Point RESolved Spectroscopy (MEGA-PRESS) pulse
   sequence on a 3T scanner. Additionally, in vitro magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy (MRS) assessments were conducted longitudinally using the
   same study protocol involving GSH supplement in a physiologically
   relevant phosphate buffer solution (PBS). We report that GSH within the
   brain microenvironment of a healthy person remains stable over time.
   GSH, however, is susceptible to oxidation over time in a phosphate
   buffer environment. The stability of GSH in a longitudinal study in the
   brains of healthy individuals supports the consideration of GSH as a
   candidate for stable biomarker for AD.

AB Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is a common neurological complication
   of sepsis that is characterized by neuroinflammation, oxidative stress
   and apoptosis, which results in cognitive impairments in septic
   survivors. Despite numerous treatment options for this condition, none
   of them are definite. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the
   impact of morin, a flavone known for its neuroprotective and
   anti-inflammatory effects, against lipopolysaccharides-induced
   sepsis-associated encephalopathy in albino mice for 7 days. Mice were
   divided into 4 groups: Negative control, morin, septic, and septic
   morin-treated mice. Sepsis was induced by a single injection of
   lipopolysaccharides (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), morin (50 mg/kg b.
   wt.) was given orally, starting from 5 h after sepsis induction, then
   daily for 4 other days. Morin ameliorated septic structural and
   functional alternations as manifested by improving the survival rate,
   the behavioral functions, in addition to preserving and protecting the
   brain tissue. This was accompanied with the augmentation of the total
   antioxidant capacity, as well as the suppression of tissue levels of the
   lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde, apoptosis
   (cleaved-caspase-3), glial fibrillary acidic protein, and the
   proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor. In conclusion, morin has
   a promising ameliorative effect to counteract the sepsis-associated
   encephalopathy via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and to
   prevent the associated cognitive impairments.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of motor imagery (MI:
   imagining the success or failure of a forehand or backhand shot)
   training according to an internal visual modality centred on the
   movement and the target to be reached on tennis performance. 66 young
   (Mage = 12.1 years) players were randomly divided into three groups:
   control, failure MI or success MI, and performed 3 experimental phases.
   The pre-test consisted of performing 6 blocks of 5 forehand and backhand
   groundstrokes (sent randomly by a ball launcher towards the baseline)
   and a super tie-break. The acquisition phase consisted of 12 sessions,
   each including a standardized warm-up followed by 15 min of background
   rally in pairs. The participants of the MI group were instructed, after
   unprovoked errors on their part, to imagine performing the previous shot
   correctly (positive MI) or missing (failure MI). The post-test was
   identical to the pre-test. The efficiency score of shots and the number
   of errors committed at the pre- and post-test served as dependent
   variables. The results of this study indicate that participants in the
   success MI group performed better than the control and failure MI groups
   at post-test. The success MI, performed after errors, has positive
   effects on the quality of the shot and reduces the number of unforced
   errors of tennis players, while failure MI induces negative outcomes.
   The use of success MI, integrated in training session, is recommended.

   pheochromocytoma, initially diagnosed during a workup for thoracic pain.
   The patient's tumor was refractory to medical management, and surgical
   resection was ruled out due to high cardiovascular risk, stemming from
   cyanotic congenital heart disease, aortic aneurysm, and factor VII
   deficiency. The patient underwent adrenal artery embolization (AAE) as a
   salvage treatment. Following the procedure, there was an initial
   reduction in hypertensive crises and biochemical markers, with plasma
   normetanephrine levels decreasing from 1490 pg/mL to 313 pg/mL. However,
   over subsequent months, the patient experienced symptom recurrence, and
   biochemical relapse occurred, with normetanephrine levels rising to 742
   pg/mL by 3 months postprocedure. This case highlights the potential for
   AAE to provide short-term symptom relief and biochemical response;
   nevertheless, it may not be an effective long-term curative option. More
   collaborative and prospective studies are needed to assess its success

AB Sinusitis is a common condition that can lead to various neurological
   complications due to the spread of infection to the intracranial and
   orbital regions. Fortunately, the availability of antibiotics has
   significantly improved the prognosis of sinusitis-associated
   intracranial complications. As a result, the overall incidence of
   neurological complications arising from sinusitis remains low. We
   present a rare case of a 13-year-old male who developed epidural empyema
   and orbital cellulitis as a complication of acute sinusitis. The patient
   initially exhibited signs and symptoms of orbital cellulitis, including
   eyelid swelling, erythema, and pain. Subsequently, the patient's
   condition worsened, with the development of fever and an intensifying
   headache. Imaging revealed an epidural empyema, necessitating urgent

AB Objectives: To evaluate factors associated with sleep related injury
   (SRI) and persistent SRI (pSRI) in patients with isolated rapid eye
   movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). Methods: This is a
   retrospective cohort study. A total of 388 patients with iRBD were
   involved for a comprehensive review of sleep related injuries. SRI is
   defined as a lifetime history of injurious behaviors to self and/or bed
   partner, and pSRI is considered if injurious symptoms continued to occur
   frequently (>= 1/month). Correlations of SRI/pSRI with clinical,
   lifestyle and polysomnographic characteristics were analyzed. Results:
   Lifetime SRI was reported in 322 (83 %) patients (66.3 +/- 8.5 years
   old, male 77.0 %), with 19.3 % having severe injuries, including
   fractures (2.5 %) and subdural hemorrhage (1.2 %), while 7.5 % required
   medical attendance. SRI was related to more severe depressive features
   (P adj = 0.017), current alcohol drinking (P adj = 0.014) and higher
   mentalis phasic and tonic EMG activity (P adj = 0.042 and 0.048). After
   a mean follow-up of 5.1 years, 18.2 % of SRI patients (38/209) had pSRI
   despite intense treatment. Frequent nightmare at baseline (OR [95 % CI]
   = 1.43 [1.01, 2.03]), restless leg syndrome (OR [95 % CI] = 5.68 [1.42,
   22.64]) and adult-onset sleepwalking (OR [95 % CI] = 2.52 [1.10, 5.76])
   were associated with an increased risk of pSRI. Conclusions: SRI is
   common in patients with iRBD and 18 % had pSRI despite intensive
   treatment, emphasizing the importance of bedside safety. The
   identification of risk factors for SRI and pSRI underscores the need for
   systematic clinical screening and targeted interventions for at-risk
   patients.

AB Vascular hamartoma is an abnormal development of endothelial tissue that
   rarely affects horses. Histopathological examination remains the gold
   standard for definitive diagnosis, yet the presence of abnormal vascular
   structures must be carefully differentiated from other vascular
   anomalies and neoplasms. This report describes two cases of vascular
   proliferation affecting the skin on the lateral side over the left
   tarsus and the dorsolateral region over the fetlock joint of two
   fillies. The clinical history, presentation, and radiographic and
   sonographic findings in both patients suggested a neoplasm of unknown
   origin. Surgical excision of the mass was successfully performed in both
   patients. In one patient, a second surgery was performed six months
   after the first surgery because of the recurrence of the mass.
   Histopathological examination revealed a disorganized proliferation of
   well-differentiated, tortuous, and varied-sized blood vessels hemmed in
   myxoid tissue with abundant fibrocollagenous bands. Immunohistochemical
   examination of the endothelium markers factor VIII and ERG revealed
   positive staining of the mass samples in both cases, confirming their
   vascular origin. The combination of these markers was effective,
   providing a reliable option for differentiating vascular proliferation
   in horses. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first
   report applying the ERG endothelial marker to horse vascular
   malformations.

AB Esophageal diseases include esophageal obstruction, esophagitis,
   esophageal stricture, and esophageal diverticulum. Imaging can
   facilitate the selection of appropriate treatment options and assist in
   differential diagnosis. Esophageal obstruction in cattle is generally
   caused by greedy nature of chewing and swallowing of food and foreign
   structures, including stones, potatoes, trichobezoar, carrots,
   foodstuffs (i.e., hay), and rice chaff. Esophageal obstruction in cattle
   can also be caused by artificial procedures, and early detection and
   treatment are important to avoid severe esophageal injury and its
   associated risks. Herein, an 11-month-old Japanese black heifer
   presented with swelling and induration of the neck and snowball
   crepitation in the subcutaneous area of the left shoulder. Radiography
   and endoscopy revealed a spring-like foreign body in the esophagus and a
   cervical esophageal obstruction. Esophageal surgery confirmed that the
   foreign body was a ruminal mechanical stimulating brush (RB). The case
   died on day 8 after the initial examination. Pathological necropsy
   revealed that the RB had entered the esophageal diverticulum and caused
   esophageal obstruction. This case provides a valuable reminder about the
   risk of esophageal disease with oral administration procedures.

AB Background: While use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has become
   widespread in emergency medicine, its adoption and usage among emergency
   clinicians is variable. In this study, we explored the barriers and
   facilitators to POCUS use among emergency medicine clinicians in a
   tertiary care emergency department in the United States by clinical role
   and perceived usability of POCUS. Methods: We initially administered a
   quantitative survey via REDCap and used a validated technology usability
   scale to categorize clinicians into tertiles of low, moderate, and high,
   based on perceived utility of POCUS. Subsequently, a purposeful sample
   in each category participated in semi-structured interviews until
   thematic saturation was reached (9-10 per category, 29 total). The
   qualitative interviews were analyzed using Braun and Clark's content
   analysis approach. A coding scheme was developed through initial review
   of 20 % of the transcripts, followed by operational definitions of
   codes, concept and category development, and selection of representative
   quotes. Analysis was supported by Dedoose software. Results: We
   identified 41 % (12/29) as high POCUS users, 31 % (9/29) as moderate,
   and 28 % (8/29) as low, based on perceived usability. Interviewees
   consisted of 24 % (7/29) attendings, 28 % (8/29) residents and 48 %
   (14/29) advanced practice providers (APPs). Attendings made up 50 % in
   the high POCUS group and 75 % of the low POCUS group were APPs. In the
   low group, the lack of prior and present POCUS training was a major
   barrier to POCUS use. The lack of time during clinical shifts was a
   major barrier to POCUS utility in the high and low groups. Availability
   of POCUS machines in clinical spaces was identified as a facilitator to
   POCUS use in the medium group. Conclusions: Participants reported that
   POCUS facilitates patient disposition and clinical supervision enhances
   its use. Early POCUS education in professional school and continued
   POCUS training in clinical practice could facilitate POCUS use
   clinically. Structured POCUS courses and continued medical education
   programs may provide protected time to learn and practice POCUS.
   Moreover, accessible and standardized machines in the clinical
   environment could improve POCUS usage. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Organic acids reflect the course of all important metabolic processes
   and the effects of diet, nutrient deficiency, lifestyle, and microbiota
   composition. In present work, we focused on identifying age-related
   changes in organic acids in urine, and creating a neural network model
   based on them to determine biological age. The investigation involves
   data on concentrations of 60 organic acids in urine of 863 samples. Due
   to data analysis we found these acids could be used to determine human
   biological age. Two models were created for calculating biological age:
   a comprehensive AcidAGE model and a concise AcidAGE model based on 10
   indicators. Both models demonstrate high accuracy. The presented models
   are useful for dynamically assessing the impact of medical
   interventions, lifestyle and diet amendments, and taking nutraceuticals
   on overall health and the risk of disease occurrence or progression.
   Their advantage lies in their ability to quickly update estimates as the
   corresponding biological processes change.

AB BRCA mutations represent predictive biomarkers for treatment with PARPi.
   However, genetic testing presents challenges in clinical practice that
   may limit access to PARPi. We present a survey directed towards members
   of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology to highlight the level of
   implementation of national recommendations and issues associated with
   genetic testing. Better implementation of molecular testing to identify
   BRCAmutated patients is crucial for tailored treatment in mCRPC.
   Background: 20% of prostate cancer (PC) patients harbor germinal or
   somatic alterations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes,
   including BRCA1/2. BRCA mutations represent predictive biomarkers for
   treatment with polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose inhibitors (PARPi).
   Olaparib has shown efficacy in metastatic castration-resistant PC
   (mCRPC) and is currently approved in Italy for mCRPC with BRCA1/2
   mutations. National and international guidelines strongly recommend BRCA
   testing in PC. However, genetic testing presents challenges in clinical
   practice that may limit access to PARPi. Methods: we conducted a survey
   directed towards members of the Italian Association of Medical Oncology
   to highlight the level of implementation of national recommendations and
   issues associated with genetic testing. Through an anonymous
   questionnaire, the survey collected clinical data of PC patients
   undergoing BRCA testing and the main difficulties to face in conducting
   the analysis. Results: The survey was completed by 108 participants (5%
   of AIOM members). 52.8% of respondents test BRCA in all metastatic PC
   patients. If tissue analysis is invalid, only 17% use liquid biopsy, and
   15.7% always consider a re-biopsy of a metastatic lesion. A quarter of
   respondents have to outsource genetic testing to another center and
   17.6% have a split process between different institutions. Long
   timelines, lack of a predefined procedure, and unavailability of liquid
   biopsy represent the main issues based on respondents' opinions.
   Conclusions: BRCA testing in PC still presents several difficulties in
   clinical practice that can limit access to PARPi treatment. Better
   implementation of molecular testing to identify BRCA-mutated patients is
   crucial for tailored treatment in mCRPC.

AB Purpose: There are many radiological datasets for breast cancer, some
   which have supported the development of AI medical devices for breast
   cancer screening and image classification. This review aims to identify
   mammography datasets (including digitised screen film mammography, 2D
   digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis) used in the
   development of AI technologies and present their characteristics,
   including their transparency of documentation, content, populations
   included and accessibility. Materials and methods: MEDLINE and Google
   Dataset searches identified studies describing AI technology development
   and referencing breast imaging datasets up to June 2024. The
   characteristics of each dataset are summarised. In particular, the
   accompanying documentation was reviewed with a focus on diversity and
   inclusion of populations represented within each dataset. Results: 254
   datasets were referenced in the literature search, 190 were privately
   held, 36 had barriers which prevented access, and 28 were accessible.
   Most datasets originated from Europe, East Asia and North America. There
   was poor reporting of individuals' attributes: 32 (12 %) datasets
   reported race or ethnicity; 76 (30 %) reported female/male categories
   with only one dataset explicitly defining whether these categories
   represented sex or gender attributes. Conclusion: Through this review,
   we demonstrate gaps in the data landscape for mammography, highlighting
   poor representation globally. To ensure datasets in breast imaging have
   maximum utility for researchers, their characteristics should be
   documented and limitations of datasets, such as their representativeness
   of populations and settings, should inform scientific efforts to
   translate data-driven insights into technologies and discoveries.

   participation from a medical team throughout the various stages of this
   process. Methods: The TIMA committee scrutinized data for
   inconsistencies, implementing stringent rules for variables unlearned by
   the system. A sensitivity analysis determined 100,000 epochs, leading to
   the generation of 10,000 synthetic data. The model's performance was
   tested using a general-purpose dataset, comparing real and synthetic
   data. Results: Outcomes indicate the robustness of our model, with an
   average contingency score of 0.94 across variable pairs in synthetic and
   real data. Continuous variables exhibited a median correlation
   similarity score of 0.97. Novelty received a top score of 1. Principal
   Component Analysis (PCA) on synthetic values demonstrated diversity, as
   no patient pair displayed a zero or close-to-zero value distance.
   Remarkably, the TIMA committee's evaluation revealed that synthetic data
   was recognized as authentic by nearly 100%. Conclusions: Our trained
   model exhibited commendable performance, yielding high
   representativeness in the synthetic dataset compared to the original.
   The synthetic dataset proved realistic, boasting elevated levels of

AB Advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches have led to a
   remarkable reduction in the morbidity and mortality rates associated
   with a variety of diseases. In the context of acute ischemic heart
   disease, significant milestones have been achieved, beginning with the
   establishment of cardiac ICUs. These were pivotal in providing
   specialized care for patients with severe heart conditions. Subsequent
   to this development, methods to restore blood flow in areas compromised
   by arterial blockages were introduced. Initially, systemic thrombolysis
   was the primary method used, but it has since been largely supplanted by
   primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as primary
   coronary angioplasty, which is now the preferred treatment due to its
   effectiveness and safety. The incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac
   arrest (OHCA) where resuscitation attempts have been made, whether
   successful or not, is significant and presents a considerable challenge.
   Unfortunately, the mortality rate among these patients remains
   distressingly high, and efforts to reduce it are fraught with
   difficulty. It is crucial to acknowledge that survival from an OHCA does
   not automatically equate to a favorable clinical outcome, as serious
   neurological impairments are common sequelae of such events. In addition
   to mortality rates, the term "survival with favorable neurologic
   outcome" has emerged as another critical measure of the success of
   resuscitation efforts. This parameter underscores the importance of not
   only saving lives but also preserving the quality of life for survivors.
   The ability to restore both life and cognitive function is a testament
   to the comprehensiveness of care provided to OHCA patients.

AB Classification of images is an important process in the revolution of
   big data in healthcare. For classification and diagnosis, several
   developments have considerably improved digital clinical image
   processing. In many applications of medical imaging, medical image
   classification is a very essential task. Convolutional Neural Networks
   (CNNs) have displayed better performance in the classification of images
   for medical systems. However, CNN and conventional standardized
   classifiers suffer limitations in their performance due to a few
   reliability concerns, such as overfitting issues, feature extraction
   inefficiencies, and computational complexity. Therefore, a novel
   approach to medical image classification is proposed in this paper
   employing a three-tiered model that differs from conventional frameworks
   of multi-class classification to overcome these problems. In the first
   tier, the preparation of data includes the collection and transformation
   of five various clinical types of datasets such as Octoscope, Skin
   Cancer (PAD-UFES-20), The Kvasir dataset, Covid-19 dataset, and Chest
   X-Ray Images (Pneumonia). The stage of pre-processing guarantees the raw
   data is cleansed and organized for efficient analysis and training. In
   the second tier, sophisticated feature extraction utilizes a Multi-head
   Self-attention Progressive Learning Network on pre-processed data. The
   mechanism of Multi-head Self-attention and the techniques of Progressive
   Learning are leveraged to improve feature extraction, providing superior
   performance than traditional methods. In the third tier, the
   classification of features that are extracted is performed through
   Inception Residual Network-VGG19 (IRNet-VGG19), which combines the
   strengths of both Inception modules and the deep architecture of VGG19
   to upgrade the accuracy of classification further. By evaluating all
   five datasets, the performance of IRNet-VGG19 shows better
   classification outcomes when compared with other existing approaches.
   The accuracies of classification on five different datasets are achieved
   as 0.993, 0.966, 0.994, 0.984, and 0.968 respectively, outperforming
   other challenging methods.

AB Deep learning technologies have dramatically reshaped the field of
   medical image registration over the past decade. The initial
   developments, such as regression-based and U-Net-based networks,
   established the foundation for deep learning in image registration.
   Subsequent progress has been made in various aspects of deep
   learning-based registration, including similarity measures, deformation
   regularizations, network architectures, and uncertainty estimation.
   These advancements have not only enriched the field of image
   registration but have also facilitated its application in a wide range
   of tasks, including atlas construction, multi- atlas segmentation,
   motion estimation, and 2D-3D registration. In this paper, we present a
   comprehensive overview of the most recent advancements in deep
   learning-based image registration. We begin with a concise introduction
   to the core concepts of deep learning-based image registration. Then, we
   delve into innovative network architectures, loss functions specific to
   registration, and methods for estimating registration uncertainty.
   Additionally, this paper explores appropriate evaluation metrics for
   assessing the performance of deep learning models in registration tasks.
   Finally, we highlight the practical applications of these novel
   techniques in medical imaging and discuss the future prospects of deep
   learning-based image registration.

AB Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is constantly used for
   delineating organs-at-risk (OARs) in radiation therapy planning. The
   delineated OARs are needed to transfer from CECT to non-contrast CT
   (NCCT) for dose calculation. Yet, the use of iodinated contrast agents
   (CA) in CECT and the dose calculation errors caused by the spatial
   misalignment between NCCT and CECT images pose risks of adverse side
   effects. A promising solution is synthesizing CECT images from NCCT
   scans, which can improve the visibility of organs and abnormalities for
   more effective multi-organ segmentation in NCCT images. However,
   existing methods neglect the difference between tissues induced by CA
   and lack the ability to synthesize the details of organ edges and blood
   vessels. To address these issues, we propose a contrast-enhanced
   knowledge and anatomical perception network (CKAP-Net) for NCCT-to-CECT
   synthesis. CKAP-Net leverages a contrast- enhanced knowledge learning
   network to capture both similarities and dissimilarities in domain
   characteristics attributable to CA. Specifically, a CA-based perceptual
   loss function is introduced to enhance the synthesis of CA details.
   Furthermore, we design a multi-scale anatomical perception transformer
   that utilizes multi-scale anatomical information from NCCT images,
   enabling the precise synthesis of tissue details. Our CKAP-Net is
   evaluated on a multi-center abdominal NCCT-CECT dataset, ahead an neck
   NCCT-CECT dataset, and an NCMRI-CEMRI dataset. It achieves a MAE of
   25.96 +/- 2.64, a SSIM of 0.855 +/- 0.017, and a PSNR of 32.60 +/- 0.02
   for CECT synthesis, and a DSC of 81.21 +/- 4.44 for segmentation on the
   internal dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CKAP-Net
   outperforms state-of-the-art CA synthesis methods and has better
   generalizability across different datasets.

AB Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequently diagnosed form of skin
   cancer, and its incidence continues to rise, particularly among older
   individuals. This trend puts a significant strain on health care
   systems, especially in terms of histopathologic diagnostics required for
   Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), which is used to treat BCC in sensitive
   locations to minimize tissue loss. This study aims to address the
   challenges in BCC detection within MMS whole-slide images by developing
   and evaluating a deep learning model that bridges weakly supervised
   learning with interpretable segmentation-based methods through attention
   maps. Utilizing data sets from 2 medical centers, the model demonstrated
   an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)
   of 0.958 on internal testing and an AUC of 0.934 on an independent third
   external data set despite no fine-tuning or preprocessing for the
   latter. Attention maps provided insights into the model's decision
   making, highlighting critical regions for slide-level classification.
   The sensitivity of the attention maps in localizing tumor regions was
   0.853 when no filtering was applied and gave 8 revision false positives
   per slide on average and was reduced to an average of 2 false positives
   per slide with a sensitivity of 0.873 when detections smaller than 200
   mm were removed from the attention maps. These findings indicate that
   the deep learning model is highly effective in detecting BCC in MMS
   whole-slide images, with robust performance across different data sets
   and conditions. The use of attention maps enhances the model's
   interpretability, making it a promising tool for aiding
   dermatopathologists and MMS surgeons. (c) 2024 THE AUTHORS. Published by

AB BackgroundWith improvements in long-term graft function and survival, an
   increasing population of pediatric liver transplant (LT) recipients now
   require adult care. A process to successfully transition young adults to
   adult LT centers is supported in the literature with discussions on the
   rationale for health care transition (HCT), barriers to transition,
   stakeholder perspectives, and transfer readiness (TR). Results of
   outcomes studies are difficult to generalize and there remains no
   standard of care for HCT in LT. Of concern is that the youth's
   increasing independence occurs during a period of developmental
   vulnerability, with a threat to graft function due to risk-taking
   behaviors, specifically nonadherence, that may lead to rejection, graft
   loss, and death.Objectives/MethodThe purpose of this comprehensive
   literature review is to discuss current knowledge, practices, and
   outcomes of HCT for LT recipients with additional support from
   literature in solid organ transplant (SOT) and pediatric-onset chronic
   conditions literature.ResultsRecent position statements in LT and SOT
   express a greater awareness of the importance of HCT with broad
   agreement that reflects a similarity in approach in endorsing HCT as an
   essential process that should be initiated in early adolescence with TR
   as a primary determinant of transfer; however, standardization with
   consistent outcomes measurement is lacking. The literature supports
   transition as an esential component of care that should be initated in
   early adolescence with programs that address knowlege,
   skill-development, and advocacy. The engagement of all stakeholders in
   LT is essential to program development.ConclusionsThere is increasing
   awareness among the multidisciplinary team of the importance and role of
   the adult provider in extending transitional care into the adult setting
   as executive functioning skills mature. Outcome measures need to be
   clearly defined and standardized. Regulatory agency involvement to
   validate and support the need for TOC programs is crucial and should
   promote outcomes research for best practice program standardization.

AB In this study, we present a cutting-edge ensemble of deep learning
   models- DenseNet-201, EfficientNet, and ConvNeXt tailored for precise
   classification of White Blood Cells (WBCs), a crucial aspect of
   hematological analysis. Leveraging the Raabin WBC and Large Diverse WBC
   datasets, our approach encompasses the identification of five distinct
   WBC types, facilitating an in-depth study of cellular morphology
   variations. Each component of our ensemble brings distinct advantages:
   DenseNet-201 captures essential morphological features, EfficientNet
   deals effectively with varying image qualities and resolutions, and
   ConvNeXt excels in feature representation and processing efficiency. Our
   ensemble model integrates the strengths of multiple models, enhancing
   accuracy beyond traditional single-model approaches. It employs transfer
   learning with pretrained ImageNet weights to optimize learning
   efficiency, and consolidates outputs into a single vector for precise
   predictions. The model uses the sliding window technique for validation,
   significantly improving its performance in classifying WBCs.
   Demonstrating superior performance with a 97.8% accuracy rate, 97.0%
   precision, 97.0% sensitivity, and a 97.0% F1-score, our ensemble model
   exceeds existing methods. This highlights its potential to automate WBC
   classification, thereby reducing manual errors and saving diagnostic
   time. Additionally, we enhance model interpretability through Grad-CAM
   and heatmap visualizations, offering insights into decision-making
   processes. The ensemble's benefits include robust performance across
   diverse conditions, reduced overfitting risk, and improved
   interpretability and adaptability. Demonstrating exceptional predictive
   accuracy and reliability, our model holds promise for revolutionizing
   hematological diagnostics and patient care. Looking ahead, we aim to
   explore the ensemble's application to broader medical imaging tasks and
   investigate alternative ensemble strategies. Our ensemble model stands
   as a powerful tool for automated WBC classification, promising
   significant advances in medical imaging and diagnostics.

AB Study objective: We hypothesize that personalized perioperative blood
   pressure management maintaining intraoperative mean arterial pressure
   (MAP) above the preoperative mean nighttime MAP reduces
   perfusion-related organ injury compared to maintaining intraoperative
   MAP above 65 mmHg in patients having major non-cardiac surgery. Before
   testing this hypothesis in a large-scale trial, we performed this
   bicentric pilot trial to determine a) if performing preoperative
   automated nighttime blood pressure monitoring to calculate personalized
   intraoperative MAP targets is feasible; b) in what proportion of
   patients the preoperative mean nighttime MAP clinically meaningfully
   differs from a MAP of 65 mmHg; and c) if maintaining intraoperative MAP
   above the preoperative mean nighttime MAP is feasible in patients having
   major non-cardiac surgery. Design: Bicentric pilot randomized trial.
   Setting: University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany,
   and RWTH Aachen University Hospital, Aachen, Germany. Patients: Patients
   >= 45 years old having major non-cardiac surgery. Interventions:
   Personalized blood pressure management. Measurements: Proportion of
   patients in whom preoperative automated nighttime blood pressure
   monitoring was possible; proportion of patients in whom the preoperative
   mean nighttime MAP clinically meaningfully differed from a MAP of 65
   mmHg (difference > +/- 10 mmHg); intraoperative time-weighted average
   MAP below the preoperative mean nighttime MAP. Main results: We enrolled
   105 patients and randomized 98 patients. In 98 patients (93 %),
   preoperative automated nighttime blood pressure monitoring was possible.
   In 83 patients (85 %), the preoperative mean nighttime MAP clinically
   meaningfully differed from a MAP of 65 mmHg. The median time-weighted
   average MAP below the preoperative mean nighttime MAP was 3.29 (1.64,
   6.82) mmHg in patients assigned to personalized blood pressure
   management. Conclusions: It seems feasible to determine the effect of
   personalized perioperative blood pressure management maintaining
   intraoperative MAP above the preoperative mean nighttime MAP on
   postoperative complications in a large multicenter trial.

AB Nowadays, Manganese (Mn) become an unavoidable ingredient in
   agriculture, medical and manufacturing industries. Manganese deficiency
   is rare, and even though recurrent exposure to manganese is inevitable
   for humans, concerns have been voiced regarding public health hazards.
   This research was designed to evaluate the manganese toxicity and
   potential protective effects of turmeric in Swiss albino male mice.
   Eight-week albino mice (33 +/- 01 g) were randomized equally into seven
   groups (n = 10), as control (untreated), VC-I (received 0.1 ml of saline
   water), Mn-I, Mn-II & Mn-III administrated manganese (5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg
   & 20 mg/kg body-weight (B.W.) respectively), Mn + Tu (co-administrated
   with 20 mg/kg Mn &100 mg/kg B. W turmeric), VC-II (received 0.1 ml of
   olive oil), orally for four weeks consecutively. Before administrations,
   ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), total phenolic content (TPC)
   and gass chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC- MS) assays were performed
   to assess the antioxidant capacity of turmeric. After 28 days of dosing,
   mice were acclimatized for 10 days, then sacrificed and recovered
   samples (tissues & blood). Morphological observations showed changes in
   color, shape disruption, dilation and flattening of organs as compared
   to controls. Morphometric studies showed that the average body weight,
   organs weight and size of Mn intoxicated mice reduced remarkably (P <=
   0.05) as compared to control groups. Sideways Mn + Tu group showed
   non-significant change in both parameters. Hematological (CBC) and
   biochemical markers, liver function test & renal function test (LFT &
   RFT) showed significant differences in manganese groups against
   controls. Histopathological findings of both tissues (liver & kidney)
   showed multiple anatomic alterations in Mn exposed as compared to other
   groups. While the aforementioned deviations were less obvious in Mn + Tu
   administrated group. Manganese also decreased glutathione-s-transferase,
   superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione contents and increased lipid
   peroxidation as compared to control groups. It is concluded by the
   abovementioned findings that turmeric showed remedial efficacy against
   Mn-instigated histomorphometric, biochemical and enzymatic alterations
   in mice.

AB Reconstructing high-fidelity magnetic resonance (MR) images from
   under-sampled k-space is a commonly used strategy to reduce scan time.
   The posterior sampling of diffusion models based on the real measurement
   data holds significant promise of improved reconstruction accuracy.
   However, traditional posterior sampling methods often lack effective
   data consistency guidance, leading to inaccurate and unstable
   reconstructions. Implicit neural representation (INR) has emerged as a
   powerful paradigm for solving inverse problems by modeling a signal's
   attributes as a continuous function of spatial coordinates. In this
   study, we present a novel posterior sampler for diffusion models using
   INR, named DiffINR. The INR-based component incorporates both the
   diffusion prior distribution and the MRI physical model to ensure high
   data fidelity. DiffINR demonstrates superior performance on
   in-distribution datasets with remarkable accuracy, even under high
   acceleration factors (up to R = 12 in single-channel reconstruction).
   Furthermore, DiffINR exhibits excellent generalizability across various
   tissue contrasts and anatomical structures with low uncertainty.
   Overall, DiffINR significantly improves MRI reconstruction in terms of
   accuracy, generalizability and stability, paving the way for further
   accelerating MRI acquisition. Notably, our proposed framework can be a
   generalizable framework to solve inverse problems in other medical
   imaging tasks.

AB Metacomposites with negative permittivity have attracted widespread
   attention due to their great application prospects in electromagnetic
   wave absorption, biosensors, electronic devices, and other fields. In
   this work, by designing nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) and preparing
   film with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), weakly negative permittivity in the
   radio frequency band is obtained when NPC content reaches 20 wt%. In
   NPC, the electrons around the doped nitrogen atoms are highly localized,
   reducing the carrier concentration. In addition, the doped nitrogen
   makes the band structure flatter, resulting in an increase in the
   effective electron mass. These two strategies reduce the plasma
   frequency, thereby achieving weakly negative permittivity (about - 40)
   from 10 kHz to 1 MHz. Moreover, the porous structure is conducive to
   electron transfer, achieving high carrier mobility and thus obtaining
   low dielectric dispersion, so that the negative permittivity is
   maintained at around - 40 in the range of 10 kHz to 1 MHz, which is
   almost unaffected by frequency. Furthermore, the film exhibits sensitive
   sensing performance to human motion and can be used as a wearable sensor
   to detect human motion. It also shows great application potential in
   wearable medical electronic devices, wearable invisible cloaks, and
   other fields.Graphical abstractHere, metacomposite with weakly negative
   permittivity at radio frequency is designed, via fabricating polyvinyl
   alcohol/nitrogen-doped porous carbon (PVA/NPC) film. Theory calculations
   demonstrate that doped-N atoms reduce carrier concentration and enhance
   effective electrons mass, through introducing localized electrons around
   N atoms and flatting band structure, respectively. Moreover, this film
   exhibits excellent capacitive sensing performance and is used in
   wearable devices

   China, this study estimates the role of clean heating policy in
   decreasing the probabilities of having physical diseases for residents.
   Findings show that clean heating policy significantly induces an
   improvement in the physical health of people, and it leads to a 1.3 %
   decrease in the probability of having a respiratory disease. Besides,
   the beneficial effect of clean heating policy is much larger for the
   elderly and the low-income people. Clean heating policy improves
   regional air quality, raises residents' environmental awareness, and
   drives them to take avoidance behavior, which has a beneficial effect on
   their health. The cost-benefit analysis indicates that short-term health
   benefits from the decreased defensive expenditures and the reduced
   medical expenditures are larger than the total costs of the policy.
   These findings imply that clean heating policy is an effective strategy
   to improve environmental quality and social welfare, and perhaps the
   differentiated policy that favors the elderly and the poor groups can be
   more efficient.

AB Background and Objectives Patients with liver failure experience long
   hospitalizations and acute neurologic complications. Encephalopathy
   limits the bedside examination, rendering presenting signs of acute
   brain injury less specific. Seizures are common. Brain MRI is the gold
   standard for detecting acute brain injury, but intensive medical needs
   may preclude immediate transfer for imaging. EEG is a bedside test
   applied in cases of seizure or encephalopathy. We hypothesized that EEG
   variables can predict MRI signs of acute brain injury in children
   hospitalized with liver failure. Methods In this retrospective cohort
   analysis, records were collected for patients admitted to a MedStar
   hospital between 2014 and 2022 with ICD-9/10 codes related to liver
   failure, who underwent brain MRI and EEG testing during the same
   admission. Exclusion criteria included age older than 24 years and >7
   days elapsing between EEG and MRI testing. Clinical data of interest
   from chart review, reinterpreted MRI scans, reinterpreted EEG tracings,
   and quantitative EEG variables were compiled into a database.
   Quantitative EEG variables were processed using MNE-Python. Results Of
   746 records screened, 52 patients met inclusion criteria comprising 63
   EEG-MRI pairs. Univariate analysis of all quantitative EEG variables of
   interest showed depressed theta-alpha variability (TAV) when paired MRI
   involved abnormal restricted diffusivity in cortical or deep gray matter
   structures (TAV 0.705, SD 0.310; p < 0.001) compared with MRI with no
   abnormal restricted diffusivity (TAV 0.895, SD 0.095). Multilinear
   regression analysis including potential confounders demonstrated
   independent association of depressed TAV with this MRI finding, with an
   odds ratio of 4.0317 (95% CI 1.3868-11.7165; AUROC 0.83). Discussion
   Depressed TAV on EEG is associated with increased odds of abnormal
   restricted diffusivity in gray matter on brain MRI in children and young
   adults hospitalized with liver failure. This MRI finding is seen in
   scenarios where changes to medical management are time-sensitive (i.e.,
   acute stroke and PRES) or where prognostic discussion may be influenced
   by MRI findings (hypoxic-ischemic injury). TAV thus has a potential role
   as an automated, bedside decision support tool for clinicians deciding
   on the urgency of brain MRI in critically ill patients.

AB Background and ObjectivesPrior research has shown several health
   disparities affecting sexual minority people. Research on the neurologic
   health of sexual minority people has been limited. Our objective was to
   characterize the prevalence of neurologic disease and utilization of a
   neurologist among a population of sexual minority people.MethodsWe
   conducted a cross-sectional analysis of sexual minority people, using
   people in same-sex relationships as a proxy for sexual minority status,
   from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) from 2016 to 2020. The
   MEPS is a government-run survey that uses complex sampling to obtain a
   nationally representative sample. Our primary outcome was a diagnosis of
   any neurologic disease. We also completed stratified analyses by sex,
   race, and ethnicity. Our secondary outcome was visit to a neurologist
   within the past year. Logistic regression was used to compare the odds
   of both outcomes in those in same-sex relationships and those in
   different-sex relationships.ResultsAmong 153,313 MEPS participants,
   there were 61,645 (40.2%) participants in relationships who were
   included in our sample. Of those, 822 (1.33%) participants were in
   same-sex relationships. Participants were, on average, aged 51 years
   (median 50 years, IQR 38-63); nearly 50% reported female sex and mostly
   non-Hispanic White (67.81%). Among those in same-sex relationships,
   22.7% reported a neurologic diagnosis compared with 18.1% of those in
   different-sex relationships (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.04-1.71). This difference
   was maintained with adjustment for age, sex, education, and insurance
   (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.15-1.91). There was no significant difference in
   visit to a neurologist (adjusted OR 1.38; 95% CI 0.91-2.10).DiscussionIn
   this nationally representative sample, neurologic disease was more
   prevalent among those in same-sex relationships compared with those in
   different-sex relationships. Limited sample size and absent measurements
   of minority stress limited the etiologic search for factors driving this
   disparity. There was no significant difference in visit to a
   neurologist, and both groups reported their overall health as being
   similar. There is a need for more routine measurement of sexual
   orientation in neurologic research. This will allow us to detail
   differences in neurologic disease risk factors, prevalence, and
   outcomes. The end goal is the identification of opportunities for
   intervention and advancement of neurologic health equity.

AB Background and ObjectivesMany neurodegenerative syndromes present with
   impairment of frontal networks, especially frontoinsular networks
   affecting social and emotional cognition. People presenting with frontal
   network impairments may be considered for a frontotemporal dementia
   (FTD) diagnosis. We sought to examine the diagnostic mix of patients
   referred with frontal network impairments to a single cognitive
   neurology service.MethodsA retrospective review was conducted of all
   patients seen between January 2010 and December 2019 at the Eastern
   Cognitive Disorders Clinic, a quaternary cognitive neurology clinic in
   Melbourne, Australia. Patients were included if they met the following
   criteria: (1) were referred for suspected FTD or with a preexisting
   diagnosis of a FTD syndrome, (2) were referred for 'frontal behaviors'
   (i.e., disinhibition, disorganization, poor judgment, loss of empathy,
   apathy) and/or had an informant report of behavior change, and (3) had
   available referral documents and clinical consensus diagnosis. Referral
   diagnosis was compared against final diagnosis adjudicated by a
   consensus multidisciplinary team. Case details including age of symptom
   onset, Cambridge Behavioural Inventory-Revised scores, psychiatric
   history, and Charlson Comorbidity Index were compared against the final
   diagnosis.ResultsIn total, 161 patients aged 42-82 years (mean = 64.5,
   SD = 9.0; 74.5% men) met inclusion criteria. The commonest final
   diagnosis was a FTD syndrome (44.6%: 26.7% behavioral variant FTD
   (bvFTD), 9.3% progressive supranuclear palsy, 6.2% semantic dementia,
   1.2% corticobasal syndrome, and 1.2% FTD/motor neuron disease). A
   primary psychiatric disorder (PPD) was the next commonest diagnosis
   (15.5%), followed by vascular cognitive impairment (VCI, 10.6%),
   Alzheimer disease (AD, 9.9%), and other neurologic diagnoses (6.2%). A
   final diagnosis of bvFTD was associated with higher rates of medical
   comorbidities and more eating behavior abnormalities compared with a
   diagnosis of PPD. Screening cognitive tests and preexisting psychiatric
   history did not distinguish these 2 groups.DiscussionA broad spectrum of
   neurologic and psychiatric disorders may present with impairments to
   frontal networks. Almost half of patients referred had a final FTD
   syndrome diagnosis, with bvFTD the commonest final diagnosis. People
   with PPD, VCI, and AD present with similar clinical profiles but are
   distinguishable using MRI and FDG-PET imaging. Medical and psychiatric
   comorbidities are common in people with bvFTD.

AB Background and Objectives Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a complex of
   symptoms and signs comprising limb rigidity, bradykinesia, dystonia,
   myoclonus, apraxia, cortical sensory loss, and a variety of cognitive
   and language impairments. CBS is commonly seen in tauopathies. Striking
   asymmetry in clinical and imaging findings in CBS raises questions about
   potential triggers initiating neurodegeneration. The objective of this
   study was to investigate potential central or peripheral triggers
   preceding CBS symptoms. Methods In this retrospective observational
   study, we reviewed medical records of patients with CBS at our
   Parkinson's Disease Center and Movement Disorders Clinic, focusing on
   evidence of possible central or peripheral "trigger" occurring within a
   year before the onset of CBS. We also reviewed records of patients with
   Parkinson disease (PD) for comparison. Results Of the 72 patients with
   CBS, 15 (20.8%) reported potential focal triggers before the onset of
   CBS-related neurologic symptoms. By contrast, only 1 of 72 patients with
   PD (1.4%) had a documented trigger before the onset of PD-related
   symptoms (p < 0.001). Of potential triggers, 13 were peripheral (related
   to hand or shoulder surgeries or trauma) and 2 were central (stroke and
   head trauma). Patients with CBS with triggers were younger, had earlier
   symptom onset, comprised a higher proportion of men, and had a higher
   likelihood of limb onset of symptoms than those without. Discussion Our
   finding of relatively high frequency of focal triggers in CBS compared
   with PD suggests potential central or peripheral triggers initiating
   neurodegeneration, possibly explaining asymmetric clinical and imaging
   features in CBS. Further research is necessary to validate and explore
   this observation's implications for CBS pathogenesis.

AB Background and Objectives In 2017, the FDA approved deutetrabenazine
   (AUSTEDO) for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia (TD) and chorea
   associated with Huntington disease (HD). Concurrently, valbenazine
   (INGREZZA) was approved specifically for TD. The adoption of new
   medications is influenced by various factors, including patient's
   medical needs, the prescriber's adoption of new practice, and external
   environmental factors (e.g., cost). Our analysis aims to examine the
   dissemination of 2 vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2)
   inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, in the market. Methods In
   this cross-sectional study, we conducted a descriptive statistical
   analysis of the 2017-2020 prescription records for deutetrabenazine and
   valbenazine using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Medicare
   Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Part D Prescriber public use
   file. In addition, we linked this data set to the Open Payment database
   to analyze industry payments. Results We identified a total of 3,706
   deutetrabenazine prescribers and 4,895 valbenazine prescribers.
   Prescription volume (standardized 30-day prescription) increased
   annually across different specialties for both VMAT-2 inhibitors from
   2017 to 2020. Neurologists were the highest contributors to
   deutetrabenazine prescriptions (N = 50,017; 35.2%), and psychiatrists
   were the highest contributors to valbenazine prescriptions (N = 77,799;
   42.3%). A total of 1,217 deutetrabenazine physician prescribers (47.5%)
   and 1,509 valbenazine physician prescribers (49.7%) received industry
   payments from TEVA Pharmaceuticals and Neurocrine Biosciences,
   respectively. Receipt of industry payments was associated with higher
   prescription volume for both deutetrabenazine (p < 0.001) and
   valbenazine (p < 0.001). Approximately three-quarters of the industry
   payments were used in nonconsulting services, with a median payment
   value per physician of $18,101 for deutetrabenazine and $25,920 for
   valbenazine. Discussion The findings illustrate a yearly increase in
   Medicare prescription volume for deutetrabenazine and valbenazine after
   FDA approval, with neurologists and psychiatrists as primary prescribers
   of deutetrabenazine and valbenazine, respectively. There was a
   statistical difference in the prescription volume between those who
   received industry payments and those who did not, suggesting that
   receipt of payments may be associated with prescription volume.
   Nonconsulting services constituted the largest sum of industry payments
   for both medications. Further research exploring the causative factors
   of new medication uptake is needed to better understand how medications
   disseminate across the market.

AB Background and Objectives Few estimates of the long-term health system
   costs of Parkinson disease by phase of disease are available. We
   estimated 10-year and phase-based net health system costs of Parkinson
   disease before and after case ascertainment. Methods Using
   population-based linked administrative databases from Ontario, Canada,
   we identified 43,149 community-dwelling persons with incident Parkinson
   disease aged 40 years and older between 2009 and 2018 using a validated
   algorithm. These individuals were matched 1:1 to controls without
   Parkinson disease based on demographics and a propensity score. We
   calculated phase-based, net health system costs from the provincial
   government perspective during the preascertainment (3 years before
   index), initial (1 year after index), early continuing (>1-6 years after
   index), later continuing (>6-10 years after index), and terminal (1 year
   before death, if applicable) phases (standardized to 2020 $CAD and
   calculated on an annual basis). By applying survival probabilities to
   monthly cost estimates, we also determined 10-year net health system
   costs, stratified by sex and age. Results Annual mean net costs of
   Parkinson disease were lowest in the preascertainment phase ($212 CAD,
   95% CI [$20-$404]), intermediate in the initial phase ($4,576 (95% CI
   [$4,217-$4,935]), and higher in the early continuing phase ($7,078, 95%
   CI [$6,717-$7,438]). The later continuing phase ($12,500, 95% CI
   [$12,060-$12,940]) and the terminal phase ($13,933, 95% CI
   [$13,123-$14,743]) showed the highest costs. The 10-year net cost of
   Parkinson disease was $82,153 (95% CI [$77,965-$86,341]) and was
   significantly higher in women ($89,773, 95% CI [$83,306-$96,240]) than
   in men ($76,469, 95% CI [$70,983-$81,953]) and older individuals
   ($92,197, 95% CI [$87,087-$97,307]), compared with younger individuals
   ($62,580, 95% CI [$55,346-$69,814]). Over the 10-year period, hospital,
   nursing home, and home care were the largest contributors to costs of
   Parkinson disease. Discussion Health system costs of Parkinson disease
   are substantial, particularly in the later phases. Interventions to
   reduce avoidable use of hospital and nursing home services by persons
   living with Parkinson disease may provide better quality of life and be
   cost saving from the health system perspective.

AB Background and Objectives To characterize outpatient telemedicine
   utilization for neurologic conditions and identify potential
   disparities. Methods All outpatient visits conducted by neurology
   clinicians at an academic medical health care system for patients aged
   18 years or older from January 2019 to July 2022 were included. All
   telemedicine visits were synchronous audio-visual. Patients completing
   in-person visits alone were compared with patients completing
   telemedicine visits. Utilization of telemedicine was compared across 3
   time frames: prepandemic (before March 2020), early-pandemic (March-June
   2020), and late-pandemic (July 2020-July 2022). Generalized linear
   mixed-effects models were used to evaluate whether the odds of a visit
   being telemedicine vs in-person differed based on the time frame and to
   predict likelihood of telemedicine vs in-person visit in late pandemic
   time frame. Results In total, 242,273 patients (mean age 55.9 years,
   58.2% female, 81.9% White, 12.5% Black, 3.4% Hispanic, 39.2% Medicare)
   completed 752,174 visits during the study time frame. There was a
   significant difference in telemedicine utilization between the time
   frames, with the highest utilization being in the early pandemic (p
   0.01). In the late pandemic time frame, odds of a telemedicine visit
   were significantly lower for individuals who were older (odds ratio [OR]
   0.97), Black (OR 0.84), Hispanic (OR 0.70), a higher Area Deprivation
   Index (20%-40%: OR 0.85, 40%-60%: OR 0.80, 60%-80%: OR 0.78, >= 80%: OR
   0.65), with nonprivate insurance (Medicaid OR 0.78; Medicare OR 0.84;
   self-pay OR 0.60), and non-English preferred language (OR 0.61) (p <
   0.01 for all). Odds of a telemedicine visit were significantly higher
   for individuals who were female (OR 1.25) and lived outside of the
   greater Cleveland area (other Ohio OR 2.33; out of state OR 3.32) (p <
   0.01). Visits completed by rural patients did not differ significantly
   from metropolitan patients (OR 0.95, p = 0.09). Discussion Disparities
   in telemedicine persist with lower use in individuals who were older,
   Black, Hispanic, non-English preferred language, and lower socioeconomic
   status. These disparities improved initially but were accentuated later
   in the pandemic. The equal utilization of telemedicine by rural and
   urban patients in this study suggests the potential of telemedicine to
   improve access disparities for rural patients. The implementation of
   equitable health care delivery will require a better understanding of
   barriers, preferences, and legislation needed to support equitable
   telemedicine access.

AB Background and Objectives Despite decreasing prevalence of migraine with
   advancing age, there remains a significant proportion of individuals
   aged >= 65 years with migraine. Treatment of this population is
   difficult and they are often excluded from clinical trials, limiting
   evidence regarding migraine treatment outcomes. Our objective is to
   assess the efficacy and tolerability of anti-calcitonin gene-related
   peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies (erenumab,
   fremanezumab, and galcanezumab) in patients >= 65 years (O65) compared
   with patients <65 (U65) with daily or nondaily migraine. Methods This
   observational study uses retrospective data from the electronic medical
   records of patients who were treated with an anti-CGRP mAb between June
   2018 and November 2021. Efficacy was determined through a reduction in
   monthly migraine days (MMDs) and Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) scores
   from baseline to posttreatment. Tolerability was examined through the
   number of adverse events reported per group. Mann-Whitney tests were
   used to compare the efficacy and tolerability of U65 and O65 patients
   overall and separated into daily and nondaily migraine groups. Results
   The dataset consisted of U65 (n = 2,707; median [interquartile range];
   45.4 [35.8-53.8] years) or O65 (n = 304; 69.5 [67.3-73.3] years) and
   further separated into daily (n = 1,303) and nondaily (n = 1,708)
   migraine. There was no difference (p = 0.57) in the median MMD reduction
   between U65 (10 days [0.0-17.0]) and O65 (10 days [0.0-16.5]).
   Similarly, no difference was found among patients with nondaily migraine
   (p = 0.82) and patients with daily migraine (p = 0.59). HIT-6 scores
   decreased from severe to moderate/substantial impact for all groups. The
   daily and nondaily groups showed differences in meeting the 50%
   improvement threshold (nondaily U65, 67% vs daily U65, 54%, p < 0.0001;
   nondaily O65, 65% vs daily O65, 49%, p = 0.008). Side effects were
   reported (829/3,011), with a higher incidence in the U65 (22% O65, 28%
   U65). The most common side effects for both groups were injection site
   reaction/rash (40%) and constipation (25%). Discussion This
   retrospective analysis provides real-world evidence that there is no
   difference in the efficacy and tolerability of treatment with erenumab,
   fremanezumab, and galcanezumab in patients O65 when compared with
   patients U65 both with daily or nondaily migraine. These data may help
   guide the choice of migraine treatment in older populations.

AB Background and ObjectivesHeadache syndromes are highly prevalent,
   disabling, and costly. Our goals were to (1) describe headache care
   delivery and costs in a system and (2) identify opportunities for the
   system to collect, organize, or analyze health care data to facilitate
   value-based headache care delivery.MethodsWe performed a descriptive,
   retrospective cohort study using data from a large integrated health
   system (July 2018-July 2021). We assigned individuals into a reference
   (REF) or headache group based on headache-related ICD diagnoses. The
   primary exposure variable, applied to the headache group, was the
   headache specialty seen most after the incident headache diagnosis:
   primary care (PC), neurology (NEU), or headache subspecialist (HS).
   Outcomes of interest were per member per month all-cause costs, per
   episode costs, all-cause utilization, and headache utilization.
   Variables included age, sex, insurance contract, and the Adjusted
   Clinical Groups (ACG) concurrent risk score. We calculated univariate
   statistics for clinical indicators and outcomes for each group. For
   outcome variables, we also report these statistics after adjustment for
   ACG risk score.ResultsWe identified 22,700 (14%) individuals in the
   headache groups and 138,818 (86%) individuals in the reference group
   (REF). Within the headache groups, 84% received care from PC, 14% from
   NEU, and 2% from HS. The average ACG risk scores increased across
   exposure groups. In both unadjusted and after risk adjustment analyses,
   total cost of care (TCOC) was highest in NEU and HS, and the largest
   drivers of TCOC were outpatient facility costs, followed by inpatient
   facility costs. HS had the highest pharmacy and professional costs.
   After risk adjustment, all-cause inpatient admissions and
   headache-related ED visits were roughly similar, although there was
   increasing use of outpatient PC and NEU visits across exposure
   groups.DiscussionIndividuals seen by a NEU or HS had higher medical
   morbidity, higher health care utilization, and higher costs than those
   who receive care from PC. Outcome data were either not available or not
   structured to determine the value of neurologic expertise in headache
   care or within a particular headache care pathway. To clarify
   neurology's value in primary headache disorders, we encourage health
   system leaders to adopt an economic evaluation framework.

AB Introduction: Although treatment advances have improved survival rates
   for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC), patient expressed
   needs have not been evaluated in Ireland to date. Methods: A 76 item
   questionnaire was designed by the lead author and a cohort of 41 other
   MBC patients in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team. The online
   survey was publicised nationally on all media platforms. Results: 246
   patients completed the survey between July and October 2023. Most
   patients were satisfied with the manner of disclosure of their diagnosis
   but 77 % wanted more prognostic information. Disparate information
   sources were used to provide support. Only 35 % of patients had access
   to their records, yet 99 % of patients without access desired to have
   it. The majority (83 %) of patients were amenable to earlier palliative
   care referral. The symptom burden of respondents was high, 87 %
   experienced mental health issues and 68 % of those with menopausal
   symptoms were dissatisfied with the support. These burdens were
   compounded by financial stress with 20 % of patient unable to meet
   monthly expenses and by time toxicity with 25 % attending emergency
   departments in the previous 6 months. Conclusion: Currently the needs of
   MBC patients in Ireland and Northern Ireland have many unmet needs. The
   routine early provision of palliative care, psycho-oncology, medical
   social worker and dedicated liaison nurse supports guided by national
   guidelines and education for healthcare professionals, integrated with
   living well with cancer clinics and a dedicated medically verified
   website would provide an ecosystem where MBC care could be optimised for
   patients and their families.

AB Rectal adenocarcinoma is a common malignant tumor of the digestive
   tract. However, it is difficult to obtain tumor microstructural
   information using conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Dynamic
   contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) have
   been used in tumor research. The present study aimed to explore the
   application of DCE-MRI and IVIM in the risk stratification of resectable
   rectal adenocarcinoma. To achieve this, 75 patients with rectal
   adenocarcinoma confirmed via postoperative pathological examination who
   underwent high-resolution MRI, IVIM and DCE-diffusion-weighted imaging
   before surgery were retrospectively enrolled and divided into very
   low-risk (19 cases), low-risk (29 cases) and medium-risk (27 cases)
   groups. The quantitative parameters of DCE-MRI and IVIM were obtained
   using the GenIQ and Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit software,
   respectively. One-way analysis of variance or the Kruskal-Wallis H test
   were used to analyze the differences in the measured parameters between
   the different risk groups. Receiver operating characteristic curves were
   used to analyze the diagnostic efficacy of each parameter. The
   differences in rate constant (K-ep), perfusion fraction (f) and false
   diffusion coefficient (D*) between the different risk stratification
   groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). When the very low- and
   low-risk groups were compared, f + D* had the highest diagnostic
   efficiency [area under the curve (AUC)=0.719], with a sensitivity and
   specificity of 100 and 51.70%, respectively. When the low- and
   medium-risk groups were compared, K-ep had the highest diagnostic
   efficiency (AUC=0.602), with a sensitivity and specificity of 72.41 and
   55.56%, respectively. When the very low-risk and medium-risk groups were
   compared, K-ep + f + D* had the highest diagnostic efficiency
   (AUC=0.887), with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 70.4%,
   respectively. Thus, DCE-MRI and IVIM can aid the prognostic risk
   stratification of resectable rectal adenocarcinoma, and K-ep, f and D*
   are potential quantitative imaging parameters for the risk
   stratification of rectal adenocarcinoma.

AB The 15-minute community life circle (15-min CLC) concept focuses on
   providing accessible services for older adults within a short walking
   distance. However, few studies have developed a comprehensive evaluation
   system of 15-min CLC walking accessibility for older people, and little
   is known about the effects of street-level environment characteristics
   and human perception on 15-min CLC. This study used the Baidu API and an
   optimized cumulative opportunity method to measure the 5-, 10-, and
   15-min CLC walkability for older adults in Suzhou, China. Street-level
   characteristics and human perception scores, derived from street view
   semantic segmentation and deep learning, were incorporated into
   regression models to assess global and local effects on walkability. The
   results revealed that there was a significant spatial heterogeneity of
   CLC walkability in Suzhou. The 5- and 10- min CLCs were found lacking in
   facilities, particularly senior care services. The regression model
   showed a positive association between perceived safety and CLC
   walkability, while the proportion of street vegetation negatively
   affected walkability. The study suggests enhancing senior care, medical,
   and leisure facilities, especially within 10-min CLCs. Improving service
   integration in county-level cities and suburbs, and increasing street
   vegetation in older urban areas, could further enhance the walking
   environment for older adults.

AB Introduction: Heart disease poses a significant health and economic
   burden in the U.S., with considerable variations in outcomes across
   different racial and ethnic groups. The COVID-19 pandemic has further
   highlighted the disparities in healthcare utilization and costs
   associated with heart disease.
   Methods: The authors used the 2021 Merative MarketScan Medicaid claims
   database to estimate the medical costs and healthcare utilization
   associated with heart disease by racial and ethnic groups and COVID-19
   diagnosis status. This study focused on individuals aged ≥18 years
   continuously enrolled in a noncapitated insurance plan in 2021. The
   outcome measures included total medical expenditures and healthcare
   utilization, including the numbers of emergency department visits and
   inpatient admissions and length of inpatient stay. The authors employed
   a generalized linear model with a family of gamma and log links for
   medical costs, and a negative binomial regression was used for
   healthcare utilization. Three-way interactions of heart disease,
   COVID-19 diagnosis, and race and ethnicity categories were implemented
   after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. The authors reported
   average marginal effects with 95% CIs.
   Results: Among 1,008,166 Medicaid beneficiaries, 8% had heart disease in
   2021. The cost associated with heart disease was $10,819 per beneficiary
   in 2021 (95% CI=10,292; 11,347; p<0.001). The cost was $15,840 (95%
   CI=14,389; 17,291; p<0.001) for non-Hispanic Black individuals; $9,945
   (95% CI=9,172; 10,718; p<0.001) for non-Hispanic White; and $8,511 (95%
   CI=7,490; 9,531; p<0.001) for Hispanic individuals. Individuals with a
   COVID-19 diagnosis ($19,638) had $9,541 (95% CI=7,049; 12,032; p<0.001)
   higher costs associated with heart disease than those without COVID-19
   ($10,098) (p<0.001). Individuals with heart disease had higher numbers
   of emergency department visits (0.937 per beneficiary, 95% CI=0.913;
   0.960), inpatient admissions (0.463 per beneficiary, 95% CI=0.455;
   0.471), and average length of stay (2.541 days per admission, 95%
   CI=2.405; 2.677) than those without heart disease.
   Conclusions: The study's findings showed that costs and healthcare
   utilization associated with heart disease are substantial in all racial
   and ethnic groups and the highest among non-Hispanic Black individuals.
   Furthermore, individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis had approximately 2
   times higher costs associated with heart disease than individuals
   without a COVID-19 diagnosis.

AB center dot PURPOSE: To discuss the history and current state of private
   equity in ophthalmology, and to explore potential implications for
   ophthalmology practices, physicians, and patients. center dot DESIGN:
   Perspective. center dot METHODS: Selected articles in ophthalmology and
   non- ophthalmology medical literature were reviewed, and commentary is
   provided based on the authors' experiences. center dot RESULTS:
   Investment in ophthalmology appeals to private equity firms because of
   high procedural volumes, fragmented private practices, opportunities for
   real estate ownership, and an aging population in need of eye care. As a
   result, acquisition of private practices by large private equity
   companies has swelled since 2015. Metropolitan areas and practices that
   possess ambulatory surgical centers or a high proportion of retina
   surgeons receive the greatest investment. However, little objective data
   exist regarding the benefits of this trend. Initial research suggests
   that private equity ownership may have a negative impact on patient care
   through greater costs, shorter appointments, and fewer Medicare/Medicaid
   patients seen. Skeptics of private equity also highlight concerns that
   include financial risk falling primarily on the acquired practice
   itself, a short-term business approach that rewards profit maximization,
   and the erosion of physician autonomy. Furthermore, young
   ophthalmologists express reservations about working for private equity
   firms. In all, 78% of trainees indicated that they would not consider
   employment by a private equity-owned practice, and 81.4% of
   vitreoretinal fellows voiced concerns about autonomy and job security.
   Proposed legislation aimed at limiting private equity acquisitions is
   currently under review at the statewide level, adding additional
   uncertainty to the future of private equity involvement in
   ophthalmology. center dot CONCLUSIONS: Although investment by private
   equity offers potential financial rewards and operational improvements
   for practices, it also raises significant concerns reminiscent of those
   experienced by physician practice management companies in the 1990s .
   Non-anecdotal data are needed to assess the benefits and future of
   private equity involvement in ophthalmology. (Am J Ophthalmol 2025;270:

   an UACI of 33.54%, an NPCR of 99.6%, and negative correlation
   coefficient values. The proposed scheme effectively decrypted tampered
   images, successfully recovering the maximum amount of information, as
   evidenced by tests with 50% data occlusion from encrypted images. These
   results emphasize the superior reliability, feasibility, and efficiency
   of the proposed quantum encryption protocol in securing medical image
   data during transmission and storage.

AB In today's rapidly advancing medical landscape, the integration of
   information from multiple imaging modalities, known as medical fusion,
   stands at the forefront of diagnostic innovation. This approach combines
   the strengths of diverse techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), and
   single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to offer a more
   comprehensive view of a patient's condition. Issues such as data
   heterogeneity, where varied resolutions and contrasts must be
   harmonized, complicate the seamless integration of imaging data. The
   complexity of interpreting fused images demands specialized training for
   clinicians and raises concerns about potential diagnostic errors. This
   work presents the deep adaptive fusion (Deep-AF) model for image fusion
   in multimodal biomedical scans includes MRI, CT, PET, and SPECT. This
   Deep-AF model integrates convolutional neural network (CNN)-based
   decision maps, deep sparse coding, cross-modality feature transition,
   and fusion techniques. Three pre-processing steps, including intensity
   normalization, noise reduction, and spatial registration, are initially
   applied to enhance alignment and quality in fused images. Non-subsampled
   contourlet thresholding (NSCTT) is employed to address challenges
   related to intensity, resolution, and contrast differences among
   modalities, facilitating multi-scale and multidirectional
   representation. Despite challenges in spatial alignment, interpretation
   across modalities, and model generalization, the proposed
   gradient-weighted class activation mapping with CNN (GradCAM-CNN)
   enhances interpretability by visualizing crucial regions for CNN
   predictions. Deep sparse coding fusion (DSCF) overcomes challenges
   through the adaptive learning of complex features, capturing high-level
   features while enforcing sparsity. The cross-modality feature transition
   mechanism (CMFTM) addresses variations in modality characteristics. The
   attention weighted averaging network (AtWANet) addresses challenges in
   multimodal feature fusion by dynamically assigning weights based on
   relevance, providing a flexible approach despite misalignment and scale
   variations. AtWANet's model training optimizes the fusion process by
   dynamically assigning attention weights to each modality, ensuring
   effective integration of varied representations. Simulation results
   obtains that the proposed Deep-AF model obtains robust fusion results in
   terms of statistical and accuracy metrics.

AB OBJECTIVES: Estimates of life expectancy can inform clinical
   recommendations and decisions for older adults, but many clinicians find
   it difficult to discuss. We interviewed primary care clinicians to
   identify best practices for discussing life expectancy with older
   adults.
   METHODS: Twenty-one primary care clinicians (Internal Medicine, Family
   Medicine, and Geriatrics) completed in-depth interviews on Zoom or by
   telephone. Topics included estimation and discussion of life expectancy
   with older patients to guide cancer screening and preventive care
   decisions. We transcribed, coded, and inductively analyzed interviews
   using a thematic analysis approach.
   RESULTS: Most clinicians recommended individualizing communication about
   life expectancy versus a standardized approach. Although many clinicians
   worry that conversations about life expectancy won't go well, successful
   conversations are possible when clinicians bring humility, care, and
   attention to these interactions. Clinicians identified seven steps that
   they find effective for deciding if, when, and how to discuss life
   expectancy with older patients and detailed tips for using these steps
   in practice.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians can take multiple steps to optimize
   conversations about life expectancy to personalize medical decision
   making.
   PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The tips and language presented provide a helpful
   starting point for clinicians to have conversations about life
   expectancy and appropriate care with older adults.

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a critical health issue worldwide and is very
   treatable if diagnosed on time. This paper proposes an innovative CADx
   system, namely CRCFusionAICADx, that enhances the efficiency of
   diagnosis by fusing CNNs with LSTM networks and feature integration
   techniques. Using data from the CKHK-22 colonoscopy image dataset, we
   preprocess the images into grayscale first and then apply LBP analysis
   for emphasizing textural features. These are further analyzed using
   three different pre-trained CNN models: VGG16, DenseNet-201, and
   ResNet50. These were chosen because of their complementary feature
   extraction capabilities. The resultant features from grayscale, LBP, and
   raw images will be fused to create an integrated dataset. To increase
   variability in the dataset and reduce overfitting for the network, we
   decided to apply a series of data augmentation techniques, which
   included zooming in, rotation, and horizontal flipping. By doing so, we
   expanded the dataset into 57,148 images. This augmented dataset is then
   used to train a model, RDV-22, which includes an integration of the
   architectures of VGG16, DenseNet-201, and ResNet50, with CNN and CNN +
   LSTM layers. The LSTM network learns the temporal dependencies of frames
   in a sequence and hence allows for more sensitive and specific detection
   of CRC. CRCFusionAICADx produces very impressive results, where the
   RDV-22 model produces a testing accuracy of 90.81%, precision of 91.00%,
   recall of 90.00%, and an F1 score of 90.49% in its results. This gives
   the model an ROC AUC of 0.98, reflecting very strong discriminatory
   power. This integrative approach thus shows tremendous promise for early
   CRC detection by offering a strong diagnostic tool that integrates both
   spatial and temporal features into a new standard in clinical
   diagnostics.

AB The concept of emissivity has been with the scientific and engineering
   world since Planck formulated his blackbody radiation law more than a
   century ago. Nevertheless, emissivity is an elusive concept even for
   experts. It is a vague and fuzzy concept for the wider community of
   engineers. The importance of remote sensing of temperature by measuring
   IR radiation has been recognized in a wide range of industrial, medical,
   and environmental uses. One of the major sources of errors in IR
   radiometry is the emissivity of the surface being measured. In real
   experiments, emissivity may be influenced by many factors: surface
   texture, spectral properties, oxidation, and aging of surfaces. While
   commercial blackbodies are prevalent, the much-needed grey bodies with a
   known emissivity, are unavailable. This study describes how to achieve a
   calibrated and stable emissivity with a blackbody, a perforated screen,
   and a reliable and linear novel IR thermal sensor, 18 dubbed TMOS. The
   Digital TMOS is now a low-cost commercial product, it requires low
   power, and it has a small form factor. The methodology is based on
   two-color measurements, with two different optical filters, with
   selected wavelengths conforming to the grey body definition of the use
   case under study. With a photochemically etched perforated screen, the
   effective emissivity of the screen is simply the hole density area of
   the surface area that emits according to the blackbody temperature
   radiation. The concept is illustrated with ray tracing simulations,
   which demonstrate the approach. Measured results are reported.

AB Objective: In 2016, a selective preventive spinal immobilization
   protocol for emergency medical service (EMS) nurses was introduced in
   the Netherlands. This protocol leaves more room for autonomous
   decision-making in the pre-hospital phase regarding preventive spinal
   immobilization (PSI), compared to the previous strict protocol. In this
   study, we explored the experiences and perspectives of EMS nurses on
   decisionmaking about PSI after the change from a strict to a selective
   PSI protocol. Methods: We used a qualitative design with semistructured
   face-to-face interviews. Thematic analysis was applied. The
   capability-opportunity-motivationbehavior-model was used to interpret
   the experiences and perspectives. Results: Thirteen EMS nurses from
   three emergency medical services were interviewed. Respondents
   appreciated autonomous decision-making as there was more room for
   patient-centered informed decision-making. However, autonomous
   decision-making required optimized knowledge and skills and elicited the
   need to receive feedback on their decision not to apply PSI. When nurses
   anticipated resistance to selective PSI from receiving hospitals, they
   were doubtful to apply it. Conclusion: Nurses appreciate the increased
   autonomy in decision-making, encouraging them to focus on
   patient-centered care. Increased autonomy also places higher demands on
   knowledge and skills, calling for training and feedback. Anticipated
   resistance to receiving hospitals based on mutual protocol discrepancies
   could lead to PSI application by EMS nurses while not deemed necessary.
   Recommendations: To enhance PSI procedures, optimizing the knowledge and
   skills of EMS nurses that facilitate on-scene decision-making may be
   indicated. A learning loop for feedback between the EMS nurses and the
   involved hospitals may add to their professional performance. More
   efforts are needed to create support for the changed Emergency Medical
   Services strategy in PSI to prevent unnecessary PSI and practice
   variation.

   well known, are now available to patients to seek medical advice in
   various languages. However, the accuracy of the information utilized to
   train these models remains unknown. Methods: Ten commonly asked
   questions regarding labor epidurals were translated from English to
   Spanish, and all 20 questions were entered into ChatGPT version 3.5. The
   answers were transcribed. A survey was then sent to 10 bilingual
   fellowship-trained obstetric anesthesiologists to assess the accuracy of

   accuracy scores for the ChatGPT-generated answers in Spanish were lower
   than for the English answers with a median score of 34 (IQR 33-36.5)
   versus 40.5 (IQR 39-44.3), respectively (P value 0.02). Answers to two
   questions were scored significantly lower: "Do epidurals prolong labor?"
   (2 (IQR 2-2.5) versus 4 (IQR 4-4.5), P value 0.03) and "Do epidurals
   increase the risk of needing cesarean delivery?" (3(IQR 2-4) versus 4
   (IQR 4-5); P value 0.03). There was a strong agreement that answers to
   the question "Do epidurals cause autism" were accurate in both Spanish
   and English. Conclusion: ChatGPT-generated answers in Spanish to ten
   questions about labor epidurals scored lower for accuracy than answers
   generated in English, particularly regarding the effect of labor
   epidurals on labor course and mode of delivery. This disparity in
   ChatGPT-generated information may extend already-known health inequities

AB The growing burden of cancer, with its costly and difficult to endure
   therapies, underscores the urgent need for individualized care that
   enhances patients' quality of life. Effective individualized treatment
   planning requires collaboration between healthcare professionals and
   patients (and their relatives), focusing on patients' personal values
   and preferences through shared decision-making. In practice, oncology
   care predominantly follows clinical guidelines, which, while reducing
   practice variation, may not account for individual patient differences
   in health status and preferences. Moreover, guidelines often emphasize
   medical endpoints such as disease-free survival, overlooking quality of
   life and treatment burden considerations crucial to many patients. This
   can result in unfitting treatment choices and decisional regret. The
   Integrated Oncological Decision-making Model (IODM) addresses these
   challenges by incorporating three essential domains for treatment
   decision-making: medical treatment options, patient goals and
   preferences, and general health status. The IODM aims to integrate these
   domains into the decision-making process, ensuring that treatment plans
   are tailored to individual patient needs. Initial implementation of the
   IODM is shown promising results, with a significant proportion of
   patients receiving less invasive, more appropriate treatments without
   compromising survival outcomes. The IODM has demonstrated its potential
   to facilitate patient-centred care, reduce unnecessary treatments, and
   improve patient outcomes. Continued implementation and evaluation of the
   IODM across various oncological settings are essential to refine the
   model and ensure its integration into routine clinical practice,
   ultimately enhancing the quality and effectiveness of cancer care.

AB Introduction: People who use substances increasingly access healthcare
   primarily through emergency medical services (EMS) and emergency
   departments (EDs). To meet the needs of these patients, EMS and EDs have
   become access points for medications for opioid use disorder (OUD),
   specifically buprenorphine. This systematic review aimed to quantify the
   efficacy of these programs, examining retention in treatment for OUD,
   rates of representation to ED or EMS, and rates of precipitated
   withdrawal, as well as summarise clinician and patient perspectives on
   buprenorphine initiation in these settings. Methods: This review
   considered studies including patients with OUD receiving, and providers
   initiating, buprenorphine in an ED or EMS setting. A convergent,
   segregated approach to mixed-methods review was used as recommended by
   the Joanna Briggs Institute. A search was conducted of MEDLINE, CINAHL,
   EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Where relevant, meta-analyses of odds
   ratios and proportions were conducted. Findings: In both randomised (OR
   5.97, 95 %CI 2.52-14.14, 227 participants, I2 16.93 %) and observational
   (OR 4.28, 95 %CI 2.45-7.48, 779 participants, I2 66.97 %) research,
   buprenorphine in the ED or EMS setting was associated with increased
   odds of treatment engagement at 30 days. Rates of retention in treatment
   varied across measured time points, from 77 % (95 %CI 74-80 %, 763
   participants, I2 0.01 %) within 24 h, to 35 % (95 %CI 29-40 %) at 12
   months. A low rate of precipitated withdrawal was reported (0.00 %, 95
   %CI 0.00-1.00 %, 851 participants, I2 0.00 %). Clinicians and patients
   were generally supportive of ED-initiated buprenorphine, while
   identifying the initiation buprenorphine as one component of a
   longitudinal care path for people with OUD. Patients valued clinicians
   engaging in shared decision-making, while clinicians identified the
   environment of the ED often made this challenging. Conclusion: The
   initiation of buprenorphine in the ED setting is associated with higher
   odds of short and mediumterm treatment engagement. Further research is
   required into EMS-initiated buprenorphine, as well as patient
   perspectives of ED- and EMS-initiated buprenorphine. (c) 2024 The

AB The yolk sac is phylogenetically the oldest of the extra-embryonic
   membranes and plays important roles in nutrient transfer during early
   pregnancy in many species. In the human this function is considered
   largely vestigial, in part because the secondary yolk sac never makes
   contact with the inner surface of the chorionic sac. Instead, it is
   separated from the chorion by the fluid-filled extra-embryonic coelom
   and attached to the developing embryo by a relatively long vitelline
   duct. The coelomic fluid is, however, rich in nutrients and key
   cofactors, including folic acid and anti-oxidants, derived from maternal
   plasma and the endometrial glands. Bulk sequencing has recently revealed
   the presence of transcripts encoding numerous transporter proteins for
   these ligands. Mounting evidence suggests the human secondary yolk sac
   plays a pivotal role in the transfer of histotrophic nutrition during
   the critical phase of organogenesis but also of chemicals such as
   medical drugs and cotinine. We therefore propose that the early
   placental villi, coelomic cavity and yolk sac combine to function
   physiologically as a choriovitelline placenta during the first weeks of
   pregnancy. We have derived organoids from the mouse yolk sac as
   proof-of-principle of a model system that could be used to answer many
   questions concerning the functional capacity of the human yolk sac as a
   maternal-fetal exchange interface during the first trimester of
   pregnancy.

AB In the field of medical imaging, the automatic detection and
   segmentation of colon polyps is crucial for the early diagnosis of
   colorectal cancer. Currently, Transformer methods are commonly employed
   for colon polyp segmentation tasks, often utilizing dual attention
   mechanisms. However, these attention mechanisms typically utilize
   channel attention and spatial attention in a serial or parallel manner,
   which increases computational costs and model complexity. To address
   these issues, we propose a Shared Hybrid Attention Transformer (SHAT)
   framework, which shares queries and keys, thereby avoiding redundant
   computations and reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we
   introduce differential subtraction attention module to enhance feature
   fusion capability and significantly improve the delineation of polyp
   boundaries, effectively capture complex image details and edge
   information involved in the colon polyp images comparing with existing
   techniques. Our approach overcomes the limitations of existing colon
   polyp segmentation techniques. Experimental results on a large-scale
   annotated colon polyp image dataset demonstrate that our method excels
   in localizing and segmenting polyps of various sizes, shapes, and
   textures with high robustness. The source code for the SHAT framework is
   available at https://github.com/peanutHao/SHAT.

AB Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) detection and analysis techniques are
   critical for understanding their emissions, transport, and impacts.
   Proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) is one of the most
   widely used methods for real-time monitoring VOCs emissions due to its
   high time resolution and low detection limits. Quantification of VOCs
   measurement data must be reliable to ensure data comparability, which
   heavily depends on measurement uncertainty. In this review, the
   definition of measurement uncertainty and its importance in VOCs
   measurements are present. Then, the sources of VOCs measurement
   uncertainty are discussed, and corresponding methods to reduce it are
   analyzed. Furthermore, several important innovations in PTR-MS
   calibration are detailed. These calibration innovations have enhanced
   the accuracy and efficiency of PTR-MS measurements. This review presents
   a recent calibration approach developed by the National Physics
   Laboratory (NPL) and the University of Utrecht, considered the most
   pragmatic for addressing PTR-MS measurement accuracy and comparability.
   Finally, perspectives for the PTR-MS are suggested: Technologies, such
   as electronics, optics, chemistry, mechanics, and so on, are anticipated
   to enhance PTR-MS systems, reduce costs, and increase their popularity.

AB The early-life gut microbiota (GM) is increasingly recognized for its
   contributions to human health and disease over time. Microbiota
   composition, influenced by factors like race, geography, lifestyle, and
   individual differences, is subject to change. The GM serves dual roles,
   defending against pathogens and shaping the host immune system.
   Disruptions in microbial composition can lead to immune dysregulation,
   impacting defense mechanisms. Additionally, GM aids digestion, releasing
   nutrients and influencing physiological systems like the liver, brain,
   and endocrine system through microbial metabolites. Dysbiosis disrupts
   intestinal homeostasis, contributing to age-related diseases. Recent
   studies are elucidating the bacterial species that characterize a
   healthy microbiota, defining what constitutes a 'healthy' colonic
   microbiota. The present review article focuses on the importance of
   microbiome composition for the development of homeostasis and the roles
   of GM during aging and the age-related diseases caused by the alteration
   in gut microbial communities. This article might also help the readers
   to find treatments targeting GM for the prevention of various diseases
   linked to it effectively.

AB Background: Healthcare facilities remain at risk of Coronavirus Disease
   2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks. Proactive surveillance strategies can
   potentially mitigate the risk of these outbreaks. Objective: To
   determine whether results from the environmental detection of Severe
   Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from floor swabs
   could be provided to the Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) team in
   near real-time. Methods: We conducted a 9-week prospective study at a
   rehabilitation hospital in Toronto, Canada. Beginning in October 2023,
   we swabbed the hallways and adjoining areas of one of the floors of the
   hospital. This floor consisted of two separate units: the Medical Rehab
   Unit and the Transitional Care Unit, each accommodating 32 patients.
   Swabs were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 by quantitative reverse-transcriptase
   polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results from the floor swabs,
   including percentage positivity for SARS-CoV-2 and number of viral RNA
   copies, were sent to the hospital's infection control team twice-weekly.
   Number of patients with COVID-19, confirmed and suspected COVID-19
   outbreaks, and acute transfers to another hospital were recorded over
   the study duration. Results: A total of 465 swabs were collected, and
   232 (50%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The turnaround time from floor
   swabbing to the results being provided to IPAC ranged from 1-6 days with
   an average turnaround time of 1.9 days (interquartile range: 1 to 2
   days). Swab positivity in the Medical Rehab Unit (65%, 95% CI: 58-71%)
   was significantly greater than the Transitional Care Unit (38%, 95% CI:
   32-44%). During the study period there were 4 patients diagnosed with
   COVID-19 on the Medical Rehab Unit and none on the Transitional Care
   Unit. There was one suspected COVID-19 outbreak on the Medical Rehab
   Unit: three COVID-19 cases were identified within six days; all patients
   on the unit were tested for COVID-19; no further cases were identified
   and no outbreak was declared. During the suspected outbreak, the
   percentage of floor swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 peaked, at 100% in the
   Medical Rehab Unit. Conclusion: Floor swabs were provided to IPAC in
   almost real-time; however, delays in shipments in some instances led to
   delays in the results being made available. Larger studies over an
   extended timeframe are needed to better understand whether environmental
   surveillance can aid IPAC decision-making.

AB The complex interplay of epigenetic factors is essential in regulating
   the hallmarks of cancer and orchestrating intricate molecular
   interactions during tumor progression. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), known
   for their covalently closed loop structures, are non-coding RNA
   molecules exceptionally resistant to enzymatic degradation, which
   enhances their stability and regulatory functions in cancer. Similarly,
   microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous noncoding RNAs with linear structures
   that regulate cellular biological processes akin to circRNAs. Both
   miRNAs and circRNAs exhibit aberrant expressions in various cancers.
   Notably, circRNAs can function as sponges for miRNAs, influencing their
   activity. The circRNA/miRNA interaction plays a pivotal role in the
   regulation of cancer progression, including in brain, gastrointestinal,
   gynecological, and urological cancers, influencing key processes such as
   proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal
   transition (EMT), and more. Additionally, this interaction impacts the
   response of tumor cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy and contributes
   to immune evasion, a significant challenge in cancer therapy. Both
   circRNAs and miRNAs hold potential as biomarkers for cancer prognosis
   and diagnosis. In this review, we delve into the circRNA-miRNA circuit
   within human cancers, emphasizing their role in regulating cancer
   hallmarks and treatment responses. This discussion aims to provide
   insights for future research to better understand their functions and
   potentially guide targeted treatments for cancer patients using
   circRNA/miRNA-based strategies.

AB Following the initial treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), tumor
   progression often portends an adverse prognosis for these patients.
   MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of tumor
   immunity, yet their intricate mechanisms in NPC remain elusive. Through
   comprehensive miRNA sequencing, tumor tissue microarrays and tissue
   samples analysis, we identified miR-142-3p as a significantly
   upregulated miRNA that is strongly associated with poor prognosis in
   recurrent NPC patients. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism,
   we employed RNA sequencing, coupled with cellular and tissue assays, to
   identify the downstream targets and associated signaling pathways of
   miR-142-3p. Our findings revealed two potential targets, CFL2 and WASL,
   which are directly targeted by miR-142-3p. Functionally, overexpressing
   CFL2 or WASL significantly reversed the malignant phenotypes induced by
   miR-142-3p both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, signaling pathway
   analysis revealed that miR-142-3p repressed the RIG-I-mediated immune
   defense response in NPC by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of IRF3,
   IRF7 and p65. Moreover, we discovered that ADAR1 physically interacted
   with Dicer and promoted the formation of mature miR-142-3p in a
   dose-dependent manner. Collectively, ADAR1-mediated miR-142-3p
   processing promotes tumor progression and suppresses antitumor immunity,
   indicating that miR-142-3p may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker
   and therapeutic target for NPC patients.

AB Background: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is one of the
   important causes of lower back pain, seriously affecting people's health
   and quality of life. This research employs single-cell analysis to
   identify the specific cellular subtypes and key regulatory genes
   associated with IVDD. Methods: We analyzed the single-cell data and
   screened cells that closely associated with the development of IVDD. The
   differential expression of feature genes between IVDD and control groups
   was analyzed. Additionally, drugs and regulatory transcription factors
   that interact with feature genes were predicted and clinically validated
   by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR),
   immunohistochemistry (IHC), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
   (ELISA). Results: Our study identified the Chond2 cell subtype
   associated with IVDD and selected four feature genes influencing the
   development of IVDD, namely IGFBP3, ACAN, VAPA and TMEM45A, through the
   highdimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA)
   analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and
   random forest (RF). Besides, compared to the MDD group, IGFBP3 and
   TMEM45A were significantly upregulated in the SDD group, while ACAN and
   VAPA showed no significant difference between the two groups. ELISA
   testing revealed a positive correlation between IGFBP3 concentration and
   the grading of IVDD. Furthermore, Celecoxib may be used to treat IVDD by
   inhibiting IGFBP3. Conclusion: Our study identified the Chond2 cell
   subtype associated with IVDD and selected four feature genes influencing
   the development of IVDD, namely IGFBP3, ACAN, VAPA and TMEM45A. Our
   findings establish a robust theoretical foundation for the clinical
   diagnosis and treatment of IVDD patients.

AB Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are widely recognized as a leading cause
   of death worldwide; however, early diagnosis and disease progression
   monitoring play a crucial role in their clinical management. The common
   diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers have represented a revolutionary
   tool for studying CVD; however, their applications are limited to
   invasive irreversible heart diseases, such as drug-induced myocardial
   injury. In light of this information, a growing number of studies are
   currently investigating the diagnostic and prognostic potential of novel
   CVD biomarkers. Examples of this are long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and
   other RNAs that are specifically expressed at the early stages of heart
   disease. These RNAs have been reported to be involved in the development
   of CVD via activating or inhibiting inflammatory mediators and
   angiogenesis-related factors, as well as endothelial cell proliferation,
   migration and phenotypic transformation. This review collectively
   summarizes the recent studies' results concerning exosomal lncRNA
   biogenesis, characterization, and function, as well as its role as a

   highlights the urgent necessity for noninvasive biomarkers to detect
   these conditions early. To address this, we endeavored to construct a
   diagnostic model for MASLD/MASH using a combination of bioinformatics,
   molecular/biochemical data, and machine learning techniques. Initially,
   bioinformatics analysis was employed to identify RNA molecules
   associated with MASLD/MASH pathogenesis and enriched in ferroptosis and
   exophagy. This analysis unveiled specific networks related to
   ferroptosis (GPX4, LPCAT3, ACSL4, miR-4266, and LINC00442) and exophagy
   (TSG101, HGS, SNF8, miR-4498, miR-5189-5p, and CTBP1-AS2). Subsequently,
   serum samples from 400 participants (151 healthy, 150 MASH, and 99
   MASLD) underwent biochemical and molecular analysis, revealing
   significant dyslipidemia, impaired liver function, and disrupted
   glycemic indicators in MASLD/MASH patients compared to healthy controls.
   Molecular analysis indicated increased expression of LPCAT3, ACSL4,
   TSG101, HGS, and SNF8, alongside decreased GPX4 levels in MASH and MASLD
   patients compared to controls. The expression of epigenetic regulators
   from both networks (miR-4498, miR-5189-5p, miR-4266, LINC00442, and
   CTBP1-AS2) significantly differed among the studied groups. Finally,
   supervised machine learning models, including Neural Networks and Random
   Forest, were applied to molecular signatures and clinical/biochemical
   data. The Random Forest model exhibited superior performance, and
   molecular features effectively distinguished between the three studied
   groups. Clinical features, particularly BMI, consistently served as
   discriminatory factors, while biochemical features exhibited varying
   discriminant behavior across MASH, MASLD, and control groups. Our study
   underscores the significant potential of integrating diverse data types
   to enable early detection of MASLD/MASH, offering a promising approach
   for non-invasive diagnostic strategies.

AB Background: Anomalies in healthcare refer to deviation from the norm of
   unusual or unexpected patterns or activities related to patients,
   diseases or medical centres. Detecting these anomalies is crucial for
   timely interventions and efficient decision-making, helping to identify
   issues like operational inefficiencies, fraud and emerging health
   complications. Objectives: This study presents a novel method for
   detecting both collective and individual anomalies in healthcare data
   through time series analysis using unsupervised machine learning. The
   dual-strategy approach leverages two methodologies: a 'practice
   centre-based approach' which monitors changes across different practice
   centres and a 'process-based approach' which focuses on identifying
   anomalies within individual centres. The former allows for early
   detection of systemic issues, while the latter highlights specific
   irregularities within a centre's operations. Methods: The study utilised
   a dataset over 500,000 medical records from multiple GP practice centres
   in the UK collected between 2018-2023. Data are clustered using DBSCAN
   to identify collective anomalies from deviations from linear trends in
   consecutive two-month scatterplots. Individual anomalies are identified
   by examining the SOM-clustered time series of various medical processes
   within a specific practice centre, where graphs show deviation from the
   typical pattern. Findings: Our approach addresses some challenges posed
   by the complexity and sensitivity of healthcare data by not requiring
   personal information. The method offers accurate visual representations
   making the data accessible and interpretable for non-technical users.
   Unlike traditional methods focusing solely on subsequence anomalies, our
   technique analyses the collective behaviour across multiple time series
   providing a more comprehensive perspective. Conclusion: This study
   underscores the importance of integrating unsupervised anomaly detection
   with clinical expertise to ensure that statistically anomalous patterns
   align with clinical relevance. The dual-strategy clustering method holds
   significant potential for enabling timely interventions, proactively
   identifying potential crises, and ultimately contributing to better
   decision-making and operational efficiency within the healthcare sector.

AB Concussion is a common mild traumatic brain injury affecting athletic,
   military, and general populations. While unrestricted medical clearance
   often occurs within 1month, emerging evidence indicates prolonged
   sensorimotor control deficiencies and greater musculoskeletal injury
   risk after a concussion. Various theoretical frameworks and original
   studies indicate potential neurophysiological alterations affecting
   sensory input, sensorimotor integration, and neuromotor output, though
   the exact mechanisms remain unclear. This commentary aims to briefly
   review the literature on contributors to sensory and neuromotor
   deficiencies potentially related to musculoskeletal injury risk,
   recommend future research avenues to better understand these factors,
   and highlight current and future clinical applications.

AB Background & aims: Therapeutic plasma exchange (PEX) has shown potential
   in improving transplant-free survival in acute liver failure (ALF)
   however the mechanism of action is not understood. This exploratory
   study aimed to elucidate the circulating proteomic changes associated
   with PEX in ALF to provide insight into mechanisms underlying the
   benefit of this therapy. Methods: Consecutive patients admitted with ALF
   between June 2019 and August 2020 were enrolled. Patients received
   either standard medical treatment (n = 5) or PEX (n = 5). Plasma samples
   were collected at multiple time points and analysed using the Olink
   Proximity Extension Assay. Comparative analyses included healthy
   controls and Octaplas batches. Results: Biomarker results were available
   for 54 samples: Octaplas batches (n = 7), healthy controls (n = 6),
   ALFstandard medical treatment (n = 8), and ALF-PEX (n = 33). Proteomic
   analysis of 177 biomarkers revealed marked baseline differences between
   ALF and healthy controls, with ALF patients exhibiting lower levels of
   proteins secreted by the liver and higher levels of inflammatory
   cytokines and growth factors. Longitudinal analysis showed several
   distinct patterns with PEX. Proteins including carboxylesterase-1,
   hepatocyte growth factor, fetuin B, IL-6 and IL-10 showed differential
   expression patterns longitudinally, indicating some of the potential
   underlying mechanisms and therapeutic effects of PEX. Conclusions: PEX
   in ALF patients leads to dynamic proteomic changes, reflecting its
   multifaceted role in modulating inflammation, liver regeneration and
   replacing essential proteins. These findings provide insight into some
   of the changes in circulating blood proteins and underlying mechanisms
   of PEX.

AB Medical imaging, especially X-ray grayscale images, faces challenges
   like low contrast, high noise sensitivity, variability in anatomical
   structures and disease manifestations, and the often-subjective nature
   of radiographic assessments. Traditional methods struggle with these
   complexities, particularly in adapting to data distribution variances
   that impede model learning, compounded by issues like uneven
   illumination, motion artifacts, and intrinsic high dimensionality,
   leading to model poor performance. This study introduces the Permute
   Squeeze-and-Excitation (PSE) technique, an innovative technique tailored
   for image data with rich structural contextual information, designed to
   enhance frameworks like CNN and Transformer for medical imaging
   analysis. We define a novel concept termed "Structural Context", which
   encompasses the anatomical structural information and denotes the
   interconnections between different areas of the same human organ,
   typically exhibiting alignment or symmetrical characteristics. By
   recalibrating 3D attention mechanisms, PSE elevates "Structural
   Contextual Awareness", which refers to the discernment and
   interpretation of structural nuances within medical images, ensuring
   amore profound understanding and representation of the underlying
   anatomical and pathological features. Through comprehensive experiments
   and evaluations on five public datasets and eight classic baselines, the
   PSE technique has demonstrated superior performance in addressing the
   multifaceted challenges inherent in medical image processing. The
   experiments show that PSE can achieve performance improvements beyond
   mainstream methods across various tasks, including image classification
   and segmentation, with improvements reaching up to 6.1%. Meanwhile, it
   offers multiple configuration usages that can be seamlessly incorporated
   into existing workflows, promising to elevate the standard medical
   diagnostics and interventions. Further details and access to the
   methodology are provided at https: //github.com/wang0298/PSE-Module.

AB Objectives: The study (PreopWeek) aimed to assess the perioperative
   nutritional care for major surgical patients in Brazilian hospitals,
   focusing on adherence to emerging multimodal protocols like Enhanced
   Recovery After Surgery and Acceleration of Total Postoperative Recovery.
   Methods: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in
   Brazilian hospitals enrolled voluntarily from June 19 to June 23, 2023
   (convenience sample). Data were collected through patient interviews and
   medical records review. Results: Data from 219 patients up to the fifth
   postoperative day or postoperative discharge across 24 hospitals were
   analyzed. Only three hospitals (12.5%) had established institutional
   perioperative protocols. Most of the patients were female (60.3%) and
   over 60 y old (81.7%) and underwent gastrointestinal (34.7%) or
   orthopedic (33.3%) surgeries. General and nutritional preoperative
   counseling was provided to a respective 82.2% and 62.6% of the patients.
   Only 25.7% of the patients had preoperative fasting for up to 3 h, and
   28.8% received carbohydrate-rich supplements. Immunonutrition was not
   received by 43.8% at any point. Although most started postoperative
   refeeding within 24 h (81.7%), 39.4% started with a liquid diet and
   70.6% reported postoperative immobilization in the first 24 h. Notable
   differences were observed between hospitals with and without protocols.
   Hospitals with institutional protocols reported significantly more
   preoperative exercises and nutritional counseling and higher adherence
   rates for all the perioperative protocols. Conclusions: Our study
   demonstrates a lack of adherence to the multimodal protocols, even in
   hospitals with institutional protocols. Future educational programs are
   necessary to improve this result. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights are

AB The rising prevalence of cardiovascular disorders highlights the need
   for a deeper understanding of blood flow dynamics in the stenotic
   arteries to improve diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This
   investigation is motivated by the potential of the Casson nanofluids,
   which exhibit exceptional thermal properties, offering promising
   applications in medical treatments such as targeted drug delivery and
   hyperthermia therapy. The present work focuses on understanding the flow
   behavior of the Casson nanofluids through the stenosed artery under the
   influence of porosity, thermal radiation, thermophoretic particle
   diffusion and Stefen blowing. The study makes certain key assumptions,
   including the consideration of the porous nature of the arterial walls
   and the impacts of external thermal influences. Based on these
   assumptions, the governing equations are formulated and transformed into
   a system of ordinary differential equations using appropriate similarity
   transformations. These reduced equations are solved numerically using
   the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg fourth-fifth-order schemes. The important
   nondimensional factors affecting fluid velocity, thermal, and
   concentration profiles are analyzed. Further, the investigation utilizes
   advanced methods of deep learning to create models and forecast the
   intricate relationships among various variables, offering a thorough
   analysis. Escalated values of radiation and curvature parameters will
   enhance the temperature profile. Deep learning models demonstrate
   significant efficacy in analyzing and predicting stenotic conditions.
   The novel outcomes of this research highlight the effectiveness of deep
   learning models in predicting and analyzing stenotic blood flow
   conditions, contributing to improved diagnostic approaches to improve
   the patient's healthcare and reduce the mortality rate.

AB The significance of collagen and vascular in skin augmentation have been
   recognized in recent years. However, current skin tissue fillers, e.g.
   hyaluronic acid (HA) or HA-based hydrogel, fail to meet the perfect
   augmentation requirements due to their inadequate long-term support
   effect and the lack of tissue-inducing activity. Herein, an injectable
   skin filler containing hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel and lithium calcium
   silicate (LCS, Li2Ca4Si4O13) bioceramic microspheres was developed for
   skin tissue fillers, owing to the excellent biological function of
   silicate bioceramics. The HA-LCS fillers could be easily injected
   through a tiny standard medical needle (27 G) with force of less than 36
   N, and showed good biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo.
   Furthermore, the bioactive ions released from HA-LCS fillers
   significantly enhanced the expression of vascularization-related genes
   and collagen-related genes. Importantly, the HA-LCS fillers not only
   stimulated the regeneration of mature blood vessels, but also promoted
   collagen secretion in dermal skin and filling area. This study not only
   presented an injectable filler with enhanced regeneration of blood
   vessels and collagen, but also provided a new strategy for developing
   tissue-induced fillers based on bioactive components of silicate
   bioceramics.

AB Image segmentation is a pivotal phase in the image processing pipeline,
   offering detailed insights into various image features. Traditional
   segmentation methods grapple with challenges such as local minima and
   premature convergence when navigating intricate pixel search spaces.
   Additionally, these algorithms experience prolonged processing times as
   the number of threshold levels increases. To mitigate these issues, we
   implemented the Chaotic Gravitational Search Algorithm (CGSA), a robust
   optimizer, for the multi-level thresholding of COVID-19 chest CT scan
   images. CGSA amalgamates the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) for
   exploration with chaotic maps for exploitation. Kapur's entropy method
   was employed to partition the sample images based on optimal pixel
   values. The segmentation performance of CGSA was rigorously assessed on
   various COVID-19 chest CT scan imaging datasets from Kaggle, utilizing
   metrics such as Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity
   Index Measure (SSIM), and Feature Similarity Index Measure (FSIM). The
   qualitative analysis encompassed convergence curves, segmented graphs,
   colormap images, histogram curves, and boxplots. Statistical validation
   was conducted using the signed Wilcoxon rank sum test, and eight
   sophisticated heuristic algorithms were enlisted for comparative
   analysis. The comprehensive evaluation unequivocally demonstrated CGSA's
   superiority in terms of processing time efficiency and its ability to
   provide optimal values for image quality metrics, establishing it as a
   powerful tool for quickly assessing COVID-19 disease severity.

AB Bioprinting is a widely used technique for creating three-dimensional,
   complex, and heterogeneous artificial tissue constructs that are
   biologically and biophysically similar to natural tissues. The skin is
   composed of several layers including the epidermis, basement membrane
   (BM), and dermis. However, the unique undulating structure of basement
   membranes (i.e. rete ridges) and the function of BM have not been
   extensively studied in the fabrication of engineered skin substitutes.
   In this study, a novel engineered skin substitute incorporating an
   artificially designed rete ridge (i.e. mogul-shape) was developed using
   bioprinting and bioinks prepared using collagen and fibrinogen. To mimic
   the structure of the rete ridges of skin tissue, we developed a modified
   bioprinting technique, controlling rheological property of bioink to
   create a mogul-shaped layer. In vitro cellular activities, including the
   expression of specific genes (those encoding vimentin, laminin-5,
   collagen IV, and cytokeratins), demonstrated that the engineered skin
   substitute exhibited more potent cellular responses than the normally
   bioprinted control owing to the favorable biophysical BM structure and
   the bioink microenvironment. Additionally, the feasibility of utilizing
   the bioprinted skin-structure was evaluated in a mouse model, and in
   vivo results demonstrated that the bioprinted skin substitutes
   effectively promoted wound healing capabilities. Based on these results,
   we suggest that bioprinted skin tissues and the bioprinting technique
   for mimicking rete ridges can be used not only as potential lab-chip
   models for testing cosmetic materials and drugs, but also as complex
   physiological models for understanding human skin.

   regions. More than half a million patients, primarily from the Southern
   regions, engage in healthcare mobility, resulting in a total
   inter-regional transfer of resources amounting to about <euro>3.7

   a gravity model. Socioeconomic disparities and the availability of
   specialized services in some regions are the key drivers. Regions with
   higher healthcare quality and the presence of private licensed hospitals
   attract more funds. This study offers valuable insights into the
   intricacies of interregional monetary flows, and finds further evidence
   of the persistent Italian territorial dualism, which can inform

   papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection-related cervical intraepithelial
   neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) in nulligravidae under 35 y old, while also
   assessing pregnancy outcomes post-treatment.
   METHODS: Nulligravid patients aged 18-35 y with histologically confirmed
   CIN2 and HR-HPV infection were included in the study. We collected
   demographics, pertinent medical history, HPV genotypes and cervical
   length at baseline. Follow-up evaluations were conducted at 6- and 12-mo
   intervals post-treatment to assess histopathological response, HPV
   infection clearance and adverse events related to treatment.
   RESULTS: A total of 31 eligible patients were recruited and underwent FU
   treatment. At the 6-mo follow-up, complete pathologic response was
   observed in 22 out of 31 patients (70.96%), while partial response was
   seen in eight out of 31 patients (25.80%). The average duration from
   pathological diagnosis to achieving either a complete response or
   partial response after treatment was 214.36 ± 24.31 (186-270) d. The
   baseline remission rate for HPV was 35.48% at 6 mo, increasing to 71.49%
   at 12 mo. Moderate lower abdominal pain and increased vaginal discharge
   were the most frequent adverse events. Among the patients desiring
   pregnancy, the successful pregnancy rate was 57.14%, resulting in eight
   deliveries.
   CONCLUSION: FU demonstrated a favorable safety profile and efficacy in
   nulliparous females under 35 y old with CIN2, and its benefits for
   fertility warrant further investigation.

AB Medical image segmentation's accuracy is crucial for clinical analysis
   and diagnosis. Despite progress with U-Net-inspired models, they often
   underuse multi-scale convolutional layers crucial for enhancing
   detailing visual features and overlooking the importance of merging
   multi-scale features within the channel dimension to enhance decoder
   complexity. To address these limitations, we introduce a
   Multi-perspective Feature Compensation Enhanced Network (MFCNet) for
   medical image segmentation. Our network design is characterized by the
   strategic employment of dual-scale convolutional kernels at each encoder
   level. This synergy enables the precise capture of both granular and
   broader context features throughout the encoding phase. We further
   enhance the model by integrating a Dual-scale Channel-wise Cross-fusion
   Transformer (DCCT) mechanism within the skip connections. This
   innovation effectively integrates dual-scale features. We subsequently
   implemented the spatial attention (SA) mechanism to amplify the saliency
   areas within the dual-scale features. These enhanced features were
   subsequently merged with the feature map of the same level in the
   decoder, thereby augmenting the overall feature representation. Our
   proposed MFCNet has been evaluated on three distinct medical image
   datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves more
   accurate segmentation performance and adaptability to varying target
   segmentation, making it more competitive compared to existing methods.

AB Prediction of Cardiovascular disease (CVD) with a more accurate and
   timely diagnosis is crucial to ensure accurate classification, which
   assists medical professionals in providing appropriate treatment to the
   patient. Recently, healthcare organizations have begun utilizing
   Internet of Things (IoT) technology to gather sensor information for the
   purpose of diagnosing and forecasting heart disease. Cloud computing
   solutions have been utilized to manage the vast amount of data created
   by IoT devices in the medical profession, which amounts to an enormous
   number. Heart disease prediction is a challenging undertaking that
   demands both sophisticated knowledge and expertise. Although a lot of
   study has been done on the diagnosis of heart disease, the results are
   not very accurate. Further protecting the data from numerous general
   privacy concerns is a complex process. To address these limitations,
   this research utilizes the Finch hunt optimization modified BiLSTM
   classifier (FHO modified BiLSTM) to develop an IoT enabled Heart disease
   prediction model. Further, the incorporation of the smart IoT-based
   framework assists in monitoring heart disease patients and provides
   effective, timely, and quality healthcare services. Additionally, to
   improve mobility, privacy, security, low latency, and bandwidth, the
   biomedical data are stored in a cloud server that is equipped with a
   decentralized blockchain. The proposed approach exploits the Bi-LSTM
   model to improve the prediction abilities and extract intricate temporal
   patterns from patient data by combining predictive modeling.
   Specifically, the FHO integrates the characteristics of honey badger and
   sparrow to find the optimal solution for tuning the hyperparameters in
   the modified BiLSTM which in turn enhances the prediction accuracy. For
   analyzing the performance of the proposed method the CACHETCADB dataset
   with 1602 samples is utilized. The experimental results demonstrates
   that the proposed FHOmodified Bi-LSTM attains the values of 95.17%,
   96.52%, 93.86%, and 97.24% for F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy
   respectively at 80% of training which exceeded the other existing
   techniques.

AB In medical image segmentation, conventional methodologies based on the
   UNet method often focus on improving the network performance but
   overlook the parameters and computational complexity. Due to the
   limitation of computing resources, these methods can hardly be applied
   in the landscape of point-of-care (PoC) applications. This study
   presents UNeSt, a rapid segmentation network tailored for colorectal
   polyps. The architectural foundation of UNeSt hinges upon the
   synergistic integration of the depth separable convolutional layer (DSC)
   and multilayer perceptron (MLP). UNeSt achieves an innovative fusion of
   these components, resulting in a substantial reduction in model
   parameters and computational complexity, which is concomitant with a
   remarkable enhancement in inference speed. Specifically, UNeSt
   incorporates the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) within the
   convolutional encoder to extract channel and spatial information
   proficiently. Furthermore, we introduce an attention mechanism to
   address the positional information discrepancies introduced in the MLP
   stage. This comprehensive approach contributes significantly to the
   augmentation of accuracy in colorectal polyp segmentation. Finally,
   UNeSt employs skip connections between various levels of encoders and
   decoders, thereby mitigating information loss problems. In the context
   of this investigation, UNeSt underwent rigorous evaluation using a
   demanding polyp segmentation dataset. Relative to UNeXt, a widely
   employed and exceedingly lightweight network model, the proposed model
   in this study exhibits a noteworthy reduction with 1.6x fewer
   parameters, a 2.5x decrease in computational complexity (measured in
   GFLOPs), and a 1.9x acceleration in inference speed.

AB The cochlea is one of the most complex organs in the human body,
   exhibiting a complex interplay of characteristics in acoustic,
   mechanical, electrical, and biological functions. Functional cochlea
   models are an essential platform for studying hearing mechanics and are
   crucial for developing next-generation auditory prostheses and
   artificial hearing systems for sensorineural hearing restoration. Recent
   advances in additive manufacturing, organ-on-a-chip models, drug
   delivery platforms, and artificial intelligence have provided valuable
   insights into how to manufacture artificial cochlea models that more
   accurately replicate the complex anatomy and physiology of the inner
   ear. This paper reviews recent advancements in the applications of
   advanced manufacturing techniques in reproducing the physical,
   biological, and intelligent functions of the cochlea. It also outlines
   the current challenges to developing mechanically, electrically, and
   anatomically accurate functional models of the inner ear. Finally, this
   review identifies the major requirements and outlook for impactful
   research in this field going forward. Through interdisciplinary
   collaboration and innovation, these functional cochlea models are poised
   to drive significant advancements in hearing treatments, and ultimately
   enhance the quality of life for individuals with hearing loss.

AB This paper studies the optimization of task assignment and pickup and

   vehicles (UAVs). We specifically address the distribution of emergency
   medical supplies, including medications, vaccines, and essential medical
   aid, as well as the collection of biological blood samples for testing
   and analysis. Unique challenges, such as supply shortages, time windows,
   and geographical considerations, are explicitly taken into account. The
   problem is first formulated as a mixed- integer linear programming model
   aimed at maximizing the total profit derived from the execution of a set
   of emergency healthcare pickup and delivery tasks. An enhanced
   Q-learning-based adaptive large neighborhood search (QALNS) is proposed
   for large-scale benchmark instances. QALNS exhibits a superior
   performance on benchmark instances. It also improves the quality of the
   solutions on average by 5.49% and 6.86% compared to the Gurobi solver
   and a state-of-the-art adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm,
   respectively. Sensitivity analyses are performed on critical factors
   contributing to the performance of the QALNS algorithm, such as the
   learning rate and the discount indicator. Finally, we provide managerial
   insights on the use of the fleet of UAVs and the design of the network.

   supports the possibility of shared medical therapies, though abrogating
   calcific extracellular vesicle shedding could be a common target for all

AB Prostate cancer (PCa) poses a significant threat to men's health, with
   early diagnosis being crucial for improving prognosis and reducing
   mortality rates. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) plays a vital role in the
   diagnosis and image-guided intervention of PCa. To facilitate physicians
   with more accurate and efficient computer-assisted diagnosis and
   interventions, many image processing algorithms in TRUS have been
   proposed and achieved state-of-the-art performance in several tasks,
   including prostate gland segmentation, prostate image registration, PCa
   classification and detection and interventional needle detection. The
   rapid development of these algorithms over the past 2 decades
   necessitates a comprehensive summary. As a consequence, this survey
   provides a narrative review of this field, outlining the evolution of
   image processing methods in the context of TRUS image analysis and
   meanwhile highlighting their relevant contributions. Furthermore, this
   survey discusses current challenges and suggests future research
   directions to possibly advance this field further.

AB Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) applications, called also Medical
   Internet of Things (MIoT) or IoT for e-health, allow integrating smart
   technologies to medical devices for a better monitoring of disease
   progression and patients tracking. While it offers extensive benefits
   and despite of its expansion, IoMT brings round additional security
   concerns. Connected Medical Devices (CMD) raise up several security and
   privacy problems. The complexity and heterogeneity of data and
   technology in IoMT communications create additional security risks and
   threats. Malicious users may exploit crucial vulnerabilities in a wide
   range of IoMT applications, networks and devices. Hence, thinking about
   smart and efficient security solutions is an urgent need to understand
   and assess IoMT-related threats. Existing traditional models are no
   longer convenient and remain unsuitable to address the various born
   risks. We present in the current manuscript an in depth study of
   security concerns within IoMT. We review popular risk assessment and
   management approaches and discuss their suitability to the IoMT context.
   The main shortcomings are inherent to the complex architecture, the lack
   of automation and the numerous stakeholders with different security
   needs and skills.With reference to the conducted study, we introduce our
   solution as a framework to enhance trustworthiness and support decision
   making within IoMT environments. The proposal relies on a fine-grained
   approach for managing associated risks with regard to different areas of
   focus and common risk factors. To do so, a Machine Learning (ML)-based
   anomaly detection model and a hybrid Risk Assessment (RA) model are
   defined to evaluate cumulative IoMT risk. Experiments show obtained
   competitive results compared to state of the art ML models to detect
   intrusions in IoT/IoMT systems and we obtained an accuracy rate of 100%
   with some algorithms. A use case of application is presented to
   highlight the efficiency of the proposal.

AB INTRODUCTION: Intensive care unit-acquired weakness (ICUAW) is
   associated with unfavorable outcomes. The current diagnostic tools for
   ICUAW are invasive, yield delayed results, and lack precision. This
   study explored the potential of shear wave elastography (SWE), an
   innovative ultrasound technique, to evaluate the quality changes in the
   lower extremity muscles of ICU patients, potentially aiding the early
   detection of ICUAW.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included adult patients diagnosed with ICUAW
   (average Medical Research Council score < 48) from December 2020 to
   October 2021. ICU patients were continuously monitored twice daily.
   Using ultrasonography, we measured the thickness (TH), cross-sectional
   area (CSA), pennation angle (PA), and SWE (SWE-values) modulus of the
   bilateral rectus femoris (RF) and vastus intermedius (VI). The
   diagnostic performance of each parameter was evaluated using
   sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve.
   RESULTS: Ultrasound quantification assessments were performed in 47
   patients, 24 with ICUAW and 23 without ICUAW. Notably, PA decreased (RF:
   11.33%, VI: 10.51%), while muscle rigidity increased (RF: 22.39%, VI:
   22.50%) in ICUAW patients compared with non-ICUAW patients. The
   sensitivity and specificity for PA in the RF were 79.17% and 91.30%,
   respectively, and those for PA in VI were 79.17% and 78.26%,
   respectively. The use of both combinations yielded 91.67% and 73.91%
   sensitivity and specificity, respectively. Employing the PA of RF and
   SWE-values of RF together, we observed a diagnostic prediction
   sensitivity of 91.67% and a specificity of 60.87%.
   CONCLUSIONS: ICUAW patients exhibited increased rigidity of the lower
   extremity muscles during their hospital stay. Ultrasonic SWE emerged as
   a reliable and objective tool, offering significant diagnostic value for
   ICUAW.

AB Microstates represent brief periods of quasi-stable
   electroencephalography (EEG) scalp topography, offering insights into
   dynamic fluctuations in event-related potential (ERP) topographies.
   Despite this, there is a lack of a comprehensive systematic overview of
   microstate findings concerning cognitive face processing. This review
   aims to summarize ERP findings on face processing using microstate
   analyses and assess their effectiveness in characterizing face-related
   neural representations. A literature search was conducted for microstate
   ERP studies involving healthy individuals and psychiatric populations,
   utilizing PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, PsychInfo, and Scopus
   databases. Twenty-two studies were identified, primarily focusing on
   healthy individuals (n = 16), with a smaller subset examining
   psychiatric populations (n = 6). The evidence reviewed in this study
   suggests that various microstates are consistently associated with
   distinct ERP stages involved in face processing, encompassing the
   processing of basic visual facial features to more complex functions
   such as analytical processing, facial recognition, and semantic
   representations. Furthermore, these studies shed light on atypical
   attentional neural mechanisms in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), facial
   recognition deficits among emotional dysregulation disorders, and
   encoding and semantic dysfunctions in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
   (PTSD). In conclusion, this review underscores the practical utility of
   ERP microstate analyses in investigating face processing. Methodologies
   have evolved towards greater automation and data-driven approaches over
   time. Future research should aim to forecast clinical outcomes and
   conduct validation studies to directly demonstrate the efficacy of such
   analyses in inverse space.

AB Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterised primarily by motor
   system degeneration, with clinical evidence of cognitive and behavioural
   change in up to 50% of cases. We have shown previously that
   resting-state EEG captures dysfunction in motor and cognitive networks
   in ALS. However, the longitudinal development of these dysfunctional
   patterns, especially in networks linked with cognitive-behavioural
   functions, remains unclear. Longitudinal studies on non-motor changes in
   ALS are essential to further develop our understanding of disease
   progression, improve care and enhance the evaluation of new treatments.
   To address this gap, we examined 124 ALS individuals with 128-channel
   resting-state EEG recordings, categorised by cognitive impairment
   (ALSci, n = 25), behavioural impairment (ALSbi, n = 58), or non-impaired
   (ALSncbi, n = 53), with 12 participants meeting the criteria for both
   ALSci and ALSbi. Using linear mixed-effects models, we characterised the
   general and phenotype-specific longitudinal changes in brain network,
   and their association with cognitive performance, behaviour changes,
   fine motor symptoms, and survival. Our findings revealed a significant
   decline in \documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath}

   subgroups and correlated with motor, cognitive, and behavioural decline,
   as well as with survival. Spectral EEG measures can longitudinally track
   abnormal network patterns, serving as a candidate stratification tool
   for clinical trials and personalised treatments in ALS.

AB The distribution of vaccines poses a critical challenge, particularly
   during public emergencies. This paper introduces a decision support
   framework to address the requirement of vaccine supply distribution in
   medical emergencies by optimizing an artificial neural network (ANN)
   model with hyperbolic secant grey wolf optimization (HSGWO) techniques.
   The proposed hyperbolic HSGWO-ANN model offers a method for optimizing
   vaccine requirement by efficiently allocating resources, thereby
   improving decision-making processes in vaccine supply and enhancing
   healthcare outcomes. Utilizing HSGWO-ANN model, our research aids
   decision makers or governmental bodies in strategically allocating
   vaccines to high-risk locations, mitigating the impact of pandemics.
   Initially, HSGWO employs a hyperbolic secant function to explore search
   space and enhances exploration and exploitation capabilities.
   Subsequently, HSGWO is integrated with ANN to optimize weights and
   minimize training error for accurate prediction. Furthermore, we compute
   normalized regression residuals for each location with the highest risk
   for vaccine deployment. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
   HSGWO-ANN model on two numerical datasets using error measures such as
   Root mean squared and Mean absolute percentage errors, and correlation
   coefficients such as R2\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

   demonstrate that the HSGWO-ANN model outperforms existing models,
   exhibiting lower error rates and stronger correlations, thus offering a
   more efficient solution for vaccine distribution.

AB The technology of connected intelligent objects dedicated to health has
   become a buzzword in medical circles. It has emerged as a popular trend
   in the world of health technology, but its growing popularity also
   raises concerns about security. Sensitive data stored on these devices,
   such as personal medical information, make them vulnerable to
   cyberattacks and data breaches. To prevent attacks on this technology,
   we have proposed a robust mutual authentication scheme that ensures
   perfectly secure communication for all information exchanged between the
   different participants forming the network of connected intelligent
   objects. Various experimental results consistently demonstrate that our
   proposed authentication solution outperforms its competitors in terms of
   robustness against various types of attacks on networks of connected
   intelligent objects. Additionally, it offers superior performance in
   terms of storage efficiency, communication and computational costs, and
   energy consumption.

AB Repairing code smells detected in the code or design of the system is
   one of the activities contributing to increasing the software quality.
   In this study, we investigate the impact of non-numerical information of
   software, such as project status information combined with machine
   learning techniques, on improving code smell detection. For this
   purpose, we constructed a dataset consisting of 22 systems with various
   project statuses, 12,040 classes, and 18 features that included 1935
   large classes. A set of experiments was conducted with ten different
   machine learning techniques by dividing the dataset into training,
   validation, and testing sets to detect the large class code smell.
   Feature selection and data balancing techniques have been applied. The
   classifier's performance was evaluated using six indicators: precision,
   recall, F-measure, MCC, ROC area, and Kappa tests. The preliminary
   experimental results reveal that feature selection and data balancing
   have poor influence on the accuracy of machine learning classifiers.
   Moreover, they vary their behavior when utilized in sets with different
   values for the selected project status information of their classes. The
   average value of classifiers performance when fed with status
   information is better than without. The Random Forest achieved the best
   behavior according to all performance indicators (100%) with status
   information, while AdaBoostM1 and SMO achieved the worst in most of them
   (> 86%). According to the findings of this study, providing machine
   learning techniques with project status information about the classes to
   be analyzed can improve the results of large class detection.

   more attention in the security evaluation of electronic devices. The
   impact of the attacks on medical devices can be very dangerous: from
   retrieving private health data to attacking implantable devices causing
   life-threatening situations. This paper investigates the vulnerabilities
   of ECG characterization devices to power side-channel attacks and
   proposes power supply voltage modulation as a countermeasure.
   Experimental results indicate that random voltage modulation can
   effectively obscure heart rate retrieval from leaked power signals. Sine
   modulation is less effective and can be canceled by demodulation at the
   sine frequency visible in the leaked signal spectrum.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there are latitude and seasonal
   differences in the prevalence of mood episodes (depression and mania) in
   youth and young adults with Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (BD).
   METHODS: Mood polarity was prospectively evaluated in 413 participants
   with BD. Participants were enrolled in the Course and Outcome of Bipolar
   Youth (COBY) study at three sites (University of California Los
   Angeles-UCLA, Brown University, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical
   Center-UPMC) and interviewed on average every 7months for an average of
   91.9months (range: 6-228months), with a total of 274,123 weekly mood
   ratings. Associations between light exposure and mood polarity were
   estimated using generalized linear mixed models with time-varying
   covariates, considering the latitude and seasonality of the study sites
   and other potential confounders.
   RESULTS: Average age at intake and at last assessment was 12.6±3.3 and
   27.2±4.8years-old, respectively. There were significantly more
   depressive episodes during winter than during summer, spring, and
   autumn. Considering latitude, UCLA showed significantly lower prevalence
   of depressive episodes, and an absence of seasonal pattern of
   depression, compared to the Brown/UPMC sites. For the entire sample,
   there were more manic/hypomanic episodes during summer than during
   winter. However, there were no significant between site seasonal
   differences in the prevalence of manic/hypomanic episodes.
   CONCLUSIONS: Depressive episodes are more prevalent during the winter
   and although less significant, manic/hypomanic episodes during the
   summer. Awareness and interventions to prevent or ameliorate the effects
   of seasonal variations in mood changes in BD are warranted.

AB OBJECTIVE: To develop a comprehensive nomogram to predict the
   histological grading of breast cancer and further examine its clinical
   significance by integrating both intra-tumoral and peri-tumoral
   ultrasound radiomics features.
   METHODS: In a retrospective study 468 female breast cancer patients were
   analyzed from 2017 to 2020 at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin
   Medical University. Patients were grouped into high-grade (n = 215) and
   low-grade (n = 253) categories based on pathological evaluation. Tumor
   regions of interest were defined and expanded automatically to
   peri-tumor regions of interest. Ultrasound radiomics features were
   extracted independently. To ensure rigor, cases were randomly divided
   into 80% training and 20% test sets. Optimal features were selected
   using statistical and machine learning methods. Intra-tumor, peri-tumor,
   and combined radiomics models were constructed. To determine the best
   predictors of breast cancer histological grading, we screened the
   features using single- and multi-factor logistic regression analyses.
   Finally, a nomogram was developed and evaluated for its predictive value
   in this context.
   RESULTS: By applying logistic regression, we integrated ultrasound,
   clinicopathologic, and radiomics features to generate a nomogram. The
   combined model outperformed others, achieving areas under the curve of
   0.934 and 0.812 in training and test sets. Calibration curves also
   showed high accuracy and reliability.
   CONCLUSION: A nomogram constructed through the integration of combined
   intra-tumor-peri-tumor ultrasound radiomics features along with
   clinicopathologic characteristics exhibited remarkable performance in
   distinguishing the histologic grades of invasive breast cancer.

AB The recent advancements in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) have
   significantly contributed to improving personalized medicine and patient
   diagnosis and monitoring. Nonetheless, the implementation of IoMT may
   encounter obstacles due to security and privacy concerns. Federated
   learning emerges as a promising solution, enabling multiple devices to
   collaborate on training rich, heterogeneous datasets while preserving
   privacy. Despite its potential, traditional federated learning methods
   exhibit vulnerabilities such as single points of attack or failure and
   performance degradation with heterogeneous data. To this end, this paper
   proposes a blockchain federated learning system to address these
   limitations. In the proposed blockchain, a Proof-of-Contribution-Earned
   (PoCE) consensus protocol is designed for block propagation and miners'
   selection using an improved addition tic-tac-toe game. To overcome the
   challenge related to heterogeneous data, a reward system based on a
   cooperation strategy is proposed to ensure that high-quality data is
   shared among health institutions. We employ a Convolutional Neural
   Network (CNN) where we replace the fully connected layers with sparse
   ones to minimize the number of parameters using an exponential random
   graph while maintaining model accuracy. The experimental results on
   real-world heterogeneous data demonstrate that the proposed system
   outperforms existing state-of-the-art systems in terms of accuracy and
   convergence rate. Security analysis reveals that the proposed system is
   robust against existing security and privacy-related attacks.

AB Digital Pathology is a fast-growing field. It enables assessing disease
   grading, treatment progression, patient prognosis, etc. These analyses
   are carried out using whole slide tissue images (WSI). Processing of
   WSIs is costly due to their high resolutions (may reach over
   100,000x\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath}

   \begin{document}$$\times$$\end{document}100,000 pixels). Modern parallel
   machines offer adequate computing power to enable fast analyses of WSIs.
   However, WSI partitioning for parallel load-balanced execution can be
   hard. This occurs because different areas of a WSI can have
   distinct/irregular processing costs. We address this problem with a
   novel algorithm called Background Removal Bisection (BRB), which
   considers heterogeneity in data processing costs. BRB extends our
   previous cost-aware data partitioning solution (CADP). The contributions
   of BRB are: i) a strategy to generate irregular-shaped cost-balanced
   partitions; ii) effective hierarchical fine-grained background pruning;
   and, iii) a cost cache that reduces partitioning runtime, essential for
   large-scale executions. We deployed BRB into the Region Templates
   runtime and evaluated it with a cancer WSI analysis application.
   Compared to CADP, BRB achieved speedups of up to

AB In the search for new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for infectious
   diseases, several molecules have been investigated. Small RNAs, known as
   microRNAs (miRs), are important regulators of gene expression, and have
   emerged as promising candidates for these purposes. MiRs are a class of
   small, endogenous non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in several
   human diseases, including host-pathogen interaction mechanisms.
   Recently, miRs signatures have been reported in different infectious
   diseases, opening new perspectives for molecular diagnosis and therapy.
   MiR profiles can discriminate between healthy individuals and patients,
   as well as distinguish different disease stages. Furthermore, the
   possibility of assessing miRs in biological fluids, such as serum and
   whole blood, renders these molecules feasible for the development of new
   non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic tools. In this manuscript, we
   will comprehensively describe miRs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets
   in infectious diseases and explore how they can contribute to the
   advance of existing and new tools. Additionally, we will discuss
   different miR analysis platforms to understand the obstacles and
   advances of this molecular approach and propose their potential clinical
   applications and contributions to public health.

AB In recent years, there has been a mounting occurrence of lung cancer,
   which stands as one of the most prevalent malignancies globally. This
   rise in incidence poses a significant hazard to human health, making
   lung cancer a matter of grave concern. It has been shown that
   tRNA-derived small non-coding RNA (tsRNA) is involved in the development
   of tumors, especially lung cancer, through mechanisms such as regulating
   mRNA stability, influencing protein translation, and acting as
   epigenetic regulators. Recent studies have shown that tsRNA is
   abnormally expressed in the plasma and tissues of lung cancer patients,
   and its expression level is closely related to the malignancy degree and
   postoperative recurrence of lung cancer. Therefore, for lung cancer
   patients, tsRNA represents a promising non-invasive biomarker,
   exhibiting significant potential for facilitating early diagnosis and
   prognostic evaluation, and for achieving precision treatment of lung
   cancer by regulating its expression. This article focuses on the
   biogenesis of tsRNA and its ability to promote lung cancer cell
   proliferation and invasion. In addition, the specific clinical
   significance of tsRNA in lung cancer was discussed. Finally, we discuss
   the need for further improvement of small RNA sequencing technology, and
   the future research directions and strategies of tsRNA in lung cancer
   and tumor diseases were summarized.

AB Determining the mechanical characteristics of the artery is very
   essential for the production of vascular implants. In the present work,
   the mechanical characteristics of arterial walls were investigated by
   considering plaque and stent in a 3D model. This article aims to
   investigate the effect of the arterial tissue with the same boundary
   conditions and restrictions for an artery blocked with the plaque and
   stent, in creating stress in the tissue. An intravascular stent
   implantation is a treatment method whose success largely depends on the
   mechanical characteristics of each vascular component, plaque and stent,
   and blood flow pressure. For opening up the blood flow in the blocked
   artery, stents could be used as medical devices. In this research, a
   stent was designed, and its impact on all three models of elastic,
   viscoelastic, and hyper-elastic arterial tissue with plaque was studied
   and compared. An ideal finite element model was made to find the effect
   of three types of the artery tissue (elastic, viscoelastic,
   hyper-elastic) with the systolic and diastolic blood flow pressure to
   observe the stress and the deformation of arteries, plaques, and stents.
   In addition, for the hyper-elastic model, two Mooney-Rivlin and Ogden
   models were also investigated. It was found that the type of artery had
   an effective impact on the result of the stress and the deformation
   created in the stented artery. Moreover, the results illustrated that
   considering different models for the artery tissue affected the plaque
   and stent behavior. Arteries exhibit interesting mechanical behaviors.
   In the present study, an attempt was made to investigate different
   mechanical behaviors of arteries with the plaque and stent obstruction.
   In the examined models, the stress for the artery and plaque was higher
   in the Ogden model and the lowest one was in the viscoelastic model, and
   the deformation was higher in the viscoelastic model and lower in the
   Ogden model. It should be noted that the average stress for the vessel
   in the Ogden model was about 50% higher than the viscoelastic model.
   Pathological changes in the walls of the vessels can lead to high-risk
   cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes. Understanding
   arterial mechanical behaviors provides valuable insight into disease.
   Therefore, the investigation of different behavioral models helps to
   evaluate the behavior of the arterial wall by considering the
   composition and function of the tissue.

AB With the aging of the population, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) has increased dramatically, causing severe medical, care, and
   economic burdens on society and families. The efficacy of rivastigmine
   hydrogen tartrate (RHT), the first-line clinical treatment, is severely

   RHT, achieving the multi-target pharmacology for AD treatment. On the
   other hand, a tailored nose-to-brain drug delivery system was
   established for the satisfactory nose-to-brain delivery efficiency,
   avoiding the obstacle of BBB through bypassing it. In the
   pharmacodynamic study based on AD rat model, GRg3@RHT exhibited
   obviously synergic effect, effectively break the vicious cycle of AD
   progression, ultimately markedly ameliorating learning and memory
   ability as well as behavioral dysfunctions, and delaying the
   neurodegenerative process associated with AD. In addition, the strong
   correlation of viscosity-droplet size-plume geometry-olfactory
   deposition was also established, and further proved by the in vivo
   pharmacokinetic study, which is proposed to provide evidence to enhance
   nose-to-brain delivery efficiency. This study is anticipated to provide
   novel insights into AD treatment strategies while offering innovative
   ideas for drug delivery approaches targeting nervous system disorders.

AB Smart healthcare is the result of recent developments in cloud
   computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things
   (IoT). These technologies have replaced the traditional healthcare
   system. Medical services can be enhanced by merging important
   technologies like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.
   The healthcare industry has several potential as a result of the
   convergence of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things. From
   this angle, a convergence-based model for diagnosing heart disease based
   on IoT and artificial intelligence is presented in the current research
   study for a smart healthcare system. This paper's primary objective is
   to use Internet of Things and artificial intelligence convergence
   techniques to create a disease detection model for cardiac disorders.
   The phases in the model that is being described involve gathering data,
   pre-processing, classifying, and configuring parameters. Wearables and
   other IoT devices make it easy to collect data, and AI tools analyze
   that data to diagnose diseases. For illness diagnosis, the suggested
   approach makes use of the cascaded short-term memory model
   (CuSO-MuLSTM), which is based on the Cuckoo search optimization
   algorithm. CuSO is used to modify the MuLSTM model's "weight" and "bias"
   parameters in order to better classify medical data. Furthermore,
   outliers have been eliminated from this study project using the
   isolation forest technique (iForest). The diagnostic outcomes of the
   MuLSTM model are significantly improved by the application of CuSO.
   Using medical data, the CuSO-MuLSTM model's performance was verified.
   The CuSO-MuLSTM model that was presented during the trial was able to
   diagnose diabetes and heart disease with maximum accuracy of 98.32% and
   98.19%, respectively. As a result, the suggested CuSO-MuLSTM model can
   be used to smart healthcare systems as an appropriate illness diagnosis
   tool.

AB Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) have received a lot of attention due
   to various medical and non-medical applications. However, the sensor
   energy remains a limitation for the lifetime of WBANs and eventually
   providing sustainable services. The highest amount of energy consumption
   is related to the sampling operation of the sensors. Therefore, reducing
   the sampling rate is the key solution to extend network lifetime.
   Though, existing sampling algorithms have two issues: (1) Existing
   methods increase energy consumption through unnecessary data sampling
   and (2) are a way of energy saving and cannot guarantee
   self-sustainability of sensors. Therefore, a Dynamic Sampling method
   based on Change Rate (DSCR) for energy-harvesting body nodes is proposed
   in this paper to address these two problems. Each node in DSCR is
   equipped with an adaptive energy manager. The node uses different
   methods for determining the sampling rate based on the energy level of
   sensor and the quality of energy harvesting in order to make the WBANs
   energy neutral. The energy manager in DSCR classifies the sensors into
   three classes A, B, and C in terms of the level of energy. The sampling
   rate of each class is determined independently. The simulations show
   that, compared to the state-the-art methods, the proposed method can
   reduce the sampling rate by 50.84% and data overhead by 78% on average
   while conserving data integrity.

AB In the current landscape of online data services, data transmission and
   cloud computing are often controlled separately by Internet Service
   Providers (ISPs) and cloud providers, resulting in significant
   cooperation challenges and suboptimal global data service optimization.
   In this study, we propose an end-to-end scheduling method aimed at
   supporting low-latency and computation-intensive medical services within
   local wireless networks and healthcare clouds. This approach serves as a
   practical paradigm for achieving low-latency data services in local
   private cloud environments. To meet the low-latency requirement while
   minimizing communication and computation resource usage, we leverage
   Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to learn a policy for
   automatically regulating the transmission rate of medical services and
   the computation speed of cloud servers. Additionally, we utilize a
   two-stage tandem queue to address this problem effectively. Extensive
   experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness for our proposed
   method under various arrival rates of medical services.

AB The combination of multiple drugs is a significant therapeutic strategy
   that can enhance treatment effectiveness and reduce medication side
   effects. However, identifying effective synergistic drug combinations in
   a vast search space remains challenging. Current methods for predicting
   synergistic drug combinations primarily rely on calculating drug
   similarity based on the drug heterogeneous network or drug information,
   enabling the prediction of pairwise synergistic drug combinations.
   However, these methods not only fail to fully study the rich information
   in drug heterogeneous networks, but also can only predict pairwise drug
   combinations. To address these limitations, we present a novel
   Synergistic Multi-drug Combination prediction method of Western medicine
   based on Heterogeneous Network representation learning with Contrastive
   Learning, called SMC-HNCL. Specifically, two drug features are learnt
   from different perspectives using the drug heterogeneous network and
   anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) codes, and fused by attention
   mechanism. Furthermore, a group representation method based on
   multi-head self-attention is employed to learn representations of drug
   combinations, innovatively realizing the prediction of synergistic
   multi-drug combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that SMC-HNCL
   outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in predicting
   synergistic drug pairs on two synergistic drug combination datasets and
   can also effectively predict synergistic multi-drug combinations.

AB Diffusion models are a type of generative deep learning model that can
   process medical images more efficiently than traditional generative
   models. They have been applied to several medical image computing tasks.
   This paper aims to help researchers understand the advancements of
   diffusion models in medical image computing. It begins by describing the
   fundamental principles, sampling methods, and architecture of diffusion
   models. Subsequently, it discusses the application of diffusion models
   in five medical image computing tasks: image generation, modality
   conversion, image segmentation, image denoising, and anomaly detection.
   Additionally, this paper conducts fine-tuning of a large model for image
   generation tasks and comparative experiments between diffusion models
   and traditional generative models across these five tasks. The
   evaluation of the fine-tuned large model shows its potential for
   clinical applications. Comparative experiments demonstrate that
   diffusion models have a distinct advantage in tasks related to image
   generation, modality conversion, and image denoising. However, they
   require further optimization in image segmentation and anomaly detection
   tasks to match the efficacy of traditional models. Our codes are

AB Focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy generates sufficient heat for medical
   interventions like tumor ablation by concentrating energy at the focal
   point. The complex viscoelastic properties of biological tissues pose
   challenges in balancing focusing precision and penetration depth,
   impacting the safety of surrounding tissues and treatment efficacy. This
   study develops an acoustic-solid-thermal coupling computational model to
   elucidate the dynamic mechanical response and energy dissipation
   mechanisms of soft tissue during FUS thermal therapy using a
   hyper-viscoelastic constitutive model. Results indicate that the high
   compressibility and low shear resistance of biological tissues result in
   a unique shear dissipation mechanism. Energy dissipation efficiency per
   area is indirectly influenced by load frequency via its effect on the
   dynamic shear modulus and is directly proportional to load amplitude.
   Focusing precision, represented by the focal zone width, is inversely
   controlled by frequency via wavelength. A mathematical model for
   evaluating temperature rise efficiency is proposed, and an optimal
   frequency for efficient FUS thermal therapy in brain-like soft materials
   is identified. This research elucidates the link between viscoelastic
   tissue behavior and FUS treatment outcomes, offering insights for
   optimizing FUS applications in various medical fields.

AB Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from
   deficits in synaptic transmission and homeostasis. The Alzheimer's
   disease brain tends to be hyperexcitable and hypersynchronized, thereby
   causing neurodegeneration and ultimately disrupting the operational
   abilities in daily life, leaving patients incapacitated. Repetitive
   transcranial magnetic stimulation is a cost-effective, neuro-modulatory
   technique used for multiple neurological conditions. Over the past two
   decades, it has been widely used to predict cognitive decline; identify
   pathophysiological markers; promote neuroplasticity; and assess brain
   excitability, plasticity, and connectivity. It has also been applied to
   patients with dementia, because it can yield facilitatory effects on
   cognition and promote brain recovery after a neurological insult.
   However, its therapeutic effectiveness at the molecular and synaptic
   levels has not been elucidated because of a limited number of studies.
   This study aimed to characterize the neurobiological changes following
   repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment, evaluate its
   effects on synaptic plasticity, and identify the associated mechanisms.
   This review essentially focuses on changes in the pathology,
   amyloidogenesis, and clearance pathways, given that amyloid deposition
   is a major hypothesis in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.
   Apoptotic mechanisms associated with repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation procedures and different pathways mediating gene
   transcription, which are closely related to the neural regeneration
   process, are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss the outcomes of
   animal studies in which neuroplasticity is modulated and assessed at the
   structural and functional levels by using repetitive transcranial
   magnetic stimulation, with the aim to highlight future directions for
   better clinical translations.

AB Spinal cord injury results in the loss of sensory, motor, and autonomic
   functions, which almost always produces permanent physical disability.
   Thus, in the search for more effective treatments than those already
   applied for years, which are not entirely efficient, researches have
   been able to demonstrate the potential of biological strategies using
   biomaterials to tissue manufacturing through bioengineering and stem
   cell therapy as a neuroregenerative approach, seeking to promote
   neuronal recovery after spinal cord injury. Each of these strategies has
   been developed and meticulously evaluated in several animal models with
   the aim of analyzing the potential of interventions for neuronal repair
   and, consequently, boosting functional recovery. Although the majority
   of experimental research has been conducted in rodents, there is
   increasing recognition of the importance, and need, of evaluating the
   safety and efficacy of these interventions in non-human primates before
   moving to clinical trials involving therapies potentially promising in
   humans. This article is a literature review from databases (PubMed,
   Science Direct, Elsevier, Scielo, Redalyc, Cochrane, and NCBI) from 10
   years ago to date, using keywords (spinal cord injury, cell therapy,
   non-human primates, humans, and bioengineering in spinal cord injury).
   From 110 retrieved articles, after two selection rounds based on
   inclusion and exclusion criteria, 21 articles were analyzed. Thus, this
   review arises from the need to recognize the experimental therapeutic
   advances applied in non-human primates and even humans, aimed at
   deepening these strategies and identifying the advantages and influence
   of the results on extrapolation for clinical applicability in humans.

AB Retinal aging has been recognized as a significant risk factor for
   various retinal disorders, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related
   macular degeneration, and glaucoma, following a growing understanding of
   the molecular underpinnings of their development. This comprehensive
   review explores the mechanisms of retinal aging and investigates
   potential neuroprotective approaches, focusing on the activation of
   transcription factor EB. Recent meta-analyses have demonstrated
   promising outcomes of transcription factor EB-targeted strategies, such
   as exercise, calorie restriction, rapamycin, and metformin, in patients
   and animal models of these common retinal diseases. The review
   critically assesses the role of transcription factor EB in retinal
   biology during aging, its neuroprotective effects, and its therapeutic
   potential for retinal disorders. The impact of transcription factor EB
   on retinal aging is cell-specific, influencing metabolic reprogramming
   and energy homeostasis in retinal neurons through the regulation of
   mitochondrial quality control and nutrient-sensing pathways. In vascular
   endothelial cells, transcription factor EB controls important processes,
   including endothelial cell proliferation, endothelial tube formation,
   and nitric oxide levels, thereby influencing the inner blood-retinal
   barrier, angiogenesis, and retinal microvasculature. Additionally,
   transcription factor EB affects vascular smooth muscle cells, inhibiting
   vascular calcification and atherogenesis. In retinal pigment epithelial
   cells, transcription factor EB modulates functions such as autophagy,
   lysosomal dynamics, and clearance of the aging pigment lipofuscin,
   thereby promoting photoreceptor survival and regulating vascular
   endothelial growth factor A expression involved in neovascularization.
   These cell-specific functions of transcription factor EB significantly
   impact retinal aging mechanisms encompassing proteostasis, neuronal
   synapse plasticity, energy metabolism, microvasculature, and
   inflammation, ultimately offering protection against retinal aging and
   diseases. The review emphasizes transcription factor EB as a potential
   therapeutic target for retinal diseases. Therefore, it is imperative to
   obtain well-controlled direct experimental evidence to confirm the
   efficacy of transcription factor EB modulation in retinal diseases while
   minimizing its risk of adverse effects.

AB Subretinal fibrosis is the end-stage sequelae of neovascular age-related
   macular degeneration. It causes local damage to photoreceptors, retinal
   pigment epithelium, and choroidal vessels, which leads to permanent
   central vision loss of patients with neovascular age-related macular
   degeneration. The pathogenesis of subretinal fibrosis is complex, and
   the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Therefore, there are no
   effective treatment options. A thorough understanding of the
   pathogenesis of subretinal fibrosis and its related mechanisms is
   important to elucidate its complications and explore potential
   treatments. The current article reviews several aspects of subretinal
   fibrosis, including the current understanding on the relationship
   between neovascular age-related macular degeneration and subretinal
   fibrosis; multimodal imaging techniques for subretinal fibrosis; animal
   models for studying subretinal fibrosis; cellular and non-cellular
   constituents of subretinal fibrosis; pathophysiological mechanisms
   involved in subretinal fibrosis, such as aging, infiltration of
   macrophages, different sources of mesenchymal transition to
   myofibroblast, and activation of complement system and immune cells; and
   several key molecules and signaling pathways participating in the
   pathogenesis of subretinal fibrosis, such as vascular endothelial growth
   factor, connective tissue growth factor, fibroblast growth factor 2,
   platelet-derived growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor
   receptor-beta, transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway, Wnt
   signaling pathway, and the axis of heat shock protein 70-Toll-like
   receptors 2/4-interleukin-10. This review will improve the understanding
   of the pathogenesis of subretinal fibrosis, allow the discovery of
   molecular targets, and explore potential treatments for the management
   of subretinal fibrosis.

AB With an increase in global aging, the number of people affected by
   cerebrovascular diseases is also increasing, and the incidence of
   vascular dementia-closely related to cerebrovascular risk-is increasing
   at an epidemic rate. However, few therapeutic options exist that can
   markedly improve the cognitive impairment and prognosis of vascular
   dementia patients. Similarly in Alzheimer's disease and other
   neurological disorders, synaptic dysfunction is recognized as the main
   reason for cognitive decline. Nitric oxide is one of the ubiquitous
   gaseous cellular messengers involved in multiple physiological and
   pathological processes of the central nervous system. Recently, nitric
   oxide has been implicated in regulating synaptic plasticity and plays an
   important role in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia. This review
   introduces in detail the emerging role of nitric oxide in physiological
   and pathological states of vascular dementia and summarizes the diverse
   effects of nitric oxide on different aspects of synaptic dysfunction,
   neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction
   that underlie the progress of vascular dementia. Additionally, we
   propose that targeting the nitric oxide-sGC-cGMP pathway using certain
   specific approaches may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for
   vascular dementia.

AB Several experimental evidence suggests a link between brain Herpes
   simplex virus type-1 infection and the occurrence of Alzheimer's
   disease. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association
   are not completely understood. Among the molecular mediators of synaptic
   and cognitive dysfunction occurring after Herpes simplex virus type-1
   infection and reactivation in the brain neuroinflammatory cytokines seem
   to occupy a central role. Here, we specifically reviewed literature
   reports dealing with the impact of neuroinflammation on synaptic
   dysfunction observed after recurrent Herpes simplex virus type-1
   reactivation in the brain, highlighting the role of interleukins and, in
   particular, interleukin 1 beta as a possible target against Herpes
   simplex virus type-1-induced neuronal dysfunctions.

AB Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating, progressive neurodegenerative
   disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation of abnormal
   proteins, including amyloid plaques and intracellular tau tangles,
   primarily within the brain. Lysosomes, crucial intracellular organelles
   responsible for protein degradation, play a key role in maintaining
   cellular homeostasis. Some studies have suggested a link between the
   dysregulation of the lysosomal system and pathogenesis of
   neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. Restoring the
   normal physiological function of lysosomes hold the potential to reduce
   the pathological burden and improve the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
   Currently, the efficacy of drugs in treating Alzheimer's disease is
   limited, with major challenges in drug delivery efficiency and
   targeting. Recently, nanomaterials have gained widespread use in
   Alzheimer's disease drug research owing to their favorable physical and
   chemical properties. This review aims to provide a comprehensive
   overview of recent advances in using nanomaterials (polymeric
   nanomaterials, nanoemulsions, and carbon-based nanomaterials) to enhance
   lysosomal function in treating Alzheimer's disease. This review also
   explores new concepts and potential therapeutic strategies for
   Alzheimer's disease through the integration of nanomaterials and
   modulation of lysosomal function. In conclusion, this review emphasizes
   the potential of nanomaterials in modulating lysosomal function to
   improve the pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. The
   application of nanotechnology to the development of Alzheimer's disease
   drugs brings new ideas and approaches for future treatment of this
   disease.

AB Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent form of dementia characterized
   by the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
   consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau. Targeting amyloid-beta plaques
   has been a primary direction for developing Alzheimer's disease
   treatments in the last decades. However, existing drugs targeting
   amyloid-beta plaques have not fully yielded the expected results in the
   clinic, necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic
   strategies. Increasing evidence unravels that astrocyte morphology and
   function alter in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, with
   dysregulated astrocytic purinergic receptors, particularly the P2Y1
   receptor, all of which constitute the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's
   disease. These receptors are not only crucial for maintaining normal
   astrocyte function but are also highly implicated in neuroinflammation
   in Alzheimer's disease. This review delves into recent insights into the
   association between P2Y1 receptor and Alzheimer's disease to underscore
   the potential neuroprotective role of P2Y1 receptor in Alzheimer's
   disease by mitigating neuroinflammation, thus offering promising avenues
   for developing drugs for Alzheimer's disease and potentially
   contributing to the development of more effective treatments.

AB Microglia are present throughout the central nervous system and are
   vital in neural repair, nutrition, phagocytosis, immunological
   regulation, and maintaining neuronal function. In a healthy spinal cord,
   microglia are accountable for immune surveillance, however, when a
   spinal cord injury occurs, the microenvironment drastically changes,
   leading to glial scars and failed axonal regeneration. In this context,
   microglia vary their gene and protein expression during activation, and
   proliferation in reaction to the injury, influencing injury responses
   both favorably and unfavorably. A dynamic and multifaceted injury
   response is mediated by microglia, which interact directly with neurons,
   astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neural stem/progenitor cells. Despite
   a clear understanding of their essential nature and origin, the
   mechanisms of action and new functions of microglia in spinal cord
   injury require extensive research. This review summarizes current
   studies on microglial genesis, physiological function, and pathological
   state, highlights their crucial roles in spinal cord injury, and
   proposes microglia as a therapeutic target.
